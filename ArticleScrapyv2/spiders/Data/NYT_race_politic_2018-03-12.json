None are beautiful.\n\nThe eight stolid slabs awaiting Mr. Trump inside the razor wire in the border neighborhood of Otay Mesa were chosen from numerous proposals (the Department of Homeland Security refused to say how many) submitted to the agency last year. In soliciting ideas, the department said that each prototype would be judged, along with its impenetrability, on \u201caesthetics and innovative design.\u201d\n\nInnovation they got. Among the unsuccessful bidders was Clayton Industries, a Pittsburgh-based outfit that envisioned a 30-foot wall reinforced by sensors, an electrified chain-link fence and a railroad track dumping nuclear waste into a 100-foot deep moat. The waste is used as a power source.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a booby trap,\u201d said Chris Clayton, the company\u2019s president. \u201cWhat I was trying to do was to consolidate all the nuclear waste dumps and cesspools that are littered throughout the U.S. Why put up a simple concrete wall across the border when you can serve a couple of other functions? To the general public it might seem a little wild, but I made it to the second round.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther firms submitted concepts for walls topped by solar panels that would generate power, maybe even to sell, as a tricky way to get Mexico to pay for the wall. One company, National Consulting Service of National City, Calif., envisioned a wall topped by a monorail serving both nations, according to proposal information leaked to the San Diego Union-Tribune. The kicker: The train would feature \u201cvoice analysis technology to detect different emotional states of riders to possibly assist law enforcement.\u201d", "keywords": ["plans", "wall", "power", "submitted", "waste", "president", "wont", "trump", "prototypes", "san", "view", "topped", "nuclear", "national"], "polarity": 0.07419871794871793, "subjectivity": 0.4047619047619048},

The Pentagon publicly released the statement on Monday.\n\nMr. Nashiri was arraigned in 2011 over the Cole bombing, which killed 17 sailors. His case had dragged on through years of pretrial hearings until a military judge indefinitely shut it down last month because most of his defense lawyers had quit.\n\nAlthough the details have been murky, the defense lawyers had made clear that they had found something that raised concerns about their ethical obligation to protect the confidentiality of their communications with their client. They also complained that they could not talk to Mr. Nashiri about it because the details were classified, and that the judge, Col. Vance Spath of the Air Force, rejected their request for an evidentiary hearing to investigate the problem.\n\nColonel Spath and prosecutors have portrayed the mass resignation by the defense lawyers as essentially a stunt strategically timed to delay or derail the case, suggesting there was no basis for their concerns. Because the basic details were classified until recently, the defense lawyers have been limited in what they could say to rebut those accusations.\n\nBut the claim that the government had never previously put forward the explanation for the microphone sheds new light on the intensity of the recent sparring. Lt. Alaric Piette of the Navy, the only remaining lawyer representing Mr. Nashiri, also said the newly declassified statement was the first time the government said that the microphone was a legacy device and that a wire leading from it into the wall was not hooked up to anything.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If it is legacy, you can\u2019t tell,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe had not heard anything of this before.\u201d\n\nThe declassified statement and the interviews with the two defense lawyers also filled in other details about the highly disruptive incident in one of the most important war-crimes cases arising from the conflict with Al Qaeda.\n\nFor example, Mr. Kammen said Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense team had already grown suspicious that its conversations with its client might be subject to surreptitious monitoring because of an earlier incident, although he said he could not describe it because its details might be classified.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere was at least one episode, I\u2019m comfortable saying, that absolutely caused us to believe that there was ongoing eavesdropping,\u201d he said.\n\nIn April 2017, the statement said, it came to light that confidential conversations involving other detainees and their lawyers elsewhere in the prison complex had been \u201cunintentionally overheard.\u201d As a result, Brig. Gen. John Baker, who oversees military commissions defense lawyers, sent an email in June warning all defense lawyers of confidentiality problems.\n\nDays after that email, Mr. Kammen said, the government told defense lawyers that everything related to General Baker\u2019s email was classified \u2014 a sweeping edict that raised their suspicions and prompted the search that found the microphone in August. After the discovery, the defense filed a classified motion asking Colonel Spath for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nBut the judge denied its request to investigate, finding that, as he put it in open court, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any basis to find there had been an intrusion into attorney-client communications between this accused and this defense team.\u201d The judge also later dismissed their concerns as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nBoth lawyers said they were puzzled by Colonel Spath, who has indicated he may retire. Lieutenant Piette said that at one point, when the judge declared there was no evidence to support defense concerns about confidentiality, he grew worried that maybe the judge only knew about the earlier incident involving other detainees and other lawyers.\n\nDuring a break in the hearing, he said, he ran back to his office to verify that the defense had included a statement of facts about the microphone discovery with its classified filings.", "keywords": ["microphone", "classified", "defense", "hidden", "governments", "challenge", "mr", "spath", "guant\u00e1namo", "explanation", "details", "email", "lawyers", "statement", "judge"], "polarity": 0.053374786829332284, "subjectivity": 0.39263072281254097},

It was a reversal of weeks of repeated promises to act, and the latest of years of conflicting positions he has taken on a range of gun issues, from background checks to arming teachers.\n\nVague and contradictory positions on background checks\n\nMr. Trump has said he supports requiring background checks for gun purchases, and at various times has even called for strengthening such measures. However, he has also questioned whether background checks work and opposed expanding the system.\n\nOctober 1999:\n\n\u201cI favor you have to go through a process, but the fact is that the bad ones already have one, and they\u2019re not going to go through a process either; they\u2019re not going to go through any process.\u201d \u2014 Interview on CNN.\n\n2000:\n\n\u201cI also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.

We\u2019re going to be doing very strong background checks.\u201d \u2014 Listening session with teachers and students.\n\nA full reversal on the assault weapons ban\n\nWhile the ban was in place, Mr. Trump voiced his support. Fifteen years later, he called it a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d He recently suggested that he was open to at least considering a new ban on assault weapons sales.\n\n2000:\n\n\u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d\n\n2015:\n\n\u201cGun and magazine bans are a total failure.

I will.\u201d \u2014 Meeting with lawmakers.\n\nReconsidering idea of raising minimum age for gun sales\n\nAfter repeatedly and vociferously recommending that the age restriction for buying rifles and shotguns be raised to 21 from 18, Mr. Trump walked back his promise and suggested it was up to states to decide.\n\nFeb. 22, 2018:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18.

But I\u2019m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases \u2014 and a lot of people have made this case \u2014 teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201d \u2014 Interview on Fox News.\n\nFeb. 21, 2018:\n\nVideo At a listening session with grieving parents and school-shooting victims, including students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, President Trump suggested teachers should be allowed to carry firearms.\n\nFeb. 22, 2018:\n\nFeb. 22, 2018:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want teachers to have guns. I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns \u2014 if they really have that aptitude. ... But you could have concealed on the teachers.\u201d \u2014 Listening session with local and state officials on school safety.\n\nThe right to own guns, and the right to take them away\n\nFor decades, Mr. Trump consistently has said he supports the right to bear arms. But he has sometimes suggested confiscating the guns of certain segments of the population.\n\nOctober 1999:\n\n\u201cIf you could take the guns away from the bad guys, and there are plenty of them out there, I\u2019m all for it, but you can\u2019t. Now, if you had a law that says no guns, the people that are law abiding are going to go by that law, but the bad guys aren\u2019t, so they\u2019re going to have all the guns and the good guys aren\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLook, there\u2019s nothing I like better than nobody has them, but that\u2019s not going to happen, Larry. So, as long as that\u2019s not going to happen, I say you have to be allowed to have a gun.\u201d \u2014 Interview on CNN.\n\nNov. 18, 1999:\n\n\u201cWell, I think you have to have the right to have a gun. Now, I hate the concept of guns. I\u2019m not in favor of it, except for one thing: The bad guys are going to have them.\u201d \u2014 Interview on MSNBC.\n\n2015:\n\n\u201cWe have to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health issues.

That was when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a government panel that typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, said it would stall Broadcom\u2019s bid because of national security concerns while it examined the deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom said it was reviewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order, and disputed the notion that the bid posed a security threat.\n\n\u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d a company spokesman said in a statement.\n\nWhile Broadcom is based in Singapore, China was the main concern that drove Mr. Trump\u2019s decision over the Qualcomm deal, because allowing an American technology company to be acquired would cede its primacy in the semiconductor and wireless industry.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said in a statement that the decision was part of the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to take all actions necessary to protect the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said the order was based \u201con the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only and is not intended to make any other statement about Broadcom or its employees, including its thousands of hard working and highly skilled U.S. employees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the order will undoubtedly raise questions about the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to intervene in private-sector decisions. While Qualcomm opposed Broadcom\u2019s bid and had reached out to the foreign investment committee for a review, the proposal was nonetheless headed to the company\u2019s shareholders for a vote. The foreign investment committee intervened before that could happen, refusing to let the shareholder meeting take place until after it had a chance to investigate.\n\nJohn P. Kabealo, an attorney who specializes in foreign investment matters, said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that Mr. Trump would intervene in the transaction before a full investigation by the government panel was complete.\n\n\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

The panel had said that the leadership of Qualcomm, which makes wireless chips and also licenses key wireless patents, was too important to let go of. The committee argued that economic leadership in next-generation high-speed mobile networks known as 5G, in which Qualcomm is a key player, was also a national security interest.\n\n\u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,\u201d a United States Treasury official wrote in a letter to the companies last week.\n\nAs part of the presidential order, the United States also barred the 15 individuals who Broadcom had proposed for Qualcomm\u2019s board from running, saying they were \u201cdisqualified from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm.\u201d\n\nQualcomm acknowledged receiving the presidential order and said it had been told to reconvene its shareholder meeting at the earliest possible date, March 23.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA presidential action against foreign investment in an American company is rare and has only taken place four times in the past 30 years, according to the law firm Ropes & Gray. Scrutiny of foreign companies buying United States assets ramped up under President Barack Obama, including a presidential order barring a Chinese company from purchasing Aixtron, a German company with American assets, on national security grounds in 2016.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, several deals involving foreign buyers have been squelched after a review by the foreign investment committee, including Moneygram\u2019s sale to an affiliate of the Alibaba Group and Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s sale to an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. But the action against Broadcom was unusual because mergers are rarely killed before a publicly traded company\u2019s shareholders are given the chance to decide on the offer for themselves.\n\nThe decision was a blow to Broadcom, which under its chief executive, Hock Tan, has built itself up through several acquisitions. Mr. Tan had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration, including appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.\n\nBroadcom had at one point in its negotiations with Qualcomm also offered to up its offer to acquire the company. After the foreign investment committee announced its investigation into the Qualcomm bid this month, Broadcom hastened plans to move its headquarters to the United States and sent a letter to lawmakers promising it would not slow research and development in 5G networking technology if the merger were approved.", "keywords": ["committee", "foreign", "blocks", "qualcomm", "united", "mr", "broadcoms", "trump", "order", "broadcom", "investment", "security", "bid", "national"], "polarity": 0.06378863384677337, "subjectivity": 0.39110792308466724},

Noble, the senior director and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, the nonpartisan ethics watchdog group that filed the complaints against Ms. Conway. \u201cThere are clearly gray areas, but it\u2019s not like occasionally they stumble into the gray areas; this seems to be willful ignoring of the rules.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel, the federal agency which enforces the Hatch Act, has an email inbox and telephone hotline devoted to fielding complaints, and, according to one official, has heard about more potential violations since Mr. Trump was sworn in than is typical, particularly three years before a general election campaign. Over the eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, for example, the office received a total of six complaints about conduct by White House officials \u2014 a number Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has already surpassed.\n\nNot every complaint has led to a finding of a violation, and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides argue that many are meritless claims by political opponents looking for ways to undercut the president. They also point to the increase in the use of Twitter and other platforms that make it more difficult to maintain a bright line between the official and the political.\n\n\u201cThere are unprecedented efforts by outside political groups to use Hatch Act complaints as a vehicle to obstruct this administration, and exponential proliferation of social media platforms and messaging in this administration compared to any previous,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary.\n\nBut the office recommended last week that Mr. Trump take disciplinary action against Ms. Conway, for having breached the statute during two television interviews late last year in which she used her official title while arguing in favor of Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, and against his Democratic rival, Doug Jones, with the White House as her backdrop. White House officials have suggested that Mr. Trump is not likely to punish her.\n\nAt the same time, the office received a complaint against Mr. Kushner for having briefed White House officials during a staff meeting in the West Wing about Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, and its recent hire of Brad Parscale to lead the effort. It was the second Hatch Act complaint lodged against Mr. Kushner in two weeks, after one that cited his use of his White House title on a Trump campaign news release announcing Mr. Parscale\u2019s position.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials say they have made compliance with the Hatch Act a priority, providing multiple briefings to West Wing officials about how to avoid violations. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office has stepped up its warnings to employees about the law since Mr. Trump officially kicked off his re-election bid, circulating fresh guidance from the Office of Special Counsel last week informing staff that, among other things, they must not use MAGA \u2014 the acronym for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan \u2014 in official communications or in their social media accounts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she appeared on Thursday at a campaign event in western Pennsylvania for Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a special congressional election to be held on Tuesday, Ms. Conway made sure to note that she was there in her \u201cpersonal capacity.\u201d And when Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday to \u201cVote Rick\u201d using the MAGA hashtag, Stefan C. Passantino, the chief ethics lawyer in the counsel\u2019s office, circulated an email warning White House officials not to retweet it, according to White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal communications.\n\nPrevious administrations have also run afoul of the Hatch Act, particularly in the run-up to presidential elections. Two Obama administration cabinet officials \u2014 Kathleen Sebelius, his secretary of health and human services; and Juli\u00e1n Castro, his secretary of housing and urban development \u2014 were cited for violations during Mr. Obama\u2019s eight-year term, and a third, Hilda L. Solis, the secretary of labor, was investigated before she resigned.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

It issued a warning letter to Mr. Scavino for a tweet calling for the defeat in a primary of Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, who had been critical of the president. And it reported last year that Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, had breached the Hatch Act in June by retweeting Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of a South Carolina congressional candidate.\n\nMany other complaints have been investigated and dismissed. The office received a flood of calls in January, during a brief government shutdown, after the White House comment line informed callers that their inquiries could not be answered \u201cbecause congressional Democrats are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate.\u201d\n\nWhile the use of a taxpayer-funded public comment line to spread a partisan message was unusual in the view of many ethics experts, it was not considered a violation of the Hatch Act because it did not advocate for or against any one candidate.\n\nThe administration can largely decide how strictly to enforce the Hatch Act, because the agency charged with policing it has no power to mete out discipline. The Office of Special Counsel refers violations by White House officials and presidential appointees to the president, while cabinet secretaries determine how and whether to punish high-ranking officials in their agencies. In cases involving rank-and-file federal employees, the office can request disciplinary action by the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial agency.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have suggested in recent days that they take a relatively narrow view of the conduct prohibited by the Hatch Act, which has exemptions only for the president and the vice president. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week that Ms. Conway\u2019s interviews \u2014 in which she clearly expressed support for Mr. Moore and opposition to Mr. Jones \u2014 did not violate the Hatch Act because she was expressing the president\u2019s policy position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House Counsel\u2019s Office had made the same assertion to the Office of Special Counsel, which rejected the argument in its report reprimanding Ms. Conway. The office said the position \u201clacks merit,\u201d and \u201cwould render meaningless the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibition against using one\u2019s official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d\n\nIf the White House\u2019s position were adopted, the office said, \u201cfederal employees in their official capacity would be free to express electoral preferences and claim immunity from the Hatch Act by hiding behind the president\u2019s statements about candidates and declaring they were merely carrying out their official duties in support of the administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nWatchdog groups said they were concerned that the argument gave tacit permission to Trump administration officials to disregard the law.\n\n\u201cThe White House made clear that not only are they not going to take disciplinary action, but they didn\u2019t even accept the finding of a clear-cut case,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group that filed the complaints against Mr. Kushner. \u201cWhich seems to send the message to White House employees that they can do whatever they like.\u201d", "keywords": ["hatch", "trumps", "lines", "aides", "servants", "house", "act", "mr", "white", "trump", "partisans", "special", "blur", "public", "office", "legal", "officials"], "polarity": 0.07296592296592296, "subjectivity": 0.32187935521268857},

But for both Republicans and Democrats, there is far more at stake than a spot in the House.\n\nPresident Trump handed the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, a biting nickname. Outside Republican groups poured in over $10 million to prop up their choice, Rick Saccone. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said a Democratic victory could demonstrate how to reclaim some voters who abandoned the party in 2016.\n\nAll this, for a House race in a Pittsburgh-area district that will probably cease to exist for the next election cycle this year.\n\nThe special election Tuesday pits Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and federal prosecutor, against Mr. Saccone, a state representative and Air Force veteran, to serve out the last few months of the term of Representative Tim Murphy, a Republican who resigned in October after reports he encouraged a woman, with whom he had an affair, to have an abortion.\n\nThe contest has evolved into the latest test of whether Democrats can make inroads in a district Mr. Trump carried handily and whether a recent surge of liberal energy can propel Democrats to an upset victory. This is such a Republican-leaning district that Democrats did not even field a candidate in 2014 or 2016.\n\nThe polls will close at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday. Here is what to watch for.\n\nTrump as Saccone\u2019s Running Mate\n\nMr. Saccone has staked his candidacy on his support for the president, presenting himself as a sure-thing vote for the White House agenda. Mr. Trump, who won the district by about 20 percentage points, campaigned personally for Mr. Saccone, as did Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a top presidential aide.\n\n\u201cRick is going to vote for us all the time,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a weekend rally, where he called Mr. Saccone\u2019s rival \u201cLamb the Sham.\u201d\n\nBut polling has shown Mr. Trump\u2019s political appeal receding in the district, and a Monmouth University poll published on Monday found that his approval rating there was 49 percent \u2014 identical to his disapproval rating.\n\nMr. Lamb may also benefit from the Democratic enthusiasm seen in special elections since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, as angry voters on the left turn out to send a message of opposition to the president.\n\nIf Mr. Trump cannot deliver victory for Republicans in a district like this one, there may be few places for him to campaign helpfully in the fall. During a long and unfocused speech on Saturday night, Mr. Trump appeared aware of the personal stakes. \u201cI hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all watching because I won this district, like by 22 points.\u201d\n\nImage Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate, during a rally with the United Mine Workers of America in Waynesburg, Pa., on Sunday. Credit Antonella Crescimbeni/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, via Associated Press\n\nLamb\u2019s Pelosi Playbook\n\nRepublicans have battered Mr. Lamb with a familiar set of attacks meant to disqualify him with conservative-leaning voters. Most of all, they have tried to tie him to Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is intensely unpopular in districts like this one. Should Mr. Saccone prevail, it could be a testament to the enduring power of an attack Republicans have deployed every two years for a decade.\n\nBut Mr. Lamb has said that he would not support Ms. Pelosi for speaker of the House \u2014 and if he wins, other Democrats in Trump country might feel free to make the same pledge. When Republicans began airing Pelosi-themed ads, Mr. Lamb responded with a blunt commercial of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don\u2019t support Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Lamb said.\n\nMr. Lamb has broken with the national Democratic Party in other ways, too, declining to support new gun regulations and downplaying his disagreements with Mr. Trump. If that approach works, it would probably embolden other moderate Democrats to go their own way in deep-red areas, and perhaps encourage candidates across the board to distance themselves from Ms. Pelosi as a partisan lightning rod.\n\nTwo Americas in One District\n\nWhile it was historically steel-and-coal country, this district, like much of greater Pittsburgh, is more complex than the caricature drawn from its hard-hat past. Part of the reason this race has become so competitive is that the district includes affluent enclaves, like Upper St. Clair and Mt. Lebanon, that have previously gone Republican but are now uneasy with Mr. Trump, as voters are in other upscale suburbs across the country.\n\nThese communities, home to a swath of Pittsburgh\u2019s professional class and more than a few of the city\u2019s professional athletes and coaches, will have to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Lamb if he is to have a chance to win. He will need those votes to offset the more rural and Republican-leaning parts of the district, in the counties on the West Virginia border and in areas closer to Johnstown, Pa. This terrain is more unambiguously Trump country, and more closely resembles the western Pennsylvania conjured by the film \u201cThe Deer Hunter.\u201d\n\nThe district is not going to be around much longer. The state Supreme Court threw out the state\u2019s current congressional map as an unfair partisan gerrymander, and adopted a new map last month with very different district boundaries. Whoever wins on Tuesday will have to decide soon which new district to run in for the next election in November.\n\nThe Role of Unions\n\nMr. Trump would not have carried Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial Midwest in 2016 had it not been for the support he drew from rank-and-file union members.\n\nTo try to lure many of those Trump voters, Mr. Lamb has highlighted his military service, voiced support for the president\u2019s steel tariffs, and generally done all he could to avoid the liberal label.\n\nIt was not by happenstance that Mr. Biden, with his ties to organized labor, was the only major national Democrat with whom he campaigned. Laying hands on Mr. Lamb at a union carpenter\u2019s facility recently, Mr. Biden offered a succinct bit of testimony: \u201cHe is not afraid to say the word \u2018union.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf Mr. Lamb prevails, it will probably be in large measure because he recaptured some of the unionized workers who have been drifting away from the Democrats. And Republicans know it: As part of their final push in the race, the leading House Republican \u201csuper PAC\u201d created a digital ad made to look like a cable television news report portraying Mr. Lamb as supposedly reaching a \u201cboiling point\u201d with labor unions. The headline on the screen says \u201cDemocrat Abandons PA Unions,\u201d as the ad makes note of Mr. Lamb saying he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThe Onslaught of Money\n\nIf Mr. Saccone wins, it will probably be because of the district\u2019s Republican lean and the torrent of money from outside conservative groups, an extraordinary investment to protect a safe seat even if it were not being redistricted out of existence.\n\nThe spending has illustrated both the advantages the political right enjoys and the challenges it faces in the midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans can rely on a constellation of well-financed outside organizations to step in, as they did in this race, when their candidate is unable to match a Democratic opponent\u2019s fund-raising.\n\nBut the groups\u2019 attempts to derail Mr. Lamb\u2019s campaign have also demonstrated how difficult it is to for Republicans to find an effective message. Though they have attacked Mr. Lamb on issues ranging from taxes to immigration to his record as a prosecutor, the race has remained competitive.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 11 of the New York edition with the headline: Election Spotlight: A Disappearing Seat In Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["support", "race", "election", "district", "house", "mr", "democrats", "trump", "democratic", "saccone", "special", "lamb", "watch", "republicans", "pennsylvanias"], "polarity": 0.10820403280929601, "subjectivity": 0.4267728411938937},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/health/gun-violence-research-cdc.html", "text": "To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the study\u2019s findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.\u2019s study of gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nThe result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesn\u2019t ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control.\n\nAlex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. \u201cWe\u2019re in the science business and the evidence-generating business,\u201d Mr. Azar said, \u201dand so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.\u2019\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs.\n\nThere is no shortage of ideas \u2014 or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem,\u201d said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. \u201cHow many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?\n\nThen there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries.\n\nAndrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, we\u2019ve been having arguments about factual matters for decades,\u201d Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns.\n\n\u201cThe N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis,\u201d Mr. Morral said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no research on that. We\u2019ve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure \u2014 one that the N.R.A. opposes.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201dWe need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.\n\nThe Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking \u2014 money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories.\n\nPrivate foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent \u2014 the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement.\n\nThose records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher.\n\nThe Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal \u2014 one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time \u2014 was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership.\n\nSince the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H.,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next year\u2019s appropriations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J.

The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions.\n\nThe C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful.\n\nResearch proponents want to make sure that new studies don\u2019t serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control.\n\n\u201cAlthough more gun research is needed,\u201d Dr. Frieden said, \u201cthere are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage.

Many commentators considered it a clear echo of the anti-Semitism that has plagued Russia\u2019s history since at least the 19th century.\n\nNachman Shai, an Israeli legislator, called the Russian leader\u2019s remarks a classic example of anti-Semitism. \u201cHis comments show that nothing has changed in viewing the Jews as responsible for all the world\u2019s evil,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis demands a strong reaction from the government of Israel.\u201d\n\nJonathan A.

Only then did he come out with the line about Ukrainians, Tatars and Jews.\n\nHowever, Mr. Putin\u2019s comment may well have been lost in translation.\n\nSpeaking in Russian to the NBC presenter Megyn Kelly, Mr. Putin spoke of \u201cRusskie,\u201d a term denoting ethnic Russians in opposition to other nationalities living in the country. Many Russian Jews have long self-identified as separate from ethnic Russians \u2014 a source of confusion among Americans who may miss the nuance.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came to America in 1991 and was asked at J.F.K. airport, \u2018Are you Russian?\u2019 I responded \u2018No, sir, I\u2019m Jewish,\u2019\u201d said Boruch Gorin, a senior aide to Russia\u2019s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, who has been supportive of the Russian leader. \u201cPutin\u2019s comments were lost in translation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Gorin noted that the Russian president rarely makes an effort to be politically correct, and in his speeches often intentionally separates ethnic Russians from the country\u2019s minorities. Mr. Putin is clued up on political sensitivities in the West, and often seems to delight in skirting right along the edge of what is acceptable to Western audiences.\n\nFor instance, knowing that gay rights is an important issue in the West but is viewed with broad distaste at home, Mr. Putin in 2004 made a dig that appeared to combine that distaste with an equal widespread aversion to popular uprisings.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the post-Soviet space, what concerns me are attempts to resolve political questions through extralegal means,\u201d he said at a news conference as a series of mass uprisings was sweeping the post-Soviet space. \u201cThe creation of a system of permanent revolutions, whether they be pink, or light blue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin flatly denied Kremlin involvement in the 2016 election interference in his interview with NBC.\n\n\u201cWhy have you decided the Russian authorities, myself included, gave anybody permission to do this?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe also said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if Russians had attempted to meddle in the election and said he would never extradite those charged to the United States to stand trial.\n\nThe issue is a fraught one for Mr. Trump. He has repeatedly called Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and views American conclusions about Russian meddling as a threat to his legitimacy as president.

In doing so, he made a number of false or misleading claims, including some The New York Times has previously checked.\n\n\u201cWe spent $7 trillion in the Middle East over a 17-year period, $7 trillion as of three months ago.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nMr. Trump has cited the $7 trillion figure several times before, and it appears to refer to an estimate of war spending that is regularly updated by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.\n\nThe $7 trillion figure closely resembles a Watson Institute estimate of future debt from war spending by 2053: $7.9 trillion. This would be in addition to increased veterans\u2019 care, terrorism-prevention spending and other \u201cmacroeconomic costs to the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nAlthough that figure is not from the last \u201c17-year period,\u201d the Watson Institute does have a comparable figure for that time. The institute says that spending from the State and Defense Departments for overseas contingency operations \u2014 the \u201cwar-related activities\u201d the federal government pays for to support efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq \u2014 totaled $1.88 trillion between the 2001 and 2017 fiscal years.\n\nRead more: 10 Falsehoods From Trump\u2019s Interview With The Times\n\n\u201cISIS, we have 98 percent of the land back.\u201d\n\nTrue, but needs context.\n\nMr. Trump is correct to say that the Islamic State has been forced from 98 percent of the territory it previously held in Iraq and Syria.

About 2.5 million jobs have been added in the 13 months since February 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office.

So I was in a different month and I said African unemployment is the lowest level in history. They killed me. Because it was the previous month. But here\u2019s the good news. The new month brought it down to the lowest level. So now it\u2019s the lowest level.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe unemployment rate for black Americans did indeed reach a historic low, 6.8 percent, in December. It then rose to 7.7 percent in January and came back down to a near-historic low of 6.9 percent in February.\n\nBut the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017, right before Mr. Trump took office.\n\nThese figures also do not provide a sense of the racial unemployment gap , which has remained unchanged.

And North Korea might want to give Mr. Trump, who has expressed an interest in military parades, a display of its own.\n\nWhen Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 in an attempt to convince Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, to halt his ballistic missile program, she attended a mass propaganda performance that included an image of the very missile she was trying to get North Korea to curtail.\n\nJeju Island, South Korea\n\nThe governor of the South Korean island of Jeju has proposed holding the meeting there. The island, south of the Korean Peninsula, is a tourist destination, and its relatively small size and population could make security easier than in a large city like Seoul, the South\u2019s capital.\n\nWashington\n\nPhoto\n\nWashington would also be a potential spot, although Mr. Kim would most likely be wary of making the American capital his first trip abroad as North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\nA meeting there would also be awkward for the White House, which would be wary of the propaganda value it could give the North. When Marshal Jo Myong-rok, a high-level North Korean military official, visited Washington in 2000 to invite Mr. Clinton to Pyongyang, he first met with Dr. Albright while wearing a business suit. He then changed into a medal-festooned military uniform and high-brimmed hat to meet with Mr. Clinton, creating an uncomfortable image for the White House.\n\nBeijing\n\nChina is North Korea\u2019s only significant ally, although their relationship has hardly been close in recent years. Still, China was one of the few countries Kim Jong-il traveled to as North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\nChina has also played an active role in promoting negotiations among all sides and was a host to the so-called six-party talks a decade ago. Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Friday that China welcomed the meeting and would \u201ccontinue to make unremitting efforts\u201d for a \u201cpeaceful settlement of the nuclear issue.\u201d But he did not directly answer a question about whether Beijing would be host.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeneva\n\nPhoto\n\nGeneva, the city in neutral Switzerland, has hosted high-level meetings between rivals, like between President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985.

Mr. Kim himself has not gone as leader, though. He canceled plans to travel to Moscow in 2015 for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. A visit to Moscow might not look good for Mr. Trump, either, given the charges that Russians tried to interfere in the 2016 election to help his campaign.\n\nStockholm\n\nSweden has long been a key intermediary between the United States and North Korea. The United States does not have an embassy in the North, and Sweden is the so-called protecting power that provides consular services for Americans, including meeting with citizens who are imprisoned there. Sweden has also been the site of talks between North Korean officials and experts from the United States, South Korea and elsewhere.

Sunstein\n\n199 pp. Harvard University. Paper, $7.95.\n\nCAN IT HAPPEN HERE?\n\nAuthoritarianism in America\n\nEdited by Cass R. Sunstein\n\n481 pp. Dey St./Morrow. Paper, $17.99.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to impeach a president.\n\nThe founders included the provision, from the very start, as the weakest, \u201cbreak the glass in case of emergency\u201d mechanism for reining in an out-of-control executive. He was already subject to a four-year term, so he would remain answerable to the people, and to two other branches of government, which could box him in constitutionally. But the founders\u2019 fear of creeping monarchism \u2014 the very reason for their revolution \u2014 and their deep realism about human nature led them to a provision, rooted in English constitutional precedent, whereby a rogue president could be removed from office by the legislature during his term as well. At the same time, it\u2019s clear they also wanted a strong executive, not serving at the whim of Congress, or subject, like a prime minister, to a parliamentary vote of \u201cno confidence.\u201d He was an equal branch of government, with his own prerogatives, empowered, in Hamilton\u2019s words, to conduct his office with \u201cdecision, activity, secrecy and dispatch.\u201d He stood very much on his own feet.\n\nAnd so the impeachment power was both strong and weak. Strong as it hovered as the ultimate sanction for any president who might push his luck, but weak insofar as it was deliberately limited to the offense of subverting the Constitution itself or betraying the United States in foreign affairs: the famously grave and yet vague Anglo-American terminology of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which included \u201cgreat and dangerous offenses.\u201d These were essentially serious political crimes, which was why they had to be dealt with in the political arena rather than the courts. They amounted to one core idea: If the president was to start acting like a king, he could be dispatched.\n\nBut if he was to start acting like an idiot, he could not be impeached. If he was psychologically disturbed but not mentally incapacitated, ditto. If he pursued ruinous policies, or faced enormous unpopularity, or said unspeakably reckless things, he could not be impeached. If he committed a whole slew of crimes in his personal capacity, he\u2019d be answerable to public opinion and regular justice, but not subject to losing his job. If his judgment was unstable, his personal behavior appalling or if he were to make the United States a laughingstock in the opinion of mankind, the impeachment provision did not apply.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd even then, the bar for impeachment was very high, as Cass R. Sunstein\u2019s elegant new monograph, \u201cImpeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide,\u201d explains: Both House and Senate would have to be involved and in favor; and conviction would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, ensuring that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. This is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times, and never actually pursued to conviction. The attempted impeachment of John Tyler in 1842 was rightly rejected by the House of Representatives by a margin of 127-83 (he was guilty of innovating the use of the veto on policy grounds alone), and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868(on the preposterous grounds that he had no right to appoint his own secretary of war) was turned back by a single vote in the Senate. The impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton in 1998 because of a civil sexual harassment suit squeaked through the House on partisan lines, 221-212, but failed in the Senate, with conviction on the least ludicrous obstruction of justice charge reaching only 50 votes out of a needed 67.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRichard Nixon resigned before a vote in the full House could be taken. Sunstein assesses his articles of impeachment thus: not impeachable for evading taxes (too personal a crime); probably impeachable for resisting a congressional subpoena (but a president could potentially make a legitimate, if dubious, claim about executive privilege); definitely impeachable for covering up an impeachable offense (abusing the powers of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Department of Justice to conceal evidence of an attempt to subvert an election by burglarizing the Democratic National Committee).", "keywords": ["senate", "president", "impeached", "donald", "house", "subject", "impeachable", "strong", "r", "trump", "impeachment", "start", "vote"], "polarity": 0.03190955004591369, "subjectivity": 0.4923541408086862},

Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, have promised a raft of new measures to address the problem.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlbany has a checkered record when it comes to sexual harassment, on both sides of the aisle, perhaps most notably of the disgraced Democratic power broker, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez. Mr. Lopez was accused in 2012 of sexually harassing several female staff members, graphic incidents, including groping, which later led to his resignation.\n\nIn 2014, a Buffalo-area assemblyman, Dennis H. Gabryszak, a Democrat, stepped down amid accusations that he sexually harassed several female staff members. In 2016, Angela M. Wozniak, a first-term Republican from western New York, was censured after an affair with a male staffer; she did not seek re-election.\n\nAnd as recently as last fall, the former Assemblyman Steven T. McLaughlin, an outspoken Republican, was disciplined for asking a female staff member to send him naked pictures of herself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the Lopez scandal, Sheldon Silver, then the speaker of the Assembly, was also harshly criticized for authorizing secret financial settlements to harassment victims. Such payments are now the subject of proposals from both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who introduced a bill last week that would outlaw such confidential settlements, echoing a similar push by Senate Democrats in January.\n\nThe Assembly has already passed internal rules banning confidential settlements, and has made other reforms, including the mandatory reporting of any sexual harassment complaint. It, too, is expected to introduce legislation confronting sexual harassment on Monday, after establishing a work group of members last month to study the issue.\n\nThe seeming commonality of purpose greatly increases the likelihood of a deal on the issue, even if the question of who will be doing the negotiating remains unsettled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Heastie, the Assembly speaker \u2014 has expanded to include Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway cadre of Democrats who collaborate with Mr. Flanagan to help rule the Senate.\n\nIn February, the governor\u2019s office indicated that Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the minority Democratic conference, would be part of negotiations, something she has asked to do. But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office would not explicitly say that Ms. Stewart-Cousins would actually be in the negotiation room during talks among the four men; rather, they said she would \u201cbe included,\u201d without clarifying what that means.\n\nPotentially further muddying negotiations is the situation surrounding Mr. Klein, who himself has been accused of forcibly kissing a former staffer in 2015. Mr. Klein denies that accusation, and his political partner in the Senate, Mr. Flanagan, has declined to investigate, saying that the accuser, Erica Vladimer, did not make a formal complaint. (Mr. Klein has since asked for a formal investigation from a state ethics panel.),\n\nMr. Flanagan was also criticized for approving a new sexual harassment policy that added an admonition to false accusers, which led some Albany observers to question whether the Legislature\u2019s heart was behind the measures.\n\n\u201cProcess is as important as outcome,\u201d said Alexis Grenell, a public affairs consultant and writer who once worked in state government. She added that the governor and others should include experts in sexual harassment and those who have reported being harassed, and even those who have been harassed and not reported it for fear of retaliation. \u201cAn all-male decision-making body is conflicted out of arriving at a meaningful solution,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, even the governor has been accused of talking in a patronizing manner in December to a female reporter in Albany. The reporter, Karen DeWitt, asked Mr. Cuomo a question about sexual harassment in state government; the governor shot back that she was doing \u201ca disservice to women\u201d by limiting the question\u2019s scope to Albany.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe state Democratic Party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, started a campaign on Wednesday to pass Mr. Cuomo\u2019s so-called Women\u2019s Agenda, quoting the governor as saying \u201c2018 will be the year for action against the culture of rampant sexism and misogyny.\u201d\n\nMs. Simon, who represents parts of Brooklyn, said that \u201cthere is almost no woman I know who has not been treated differently, and treated badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbany is no different from the rest of the world,\u201d she added. \u201cNot that long ago we were chattel.\u201d\n\nMs. Paulin plans to introduce legislation to require a survey every two years \u2014 coinciding with when a new Legislature is seated \u2014 to \u201cmeasure the legislative workplace climate as it relates to discrimination and harassment procedure.\u201d The letter itself asks the state to convene a task force \u201cto examine the pervasiveness of the problem of sexual harassment\u201d in New York workplaces, and \u201cevaluate the effectiveness of current policies and laws.\u201d\n\nAs for the incidents she said she had personally witnessed, she said she was uncomfortable about naming names.\n\n\u201cThis should not be about individuals but about the entire systemic change we need,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while those signing are not necessarily alleging misbehavior in their current workplaces in Albany, the letter\u2019s final line might well serve as a notice for the state\u2019s policymakers, Ms. Paulin said.\n\n\u201cOur work,\u201d it reads, \u201chas just begun.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "senate", "cuomo", "bad", "bipartisan", "mr", "shadows", "behavior", "state", "members", "staff", "sexual", "harassment", "tackling", "letter"], "polarity": 0.08447454576486833, "subjectivity": 0.4381770857577307},

In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.\n\nThe women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.\n\nA clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump\u2019s most cohesive block of support.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.\n\nAnd the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.\n\nBut it has not been easy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,\u201d added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. \u201cThis is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.\u201d\n\nSome evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.\n\nThey feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church.

One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.\n\nKaren Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer outspoken criticism is all the more notable given that the president of Liberty University, Mr. Falwell, remains one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders.\n\nEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.\n\nIn surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.\n\nEvangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.\n\nAnd even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\n\n\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.", "keywords": ["support", "women", "tiptoeing", "core", "voters", "mr", "president", "white", "evangelical", "trump", "away", "supporters", "begin", "religious", "evangelicals", "ms"], "polarity": 0.16382375340708674, "subjectivity": 0.42349687349687354},

The Pentagon publicly released the statement on Monday.\n\nMr. Nashiri was arraigned in 2011 over the Cole bombing, which killed 17 sailors. His case had dragged on through years of pretrial hearings until a military judge indefinitely shut it down last month because most of his defense lawyers had quit.\n\nAlthough the details have been murky, the defense lawyers had made clear that they had found something that raised concerns about their ethical obligation to protect the confidentiality of their communications with their client. They also complained that they could not talk to Mr. Nashiri about it because the details were classified, and that the judge, Col. Vance Spath of the Air Force, rejected their request for an evidentiary hearing to investigate the problem.\n\nColonel Spath and prosecutors have portrayed the mass resignation by the defense lawyers as essentially a stunt strategically timed to delay or derail the case, suggesting there was no basis for their concerns. Because the basic details were classified until recently, the defense lawyers have been limited in what they could say to rebut those accusations.\n\nBut the claim that the government had never previously put forward the explanation for the microphone sheds new light on the intensity of the recent sparring. Lt. Alaric Piette of the Navy, the only remaining lawyer representing Mr. Nashiri, also said the newly declassified statement was the first time the government said that the microphone was a legacy device and that a wire leading from it into the wall was not hooked up to anything.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gen. John Baker, who oversees military commissions defense lawyers, sent an email in June warning all defense lawyers of confidentiality problems.\n\nDays after that email, Mr. Kammen said, the government told defense lawyers that everything related to General Baker\u2019s email was classified \u2014 a sweeping edict that raised their suspicions and prompted the search that found the microphone in August.

But he has sometimes suggested confiscating the guns of certain segments of the population.\n\nOctober 1999:\n\n\u201cIf you could take the guns away from the bad guys, and there are plenty of them out there, I\u2019m all for it, but you can\u2019t. Now, if you had a law that says no guns, the people that are law abiding are going to go by that law, but the bad guys aren\u2019t, so they\u2019re going to have all the guns and the good guys aren\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLook, there\u2019s nothing I like better than nobody has them, but that\u2019s not going to happen, Larry. So, as long as that\u2019s not going to happen, I say you have to be allowed to have a gun.\u201d \u2014 Interview on CNN.\n\nNov. 18, 1999:\n\n\u201cWell, I think you have to have the right to have a gun. Now, I hate the concept of guns.

That was when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a government panel that typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, said it would stall Broadcom\u2019s bid because of national security concerns while it examined the deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom said it was reviewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order, and disputed the notion that the bid posed a security threat.\n\n\u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d a company spokesman said in a statement.\n\nWhile Broadcom is based in Singapore, China was the main concern that drove Mr. Trump\u2019s decision over the Qualcomm deal, because allowing an American technology company to be acquired would cede its primacy in the semiconductor and wireless industry.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said in a statement that the decision was part of the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to take all actions necessary to protect the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said the order was based \u201con the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only and is not intended to make any other statement about Broadcom or its employees, including its thousands of hard working and highly skilled U.S. employees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the order will undoubtedly raise questions about the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to intervene in private-sector decisions. While Qualcomm opposed Broadcom\u2019s bid and had reached out to the foreign investment committee for a review, the proposal was nonetheless headed to the company\u2019s shareholders for a vote. The foreign investment committee intervened before that could happen, refusing to let the shareholder meeting take place until after it had a chance to investigate.\n\nJohn P. Kabealo, an attorney who specializes in foreign investment matters, said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that Mr. Trump would intervene in the transaction before a full investigation by the government panel was complete.\n\n\u201cIt certainly aligns with the administration\u2019s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

The panel had said that the leadership of Qualcomm, which makes wireless chips and also licenses key wireless patents, was too important to let go of. The committee argued that economic leadership in next-generation high-speed mobile networks known as 5G, in which Qualcomm is a key player, was also a national security interest.\n\n\u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,\u201d a United States Treasury official wrote in a letter to the companies last week.\n\nAs part of the presidential order, the United States also barred the 15 individuals who Broadcom had proposed for Qualcomm\u2019s board from running, saying they were \u201cdisqualified from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm.\u201d\n\nQualcomm acknowledged receiving the presidential order and said it had been told to reconvene its shareholder meeting at the earliest possible date, March 23.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA presidential action against foreign investment in an American company is rare and has only taken place four times in the past 30 years, according to the law firm Ropes & Gray. Scrutiny of foreign companies buying United States assets ramped up under President Barack Obama, including a presidential order barring a Chinese company from purchasing Aixtron, a German company with American assets, on national security grounds in 2016.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, several deals involving foreign buyers have been squelched after a review by the foreign investment committee, including Moneygram\u2019s sale to an affiliate of the Alibaba Group and Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s sale to an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. But the action against Broadcom was unusual because mergers are rarely killed before a publicly traded company\u2019s shareholders are given the chance to decide on the offer for themselves.\n\nThe decision was a blow to Broadcom, which under its chief executive, Hock Tan, has built itself up through several acquisitions. Mr. Tan had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration, including appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.\n\nBroadcom had at one point in its negotiations with Qualcomm also offered to up its offer to acquire the company. After the foreign investment committee announced its investigation into the Qualcomm bid this month, Broadcom hastened plans to move its headquarters to the United States and sent a letter to lawmakers promising it would not slow research and development in 5G networking technology if the merger were approved.", "keywords": ["committee", "foreign", "blocks", "qualcomm", "united", "mr", "broadcoms", "trump", "order", "broadcom", "investment", "security", "bid", "national"], "polarity": 0.06378863384677337, "subjectivity": 0.39110792308466724},

Noble, the senior director and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, the nonpartisan ethics watchdog group that filed the complaints against Ms. Conway. \u201cThere are clearly gray areas, but it\u2019s not like occasionally they stumble into the gray areas; this seems to be willful ignoring of the rules.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel, the federal agency which enforces the Hatch Act, has an email inbox and telephone hotline devoted to fielding complaints, and, according to one official, has heard about more potential violations since Mr. Trump was sworn in than is typical, particularly three years before a general election campaign. Over the eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, for example, the office received a total of six complaints about conduct by White House officials \u2014 a number Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has already surpassed.\n\nNot every complaint has led to a finding of a violation, and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides argue that many are meritless claims by political opponents looking for ways to undercut the president. They also point to the increase in the use of Twitter and other platforms that make it more difficult to maintain a bright line between the official and the political.\n\n\u201cThere are unprecedented efforts by outside political groups to use Hatch Act complaints as a vehicle to obstruct this administration, and exponential proliferation of social media platforms and messaging in this administration compared to any previous,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary.\n\nBut the office recommended last week that Mr. Trump take disciplinary action against Ms. Conway, for having breached the statute during two television interviews late last year in which she used her official title while arguing in favor of Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, and against his Democratic rival, Doug Jones, with the White House as her backdrop. White House officials have suggested that Mr. Trump is not likely to punish her.\n\nAt the same time, the office received a complaint against Mr. Kushner for having briefed White House officials during a staff meeting in the West Wing about Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, and its recent hire of Brad Parscale to lead the effort. It was the second Hatch Act complaint lodged against Mr. Kushner in two weeks, after one that cited his use of his White House title on a Trump campaign news release announcing Mr. Parscale\u2019s position.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials say they have made compliance with the Hatch Act a priority, providing multiple briefings to West Wing officials about how to avoid violations. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office has stepped up its warnings to employees about the law since Mr. Trump officially kicked off his re-election bid, circulating fresh guidance from the Office of Special Counsel last week informing staff that, among other things, they must not use MAGA \u2014 the acronym for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan \u2014 in official communications or in their social media accounts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she appeared on Thursday at a campaign event in western Pennsylvania for Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a special congressional election to be held on Tuesday, Ms. Conway made sure to note that she was there in her \u201cpersonal capacity.\u201d And when Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday to \u201cVote Rick\u201d using the MAGA hashtag, Stefan C. Passantino, the chief ethics lawyer in the counsel\u2019s office, circulated an email warning White House officials not to retweet it, according to White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal communications.\n\nPrevious administrations have also run afoul of the Hatch Act, particularly in the run-up to presidential elections. Two Obama administration cabinet officials \u2014 Kathleen Sebelius, his secretary of health and human services; and Juli\u00e1n Castro, his secretary of housing and urban development \u2014 were cited for violations during Mr. Obama\u2019s eight-year term, and a third, Hilda L. Solis, the secretary of labor, was investigated before she resigned.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nConcerned about appearing to use his office or his administration improperly to boost Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, Mr. Obama barred members of his cabinet from addressing the Democratic National Convention in 2016.\n\nSince Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Office of Special Counsel has found violations by at least three officials, including Ms. Conway. It issued a warning letter to Mr. Scavino for a tweet calling for the defeat in a primary of Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, who had been critical of the president. And it reported last year that Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, had breached the Hatch Act in June by retweeting Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of a South Carolina congressional candidate.\n\nMany other complaints have been investigated and dismissed. The office received a flood of calls in January, during a brief government shutdown, after the White House comment line informed callers that their inquiries could not be answered \u201cbecause congressional Democrats are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate.\u201d\n\nWhile the use of a taxpayer-funded public comment line to spread a partisan message was unusual in the view of many ethics experts, it was not considered a violation of the Hatch Act because it did not advocate for or against any one candidate.\n\nThe administration can largely decide how strictly to enforce the Hatch Act, because the agency charged with policing it has no power to mete out discipline. The Office of Special Counsel refers violations by White House officials and presidential appointees to the president, while cabinet secretaries determine how and whether to punish high-ranking officials in their agencies. In cases involving rank-and-file federal employees, the office can request disciplinary action by the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial agency.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have suggested in recent days that they take a relatively narrow view of the conduct prohibited by the Hatch Act, which has exemptions only for the president and the vice president. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week that Ms. Conway\u2019s interviews \u2014 in which she clearly expressed support for Mr. Moore and opposition to Mr. Jones \u2014 did not violate the Hatch Act because she was expressing the president\u2019s policy position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House Counsel\u2019s Office had made the same assertion to the Office of Special Counsel, which rejected the argument in its report reprimanding Ms. Conway. The office said the position \u201clacks merit,\u201d and \u201cwould render meaningless the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibition against using one\u2019s official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d\n\nIf the White House\u2019s position were adopted, the office said, \u201cfederal employees in their official capacity would be free to express electoral preferences and claim immunity from the Hatch Act by hiding behind the president\u2019s statements about candidates and declaring they were merely carrying out their official duties in support of the administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nWatchdog groups said they were concerned that the argument gave tacit permission to Trump administration officials to disregard the law.\n\n\u201cThe White House made clear that not only are they not going to take disciplinary action, but they didn\u2019t even accept the finding of a clear-cut case,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group that filed the complaints against Mr. Kushner. \u201cWhich seems to send the message to White House employees that they can do whatever they like.\u201d", "keywords": ["hatch", "trumps", "lines", "aides", "servants", "house", "act", "mr", "white", "trump", "partisans", "special", "blur", "public", "office", "legal", "officials"], "polarity": 0.07296592296592296, "subjectivity": 0.32187935521268857},

Weltner, a Georgia Democrat, and three other members of Congress on a special panel of the House Committee on Un-American Activities that produced contempt citations against seven Ku Klux Klan officials. The investigation was credited with crippling the Klan in Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere.\n\nIt was the first time since the committee was created in the late 1930s that it had expanded its purview of subversion beyond Communism and, occasionally, fascism.\n\nMr. Buchanan began racially integrating his congressional staff. He was the first member of the Alabama congressional delegation to nominate black candidates to the military service academies. He championed the cause of oppressed black majorities in Rhodesia and South Africa.\n\nAnd he strayed from conservative Republican ranks, first to support Title IX of the 1972 Education Act, which required that colleges and universities give women equal opportunities in educational and sports programs, and then to favor extending the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. He lobbied for gender equality in the Foreign Service.\n\nStill, Mr. Goldwater loyally campaigned for Mr. Buchanan into the late 1970s as a \u201cfine progressive Republican.\u201d\n\nMr. Buchanan was also a vocal defender of Christians and Jews who were being persecuted in the Soviet Union and its satellites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1980, the conservative tide that swept Ronald Reagan to the presidency and Adm.

During a long and unfocused speech on Saturday night, Mr. Trump appeared aware of the personal stakes. \u201cI hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all watching because I won this district, like by 22 points.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLamb\u2019s Pelosi Playbook\n\nRepublicans have battered Mr. Lamb with a familiar set of attacks meant to disqualify him with conservative-leaning voters. Most of all, they have tried to tie him to Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is intensely unpopular in districts like this one. Should Mr. Saccone prevail, it could be a testament to the enduring power of an attack Republicans have deployed every two years for a decade.\n\nBut Mr. Lamb has said that he would not support Ms. Pelosi for speaker of the House \u2014 and if he wins, other Democrats in Trump country might feel free to make the same pledge. When Republicans began airing Pelosi-themed ads, Mr. Lamb responded with a blunt commercial of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don\u2019t support Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Lamb said.\n\nMr. Lamb has broken with the national Democratic Party in other ways, too, declining to support new gun regulations and downplaying his disagreements with Mr. Trump. If that approach works, it would probably embolden other moderate Democrats to go their own way in deep-red areas, and perhaps encourage candidates across the board to distance themselves from Ms. Pelosi as a partisan lightning rod.\n\nTwo Americas in One District\n\nWhile it was historically steel-and-coal country, this district, like much of greater Pittsburgh, is more complex than the caricature drawn from its hard-hat past. Part of the reason this race has become so competitive is that the district includes affluent enclaves, like Upper St. Clair and Mt. Lebanon, that have previously gone Republican but are now uneasy with Mr. Trump, as voters are in other upscale suburbs across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese communities, home to a swath of Pittsburgh\u2019s professional class and more than a few of the city\u2019s professional athletes and coaches, will have to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Lamb if he is to have a chance to win. He will need those votes to offset the more rural and Republican-leaning parts of the district, in the counties on the West Virginia border and in areas closer to Johnstown, Pa. This terrain is more unambiguously Trump country, and more closely resembles the western Pennsylvania conjured by the film \u201cThe Deer Hunter.\u201d\n\nThe district is not going to be around much longer. The state Supreme Court threw out the state\u2019s current congressional map as an unfair partisan gerrymander, and adopted a new map last month with very different district boundaries. Whoever wins on Tuesday will have to decide soon which new district to run in for the next election in November.\n\nThe Role of Unions\n\nMr. Trump would not have carried Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial Midwest in 2016 had it not been for the support he drew from rank-and-file union members.\n\nTo try to lure many of those Trump voters, Mr. Lamb has highlighted his military service, voiced support for the president\u2019s steel tariffs, and generally done all he could to avoid the liberal label.\n\nIt was not by happenstance that Mr. Biden, with his ties to organized labor, was the only major national Democrat with whom he campaigned. Laying hands on Mr. Lamb at a union carpenter\u2019s facility recently, Mr. Biden offered a succinct bit of testimony: \u201cHe is not afraid to say the word \u2018union.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf Mr. Lamb prevails, it will probably be in large measure because he recaptured some of the unionized workers who have been drifting away from the Democrats. And Republicans know it: As part of their final push in the race, the leading House Republican \u201csuper PAC\u201d created a digital ad made to look like a cable television news report portraying Mr. Lamb as supposedly reaching a \u201cboiling point\u201d with labor unions. The headline on the screen says \u201cDemocrat Abandons PA Unions,\u201d as the ad makes note of Mr. Lamb saying he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/health/gun-violence-research-cdc.html", "text": "To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the study\u2019s findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.\u2019s study of gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nThe result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesn\u2019t ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control.\n\nAlex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. \u201cWe\u2019re in the science business and the evidence-generating business,\u201d Mr. Azar said, \u201dand so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.\u2019\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs.\n\nThere is no shortage of ideas \u2014 or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem,\u201d said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. \u201cHow many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?\n\nThen there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries.\n\nAndrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, we\u2019ve been having arguments about factual matters for decades,\u201d Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns.\n\n\u201cThe N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis,\u201d Mr. Morral said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no research on that. We\u2019ve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure \u2014 one that the N.R.A. opposes.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201dWe need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.\n\nThe Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking \u2014 money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories.\n\nPrivate foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent \u2014 the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement.\n\nThose records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher.\n\nThe Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal \u2014 one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time \u2014 was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership.\n\nSince the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H.,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next year\u2019s appropriations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J.

The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions.\n\nThe C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful.\n\nResearch proponents want to make sure that new studies don\u2019t serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control.\n\n\u201cAlthough more gun research is needed,\u201d Dr. Frieden said, \u201cthere are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage.

Putin of Russia spoke to NBC News in Moscow this month. Credit Pool photo by Alexei Druzhinin\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Democratic leaders in the House and Senate implored President Trump on Monday to employ \u201call resources available\u201d to extradite 13 Russians charged last month with subverting the 2016 presidential election after Russia\u2019s president raised the possibility of Jewish involvement.\n\n\u201cEnsuring these Russian nationals stand trial in the United States is imperative for deterring Russia from future attacks on our democracy and would be a signal to those who seek to meddle with our election that such actions are not without consequences,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in his chamber, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, wrote in a letter to the White House.\n\nJewish groups in the United States and some Israeli politicians also joined in an uproar over comments by the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in which he appeared to suggest that Jews might have been behind the hacking attack on the 2016 election in the United States.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on NBC News over the weekend, Mr. Putin was asked about the 13 Russian citizens charged by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, looking into the election interference. The question prompted a long, meandering response from Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cMaybe they are not even Russians,\u201d Mr. Putin mused, \u201cbut Ukrainians, Tatars or Jews, but with Russian citizenship, which should also be checked. Maybe they have dual citizenship or a Green Card. Maybe the U.S. paid them for this. How can you know that? I do not know either.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, the comment was shared widely on social media. Many commentators considered it a clear echo of the anti-Semitism that has plagued Russia\u2019s history since at least the 19th century.\n\nNachman Shai, an Israeli legislator, called the Russian leader\u2019s remarks a classic example of anti-Semitism. \u201cHis comments show that nothing has changed in viewing the Jews as responsible for all the world\u2019s evil,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis demands a strong reaction from the government of Israel.\u201d\n\nJonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League, said that Mr. Putin\u2019s comment was redolent of the \u201cProtocols of the Elders of Zion,\u201d a forged document frequently cited by anti-Semites since its emergence in 19th-century Russia. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing to see the Russian president giving new life to classic anti-Semitic stereotypes that have plagued his country for hundreds of years,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAmong Democrats in Congress, patience with the White House\u2019s silence in the face of such Kremlin provocations is running thin. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi were joined by the top Democrats on the chambers\u2019 respective judiciary committees, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Jerrold Nadler of New York.\n\n\u201cWhile Putin\u2019s stance is not surprising, it is also simply unacceptable,\u201d they wrote in their letter.\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Mr. Putin\u2019s comment \u201cspeaks to anti-Semitic tropes that have spurred intolerance and ethnic violence for centuries, and it is disturbing that this type of anti-Semitism has seen a recent resurgence among populist, far-right leaders around the world. That President Trump has failed to condemn Putin\u2019s statement, just as he equivocated on Charlottesville, undermines America\u2019s moral responsibility to combat the kind of racism and anti-Semitism perniciously re-emerging today.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic letter outlines several steps that the Justice and State departments could take to try to force their extradition, such as pressing Interpol to issue what is effectively an international arrest warrant and using existing diplomatic channels, including raising the issue directly with Mr. Putin.\n\nAn Interpol notice \u201ccan severely restrict a fugitive\u2019s ability to live and travel overseas,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe indictment of the Russian nationals does not directly say that the Russian government sponsored the election interference campaign, but top American intelligence officials have publicly said that Mr. Putin directed and oversaw it.\n\nMr. Putin, in his extended, evasive answer, seemed to delight in speculating about various possibilities including that the hacking never happened, and that if it did, Russia had nothing to do with it, or that maybe it was the work of an American citizen living in Russia, or of Russian free agents working on their own or for an American company. Only then did he come out with the line about Ukrainians, Tatars and Jews.\n\nHowever, Mr. Putin\u2019s comment may well have been lost in translation.\n\nSpeaking in Russian to the NBC presenter Megyn Kelly, Mr. Putin spoke of \u201cRusskie,\u201d a term denoting ethnic Russians in opposition to other nationalities living in the country. Many Russian Jews have long self-identified as separate from ethnic Russians \u2014 a source of confusion among Americans who may miss the nuance.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came to America in 1991 and was asked at J.F.K. airport, \u2018Are you Russian?\u2019 I responded \u2018No, sir, I\u2019m Jewish,\u2019\u201d said Boruch Gorin, a senior aide to Russia\u2019s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, who has been supportive of the Russian leader. \u201cPutin\u2019s comments were lost in translation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Gorin noted that the Russian president rarely makes an effort to be politically correct, and in his speeches often intentionally separates ethnic Russians from the country\u2019s minorities. Mr. Putin is clued up on political sensitivities in the West, and often seems to delight in skirting right along the edge of what is acceptable to Western audiences.\n\nFor instance, knowing that gay rights is an important issue in the West but is viewed with broad distaste at home, Mr. Putin in 2004 made a dig that appeared to combine that distaste with an equal widespread aversion to popular uprisings.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the post-Soviet space, what concerns me are attempts to resolve political questions through extralegal means,\u201d he said at a news conference as a series of mass uprisings was sweeping the post-Soviet space. \u201cThe creation of a system of permanent revolutions, whether they be pink, or light blue.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin flatly denied Kremlin involvement in the 2016 election interference in his interview with NBC.\n\n\u201cWhy have you decided the Russian authorities, myself included, gave anybody permission to do this?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe also said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if Russians had attempted to meddle in the election and said he would never extradite those charged to the United States to stand trial.\n\nThe issue is a fraught one for Mr. Trump. He has repeatedly called Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and views American conclusions about Russian meddling as a threat to his legitimacy as president. Democrats and some Republicans have blasted him for not responding to the Russian effort more aggressively.\n\nMr. Trump said last year that Mr. Putin had assured him the Russians did not interfere in the campaign. \u201cI really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 letter also sounds an alarm about this year\u2019s midterm elections, warning that despite Mr. Putin\u2019s claims, Russian efforts are ongoing and must be taken seriously before November.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary and confounding how little your administration is doing to counter Putin\u2019s campaign to undermine our grand democracy,\u201d the Democrats wrote.\n\nNicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Matthew Luxmoore from Moscow.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump held a rally at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport on Saturday evening to try to shore up support for Rick Saccone, the Republican on the ballot in a special election on Tuesday to fill a House seat representing a conservative western Pennsylvania district.\n\nBut he spent most of his 75-minute speech veering into other topics, including foreign policy, trade and the economy. In doing so, he made a number of false or misleading claims, including some The New York Times has previously checked.\n\n\u201cWe spent $7 trillion in the Middle East over a 17-year period, $7 trillion as of three months ago.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nMr. Trump has cited the $7 trillion figure several times before, and it appears to refer to an estimate of war spending that is regularly updated by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.\n\nThe $7 trillion figure closely resembles a Watson Institute estimate of future debt from war spending by 2053: $7.9 trillion. This would be in addition to increased veterans\u2019 care, terrorism-prevention spending and other \u201cmacroeconomic costs to the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nAlthough that figure is not from the last \u201c17-year period,\u201d the Watson Institute does have a comparable figure for that time. The institute says that spending from the State and Defense Departments for overseas contingency operations \u2014 the \u201cwar-related activities\u201d the federal government pays for to support efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq \u2014 totaled $1.88 trillion between the 2001 and 2017 fiscal years.\n\nRead more: 10 Falsehoods From Trump\u2019s Interview With The Times\n\n\u201cISIS, we have 98 percent of the land back.\u201d\n\nTrue, but needs context.\n\nMr. Trump is correct to say that the Islamic State has been forced from 98 percent of the territory it previously held in Iraq and Syria.

About 2.5 million jobs have been added in the 13 months since February 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office.

And I made the mistake, because I didn\u2019t know it went up, and it wasn\u2019t quite as good but it wasn\u2019t historic. So I was in a different month and I said African unemployment is the lowest level in history. They killed me. Because it was the previous month. But here\u2019s the good news. The new month brought it down to the lowest level. So now it\u2019s the lowest level.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nThe unemployment rate for black Americans did indeed reach a historic low, 6.8 percent, in December. It then rose to 7.7 percent in January and came back down to a near-historic low of 6.9 percent in February.\n\nBut the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017, right before Mr. Trump took office.\n\nThese figures also do not provide a sense of the racial unemployment gap , which has remained unchanged.

And North Korea might want to give Mr. Trump, who has expressed an interest in military parades, a display of its own.\n\nWhen Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 in an attempt to convince Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, to halt his ballistic missile program, she attended a mass propaganda performance that included an image of the very missile she was trying to get North Korea to curtail.\n\nJeju Island, South Korea\n\nThe governor of the South Korean island of Jeju has proposed holding the meeting there. The island, south of the Korean Peninsula, is a tourist destination, and its relatively small size and population could make security easier than in a large city like Seoul, the South\u2019s capital.\n\nWashington\n\nPhoto\n\nWashington would also be a potential spot, although Mr. Kim would most likely be wary of making the American capital his first trip abroad as North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\nA meeting there would also be awkward for the White House, which would be wary of the propaganda value it could give the North. When Marshal Jo Myong-rok, a high-level North Korean military official, visited Washington in 2000 to invite Mr. Clinton to Pyongyang, he first met with Dr. Albright while wearing a business suit. He then changed into a medal-festooned military uniform and high-brimmed hat to meet with Mr. Clinton, creating an uncomfortable image for the White House.\n\nBeijing\n\nChina is North Korea\u2019s only significant ally, although their relationship has hardly been close in recent years. Still, China was one of the few countries Kim Jong-il traveled to as North Korea\u2019s leader.\n\nChina has also played an active role in promoting negotiations among all sides and was a host to the so-called six-party talks a decade ago. Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Friday that China welcomed the meeting and would \u201ccontinue to make unremitting efforts\u201d for a \u201cpeaceful settlement of the nuclear issue.\u201d But he did not directly answer a question about whether Beijing would be host.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeneva\n\nPhoto\n\nGeneva, the city in neutral Switzerland, has hosted high-level meetings between rivals, like between President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. And Kim Jong-un would have more familiarity with the country, where he studied in the late 1990s, than most other places.\n\nMoscow\n\nLike China, Russia has been an occasional destination for North Korean leaders. Mr. Kim himself has not gone as leader, though. He canceled plans to travel to Moscow in 2015 for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. A visit to Moscow might not look good for Mr. Trump, either, given the charges that Russians tried to interfere in the 2016 election to help his campaign.\n\nStockholm\n\nSweden has long been a key intermediary between the United States and North Korea. The United States does not have an embassy in the North, and Sweden is the so-called protecting power that provides consular services for Americans, including meeting with citizens who are imprisoned there. Sweden has also been the site of talks between North Korean officials and experts from the United States, South Korea and elsewhere. And last week a Swedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, reported that Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, would visit Sweden soon, fueling speculation about a possible meeting location.\n\nUlan Bator, Mongolia\n\nPhoto\n\nMongolia, which shares borders with Russia and China, has pursued a policy of neutrality in recent years and has good relations with both the United States and North Korea.

Sunstein\n\n199 pp. Harvard University. Paper, $7.95.\n\nCAN IT HAPPEN HERE?\n\nAuthoritarianism in America\n\nEdited by Cass R. Sunstein\n\n481 pp. Dey St./Morrow. Paper, $17.99.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to impeach a president.\n\nThe founders included the provision, from the very start, as the weakest, \u201cbreak the glass in case of emergency\u201d mechanism for reining in an out-of-control executive. He was already subject to a four-year term, so he would remain answerable to the people, and to two other branches of government, which could box him in constitutionally. But the founders\u2019 fear of creeping monarchism \u2014 the very reason for their revolution \u2014 and their deep realism about human nature led them to a provision, rooted in English constitutional precedent, whereby a rogue president could be removed from office by the legislature during his term as well. At the same time, it\u2019s clear they also wanted a strong executive, not serving at the whim of Congress, or subject, like a prime minister, to a parliamentary vote of \u201cno confidence.\u201d He was an equal branch of government, with his own prerogatives, empowered, in Hamilton\u2019s words, to conduct his office with \u201cdecision, activity, secrecy and dispatch.\u201d He stood very much on his own feet.\n\nAnd so the impeachment power was both strong and weak. Strong as it hovered as the ultimate sanction for any president who might push his luck, but weak insofar as it was deliberately limited to the offense of subverting the Constitution itself or betraying the United States in foreign affairs: the famously grave and yet vague Anglo-American terminology of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which included \u201cgreat and dangerous offenses.\u201d These were essentially serious political crimes, which was why they had to be dealt with in the political arena rather than the courts. They amounted to one core idea: If the president was to start acting like a king, he could be dispatched.\n\nBut if he was to start acting like an idiot, he could not be impeached. If he was psychologically disturbed but not mentally incapacitated, ditto. If he pursued ruinous policies, or faced enormous unpopularity, or said unspeakably reckless things, he could not be impeached. If he committed a whole slew of crimes in his personal capacity, he\u2019d be answerable to public opinion and regular justice, but not subject to losing his job. If his judgment was unstable, his personal behavior appalling or if he were to make the United States a laughingstock in the opinion of mankind, the impeachment provision did not apply.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd even then, the bar for impeachment was very high, as Cass R. Sunstein\u2019s elegant new monograph, \u201cImpeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide,\u201d explains: Both House and Senate would have to be involved and in favor; and conviction would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, ensuring that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. This is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times, and never actually pursued to conviction. The attempted impeachment of John Tyler in 1842 was rightly rejected by the House of Representatives by a margin of 127-83 (he was guilty of innovating the use of the veto on policy grounds alone), and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868(on the preposterous grounds that he had no right to appoint his own secretary of war) was turned back by a single vote in the Senate. The impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton in 1998 because of a civil sexual harassment suit squeaked through the House on partisan lines, 221-212, but failed in the Senate, with conviction on the least ludicrous obstruction of justice charge reaching only 50 votes out of a needed 67.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRichard Nixon resigned before a vote in the full House could be taken. Sunstein assesses his articles of impeachment thus: not impeachable for evading taxes (too personal a crime); probably impeachable for resisting a congressional subpoena (but a president could potentially make a legitimate, if dubious, claim about executive privilege); definitely impeachable for covering up an impeachable offense (abusing the powers of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Department of Justice to conceal evidence of an attempt to subvert an election by burglarizing the Democratic National Committee).", "keywords": ["senate", "president", "impeached", "donald", "house", "subject", "impeachable", "strong", "r", "trump", "impeachment", "start", "vote"], "polarity": 0.03190955004591369, "subjectivity": 0.4923541408086862},

Klein, the leader of the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway cadre of Democrats who collaborate with Mr. Flanagan to help rule the Senate.\n\nIn February, the governor\u2019s office indicated that Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the minority Democratic conference, would be part of negotiations, something she has asked to do. But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office would not explicitly say that Ms. Stewart-Cousins would actually be in the negotiation room during talks among the four men; rather, they said she would \u201cbe included,\u201d without clarifying what that means.\n\nPotentially further muddying negotiations is the situation surrounding Mr. Klein, who himself has been accused of forcibly kissing a former staffer in 2015. Mr. Klein denies that accusation, and his political partner in the Senate, Mr. Flanagan, has declined to investigate, saying that the accuser, Erica Vladimer, did not make a formal complaint. (Mr. Klein has since asked for a formal investigation from a state ethics panel.),\n\nMr. Flanagan was also criticized for approving a new sexual harassment policy that added an admonition to false accusers, which led some Albany observers to question whether the Legislature\u2019s heart was behind the measures.\n\n\u201cProcess is as important as outcome,\u201d said Alexis Grenell, a public affairs consultant and writer who once worked in state government. She added that the governor and others should include experts in sexual harassment and those who have reported being harassed, and even those who have been harassed and not reported it for fear of retaliation. \u201cAn all-male decision-making body is conflicted out of arriving at a meaningful solution,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, even the governor has been accused of talking in a patronizing manner in December to a female reporter in Albany. The reporter, Karen DeWitt, asked Mr. Cuomo a question about sexual harassment in state government; the governor shot back that she was doing \u201ca disservice to women\u201d by limiting the question\u2019s scope to Albany.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe state Democratic Party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, started a campaign on Wednesday to pass Mr. Cuomo\u2019s so-called Women\u2019s Agenda, quoting the governor as saying \u201c2018 will be the year for action against the culture of rampant sexism and misogyny.\u201d\n\nMs. Simon, who represents parts of Brooklyn, said that \u201cthere is almost no woman I know who has not been treated differently, and treated badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbany is no different from the rest of the world,\u201d she added. \u201cNot that long ago we were chattel.\u201d\n\nMs. Paulin plans to introduce legislation to require a survey every two years \u2014 coinciding with when a new Legislature is seated \u2014 to \u201cmeasure the legislative workplace climate as it relates to discrimination and harassment procedure.\u201d The letter itself asks the state to convene a task force \u201cto examine the pervasiveness of the problem of sexual harassment\u201d in New York workplaces, and \u201cevaluate the effectiveness of current policies and laws.\u201d\n\nAs for the incidents she said she had personally witnessed, she said she was uncomfortable about naming names.\n\n\u201cThis should not be about individuals but about the entire systemic change we need,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while those signing are not necessarily alleging misbehavior in their current workplaces in Albany, the letter\u2019s final line might well serve as a notice for the state\u2019s policymakers, Ms. Paulin said.\n\n\u201cOur work,\u201d it reads, \u201chas just begun.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "senate", "cuomo", "bad", "bipartisan", "mr", "shadows", "behavior", "state", "members", "staff", "sexual", "harassment", "tackling", "letter"], "polarity": 0.08447454576486833, "subjectivity": 0.4381770857577307},

Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201d\n\nIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.\n\nThe women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.\n\nA clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump\u2019s most cohesive block of support.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.\n\nAnd the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.\n\nBut it has not been easy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,\u201d added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. \u201cThis is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.\u201d\n\nSome evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.\n\nThey feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.\n\nKaren Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer outspoken criticism is all the more notable given that the president of Liberty University, Mr. Falwell, remains one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders.\n\nEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.\n\nIn surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.\n\nEvangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.\n\nAnd even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\n\n\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.", "keywords": ["support", "women", "tiptoeing", "core", "voters", "mr", "president", "white", "evangelical", "trump", "away", "supporters", "begin", "religious", "evangelicals", "ms"], "polarity": 0.16382375340708674, "subjectivity": 0.42349687349687354},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/devos-school-prison-pipeline.html", "text": "Photo\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: \u201cCruz\u2019s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward\u2019s much-celebrated \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 reforms.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "education", "secretary", "expand", "schooltoprison", "sign", "betsy", "school", "devos", "pipeline", "law", "60", "letter", "minutes"], "polarity": 0.03899602335648848, "subjectivity": 0.48572963857847584},

About 100 readers responded. Here are a selection of them, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n\u201cThe Brothers Garcia\u201d on Nickelodeon. It was my happiest TV day ever!

The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate.

Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view!

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning.

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come.

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["society", "identity", "patriotism", "common", "political", "form", "reclaim", "religious", "nationalism", "liberals", "collective", "nation"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

The powerful message was that this black man and his white fianc\u00e9e were facing her family (and the world) and saying that was O.K.

The show, which I saw reruns of as a child in the 1980s, introduced ideas like culture clash; it lightly made fun of American cluelessness about other countries, in the figures of Fred and Ethel.\n\nA comic genius, Lucy used slapstick and crocodile tears to combat her husband\u2019s machismo \u2014 and when you look at how Latina actors in her position are still forced to play stereotypes of the docile wife or the sexy spitfire, that still looks radical today.\n\n\u2014 Annie Correal, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI am not athletic, British or Indian. But Parminder Nagra, who played Jess Bhamra in \u201cBend it Like Beckham,\u201d was close enough.

Those were also the years when the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth was really grating me, and I was drawn to transgressive portrayals of Asians. Jon Moritsugu\u2019s movies, in all their anarchic glory, were a revelation, especially \u201cTerminal U.S.A.,\u201d which somehow made it onto TV in the 1990s despite all its gore and drug use.\n\nLater, Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cBetter Luck Tomorrow\u201d depicted a group of Asian-American high-school students who fall into a world of crime.

Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["students", "generation", "think", "simmons", "cultivating", "college", "today", "things", "able", "dont", "leadership", "prairie", "view", "say", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["fired", "spann", "review", "supremacy", "wilkerson", "mr", "white", "movie", "wonder", "bill", "memory", "reckons", "racial", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s.

This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/devos-school-prison-pipeline.html", "text": "Photo\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast an interview that Lesley Stahl conducted with Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary and one of the richest members of his very rich cabinet. It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: \u201cCruz\u2019s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward\u2019s much-celebrated \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 reforms.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "education", "secretary", "expand", "schooltoprison", "sign", "betsy", "school", "devos", "pipeline", "law", "60", "letter", "minutes"], "polarity": 0.03899602335648848, "subjectivity": 0.48572963857847584},

I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out.

They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

{"title": "\n                    Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/google-diversity-lawsuits.html", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["fired", "trying", "diversify", "mr", "employees", "lawsuit", "googles", "damore", "work", "internal", "google", "diversity", "hard"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it.

As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s election also revealed the limits of that ideal.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected?\n\nIf you were born after 1990, it\u2019s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe. It\u2019s not surprising that you would become, in Scott Alexander\u2019s terminology, a conflict theorist, not a mistake theorist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the conflict theorist worldview, most public problems are caused not by errors or complexity, but by malice and oppression. The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses. The first would be in revolutions \u2014 the French, Russian, Chinese and all the other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression \u2014 and the way they ALL wound up waist deep in blood.\n\nThe second would be in constitutionalism.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning.

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages?

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["society", "identity", "patriotism", "common", "political", "form", "reclaim", "religious", "nationalism", "liberals", "collective", "nation"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["students", "generation", "think", "simmons", "cultivating", "college", "today", "things", "able", "dont", "leadership", "prairie", "view", "say", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["fired", "spann", "review", "supremacy", "wilkerson", "mr", "white", "movie", "wonder", "bill", "memory", "reckons", "racial", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But no more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was elected to Parliament from a safe district last year, after winning only a third of the vote in the presidential election, far worse than her supporters had hoped.\n\nAnd she has been nearly silent ever since. Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible. The party has virtually disappeared as a national force.\n\nThe party congress this weekend in Lille was intended, in part, to reverse this. Ms. Le Pen has received authorization to change the National Front\u2019s name, still associated with the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his years of Holocaust denial and association with Nazi collaborators.\n\nKicked out of the party by his daughter in 2015, Mr. Le Pen called a name change \u201csuicidal\u201d in a recent interview. For the first time since the Front was founded in 1972, he is not attending the party congress.\n\nMs. Le Pen has herself expressed ambivalence about continuing in the role of party president, and some party activists interviewed here also suggested the Front\u2019s future is not inevitably tied to the woman who inherited the leadership from her father.\n\n\u201cFor now we\u2019re with Marine Le Pen.

Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

It was impossible to know then, but representation matters!\n\n\u2014 Taylor Alarcon\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for representation. The closest I\u2019ve come is with \u201cSmoke Signals.\u201d But as a biracial person, I\u2019m not a \u201creal\u201d Native American, according to some, but I also wasn\u2019t raised like my white peers. I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967. It was Jim Brown in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d: a strong, brave, athletic black man fighting with the good guys against the bad guys.\n\n\u2014 Darren Casonhua\n\nIt may seem bizarre, but \u201cMoonlight\u201d helped me better understand myself as an upper-middle-class heterosexual white woman growing up in the Midwest. Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe.

When her producer told her it must be nice to know exactly what everyone else should be doing, she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d When the movie ended I literally sat in the movie theater and cried in recognition.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Langenkamp\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["mirror", "hollywood", "im", "movies", "screen", "white", "film", "movie", "representation", "mulan", "black", "saw"], "polarity": 0.10436236628385391, "subjectivity": 0.37851373832778806},

We both knew it was just a courtesy, but I thought her old-world charm was very classy. We\u2019re now one of their preferred mortgage lenders.\n\nAn open-door policy\n\nMy office is just past the reception area as you exit the elevator. I chose that location by design, to be accessible. I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures.

I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001.

I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink. It was humorous and I was glad to see he could write well.\n\nPieces of history\n\nWhen I was overseeing Citibank marketing for Asia, a colleague gave me a framed replica of shoes worn by Chinese women who underwent foot-binding in the 10th century to keep their feet small as a symbol of social status. The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["york", "cultures", "lyttle", "credit", "usa", "president", "melissa", "los", "angeles", "walking", "bank", "bridges", "downtown"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017.

Then I worked for my dad\u2019s company, World Wide Technology, and realized very quickly it was not for me. Over a dinner, my dad said, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\u201d That stuck with me and got my wheels turning about what I was really passionate about.\n\nWhat comics did you like as a kid?\n\nI had a Marvel encyclopedia. I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader. We would be hanging by the pool, and she would read her books and I would read comics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally.

I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic.

So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D. Taylor\u2019s \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d (1976).\n\n\u201cMy thoughts on the book have nothing to do with my identifying with Meg,\u201d Ms. Mathis told me in a phone interview. \u201cBut I was intellectually challenged by it in a way that few books written for my age group at the time did. It expanded me but it also scared me and not with cheap thrills, but because it asked such compelling questions about evil. IT was a brain that was frightening and instructive.\u201d\n\nIt was only when the director Ava DuVernay announced that Storm Reid would play Meg as a biracial girl in the screen adaptation that my relationship with the character started to change. Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "keywords": ["york", "wrinkle", "africanamerican", "sign", "work", "book", "meg", "color", "films", "novel", "childrens", "saw", "ms", "hard"], "polarity": 0.09736605385956033, "subjectivity": 0.4660398043514926},

The second is about securing his legacy as the Martin Luther King of the North.\n\n\u201cWhat I want it to be is I helped urbanize the King movement,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI was the one that could bring the King movement into the Northern, urban centers.\u201d But where Dr. King\u2019s activism led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t amounted to national reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sharpton, 63, figured he\u2019d be retired by now.

All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office.

His mission is now different, and more modest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to preserve what you\u2019ve got done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not matter if he revokes the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of Dr. King.

He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side.

Ken Frazier on Death Row Cases and the Corporate Soul\n\nImage Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck. \u201cI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. Credit Mike Cohen for The New York Times\n\nThe role of the chief executive has never been more complex \u2014 or more consequential.\n\nBusiness leaders today are reshaping the internet, reimagining health care, upending transportation and more. But being a chief executive is no longer just about running a company. It means taking political stands on everything from immigration to gun rights. It means weighing in on tariffs and taxes \u2014 all while balancing short-term profits with long-term goals, dealing with activist investors and attracting talented employees.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the world\u2019s top chief executives \u2014 where they\u2019re coming from and how they deal with the challenges they face \u2014 The New York Times is bringing back Corner Office.\n\nFor nearly 10 years, Corner Office featured conversations about leadership and management with some 500 senior executives. The new Corner Office will build on this foundation and also cover the big issues of the day, from climate change to artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking to prominent chief executives at big companies, innovators at lesser-known start-ups and organizational leaders in philanthropy, sports and the arts.\n\nWe want you to join the conversation. Let us know whom we should interview, and what questions you want answered below. And stay tuned as we bring Corner Office to life with multimedia, how-to guides and live events.\n\nAs we considered whom to interview first, Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was right at the top of the list. Mr. Frazier has a powerful personal story and has built an exceptional career.\n\nRaised in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier attended Penn State University and Harvard Law School. He joined Merck in 1992, defending the company against major lawsuits while resisting calls to slash research and development budgets.\n\nLast year, Mr. Frazier made headlines as the first chief executive to resign from a presidential advisory council following Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating response to an outburst of white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

That\u2019s an artist.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d executive producer, Trish Kinane, who worked on the Fox version of the show from Season 12 to 15, as well, said Mr. Richie genuinely wanted to share his expertise. \u201cI think the viewers can really smell it when people are fake, because they\u2019ve seen these shows so often,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it excited him to think that he could be helping more than one person, through this process, change their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Perry said she insisted Mr. Richie join the panel after running into him one night at the Sunset Tower and spending hours listening to him talk about his experiences in the music industry. \u201cIt was just jaw-dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the producers and I put my foot down. I was like, Lionel Richie is the uncle, historian, the wisdom that we are missing on this show.\u201d\n\nHe has \u201cbountiful grace,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen he speaks, the whole room listens. He takes his time, he has patience, he doesn\u2019t feel the need to prove. He is Lionel Richie.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHAD \u201cIDOL\u201d EXISTED in the 1960s, when Mr. Richie was of auditioning age, he would have gone nowhere near it. As a young man, he was painfully shy. He likes to say he thanks God for the Commodores, because without them, he\u2019d never have discovered Lionel Richie.\n\nHe was born in Tuskegee, Ala., and grew up on the campus of Tuskegee University, a few doors down from the Oaks, Booker T. Washington\u2019s former home. He was a freshman economics major at Tuskegee when one of his future bandmates spotted him carrying a saxophone case and offered him a spot in the band that would become the Commodores.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Richie said, he\u2019d been contemplating dropping out of school to join the Episcopalian clergy. Then he did his first show with the band. The curtain rose, Mr. Richie heard the sound of young women screaming in delight, and there went his interest in the priesthood.\n\nAfter a nationwide tour opening for the Jackson 5, the Commodores signed to Motown, and Mr. Richie began to learn the lessons only experience can teach. Once, before a show, he decided to say hello to the members of Parliament-Funkadelic, whose dressing room was down the hall. \u201cThe door opens,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled, \u201cand that was when I realized, This is not Kansas, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\n\nMr. Richie, who had been an Air Explorer Scout back in Tuskegee, spent about 30 minutes in P-Funk\u2019s lair that night. \u201cEverybody was talented, everybody could sing, and everybody\u2019s naked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018This is the record business, man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the Commodores, Mr. Richie co-wrote the deathless wedding-reception staple \u201cBrick House,\u201d but soon discovered he had a knack for ballads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your James Taylor guy, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was your Carole King guy. I was your Marvin Gaye guy. Very sensitive. One of the things I heard growing up was, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Richie, the problem with Lionel is he\u2019s too sensitive.\u2019 And of course, all that meant was that I was a songwriter. I was not a football player, and I was not going to be a hunter. I\u2019m the guy that shot a bird one time and cried over the bird for the next two days, you know? That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nTuskegee was a bubble of black achievement in the pre-civil rights South, and Mr. Richie said he grew up insulated from many of the cold facts of race in America, including the de facto segregation of pop and R&B on commercial radio. When he began coming into his own as a writer he was almost willfully ignorant of those categories. His hits for the Commodores could be sentimental, even saccharine, but were also sneakily genre-defying. \u201cSail On\u201d is a lonely-loadout lament fit for a mid-70s Jackson Browne album; the 1977 smash \u201cEasy\u201d was pure country.\n\nIn 1978, the Commodores released the Richie-penned \u201cThree Times a Lady\u201d and many black radio stations drew the line, refusing \u2014 at the height of funk and disco \u2014 to play a waltz. Mr. Richie and the Motown promotion executive Skip Miller summoned a group of unconvinced D.J.s and program directors from around the country \u2014 \u201cMy biggest haters,\u201d Mr. Richie said \u2014 for a sit down at a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. There, with Kanye Westian bravado, the not-yet-30-year-old Mr. Richie announced his desire to be the greatest songwriter who\u2019d ever lived \u2014 as opposed to the greatest black songwriter \u2014 and then asked them personally to give his record a shot.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play it for a week or two, just to make sure,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it on at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Put it on in drive time. If it doesn\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d\n\nIt went. Mr. Richie\u2019s reputation grew. In 1980, Kenny Rogers called to commission a ballad, and Richie wrote, arranged and produced \u201cLady,\u201d the first record of that decade to top three different Billboard charts.\n\nAt Motown\u2019s urging he recorded a solo album, then another. He still assumed he\u2019d retire as a Commodore. He said everything changed after the 1984 Olympics. During the closing ceremony, in front of a worldwide TV audience, Mr. Richie performed \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d dancing on a mechanical riser like a single man atop a wedding cake.\n\nAt first, this didn\u2019t feel like a turning point. \u201cI left the house,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cwent and ran around this field for 20 minutes, got back in the car and left the stadium.\u201d\n\nThen he stopped at an intersection. \u201cI am three cars back from the red light,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are walking up to the car.\u201d He tapped the table urgently, imitating the manic energy of a swarm of excited fans. In that moment, he said, \u201cI became \u2018Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u2019 Lionel Richie All Night Long! Lionel Richie All Night Long! These people have just gotten off the plane from Taipei, but they know Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis period blurs together when he talks about it now. It wasn\u2019t all one year, but it feels that way. The Oscar nomination for \u201cEndless Love.\u201d The Olympics. Leaving the Commodores. Sitting with Michael Jackson, writing the USA for Africa charity single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d and meeting Jackson\u2019s albino python Muscles, who slipped into the studio unnoticed and greeted Richie with open jaws. (\u201cLionel, he wants to say hello to you,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled Jackson said. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a natural workaholic the pace was addictive at first, but Mr. Richie said being a star on that level also brought with it \u201cunbelievable stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the astronaut,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cand everything on planet Earth is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHe went home to Tuskegee to care for his dying father. Doctors found nodules on his vocal cords. His marriage grew strained, then imploded in tabloid-ugly fashion \u2014 in 1988, his first wife, Brenda, was arrested on an assault charge after catching Mr. Richie with another woman and kicking him in what newspapers referred to, perhaps politely, as the \u201cstomach area.\u201d\n\nBy the end of his most successful decade, Mr. Richie found himself at home in Tuskegee, living in his childhood bedroom. When he was at his lowest, a family friend dropped by, saying he\u2019d brought some inspirational music.\n\n\u201cAnd he brought my albums by,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe\u2019d labeled which songs to listen to. He said, \u2018Be sure to listen to the lyrics.\u2019 He gave me my music back.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Richie sat in his old bedroom, where he\u2019d spent many nights grooving to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cBand of Gypsys\u201d under black light, and listened to his own songs, the ones that had touched so many and brought them so much joy, so much comfort. He sat and cried and found the strength to go on.\n\nHe owns that house now, along with much of the land around it. Someday he wants to turn that land into a beautiful garden. And in that garden he intends to build another little house, where he\u2019ll keep all his memorabilia and awards. A kind of Lionel Richie museum, which visitors to Tuskegee might add to their itineraries along with Booker T. Washington\u2019s house and the field where the Tuskegee Airmen learned to fly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may go without saying that the house he means to build in that garden in Tuskegee will be a brick house, but Lionel Richie says it anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nMR. RICHIE MAY BE the only pop star who has counted both Nelson Mandela and Muammar el-Qaddafi among his die-hard fans. Of course, both of them are gone now. So, too, are many of the artists Mr. Richie thought of as his contemporaries, including Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston. In the time that Mr. Richie has been a public figure \u2014 and a parent to children who are also navigating public lives \u2014 the very nature of celebrity has been transformed by social media.\n\nMr. Richie\u2019s youngest daughter, Sofia, has been romantically linked to Scott Disick, the estranged partner of Kourtney Kardashian. Over dessert, Mr. Richie considered how the hubbub around this liaison compares to the early 2000s, when his daughter, Nicole, had her own moment of infamy while joined at the hip to Paris Hilton.\n\nMr. Richie said there\u2019s no comparison. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Nicole was the Gulf War. Nicole and Paris were Vietnam for me. Because I had no experience. What\u2019s happening now with Sofie is leaps and bounds easier, because I know how to approach it. With Nicole, it was like being shot in the head every morning. Did she get arrested? For what? We didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. To hear Mr. Richie describe it, fatherhood is a job not unlike being the elder-statesman judge on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d You\u2019re there to provide an example of constancy in an ever-changing world. The fact of your presence serves as a lesson unto itself.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where life should have scared me,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t. Why? Because I was 19 and my parents were the mountain. And I get it now. You know, one day I pulled out of that driveway with the Commodores, in a van with five guys with Afros the size of Kentucky. There was no Instagram, no nothing. They didn\u2019t know where we were until I called them again. I\u2019m sure it was not what they wanted. But I give them all the props in the world, because they faked it very well.\u201d", "keywords": ["house", "idol", "mr", "wants", "richie", "tuskegee", "know", "american", "hed", "night", "real", "commodores", "lionel", "teach"], "polarity": 0.1844574979114453, "subjectivity": 0.4648626775271511},

LaGuardia High School, another specialized school, admits students by audition and a review of academic records. The schools have long been criticized for not being representative of the overall population of the city\u2019s school system, which is 67 percent black and Latino.\n\nIn his first mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio pledged to overhaul the schools\u2019 admissions process, moving to a system that took into account multiple criteria. But, since being elected, he has not made any significant effort to do that. (Changing the admissions process for the three original schools, Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech, would require state legislation, which he has not pushed for.)\n\nInstead, the city has taken more modest steps, including expanding a free after-school test-preparation program and offering the admissions test during the school day at some middle schools that historically have not sent many students to the specialized schools. In the fall, the city revamped the exam, scrapping a section in which students had to take paragraphs with sentences that had been scrambled and reassemble them. The education department said the changes would make the test more equitable by better reflecting what students actually learn in school.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Sessions out!\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, Mr. Brown and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, both Democrats, appeared together in the Capitol to denounce the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportation.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento, is the first Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department has filed against a local or state government over its immigration policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt targets three state laws passed in recent months: one that limits state and local agencies\u2019 ability to share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers, unless they have been convicted of serious crimes; a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE to examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena; and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the state\u2019s immigration detention centers.\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday, saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE. The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions had another comparison in mind.\n\nWhat if, he asked, a state enacted legislation hampering the work of employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency? \u201cWould you pass a law to do that?\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the specifics of the laws, Mr. Sessions railed about several instances in which he said state officials had frustrated the work of federal law enforcement. He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

She said she issued the warning because \u201cI know that Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside the hotel ballroom on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions faced a polite, if somewhat divided, audience.\n\nSome police chiefs and sheriffs in liberal-leaning areas have argued that their agencies must distance themselves from ICE to avoid scaring off immigrant residents who may be more reluctant to serve as witnesses or come forward to report crimes. But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["speech", "california", "law", "mr", "enforcement", "state", "immigration", "federal", "ice", "jeff", "scolds", "problem", "laws", "sessions"], "polarity": 0.0743163526614231, "subjectivity": 0.3816108773855252},

It is the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman, and the diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm.

In issues of \u201cJungle Action,\u201d though, Mr. McGregor and the artist Rich Buckler began to expand the mythos of the Black Panther\u2019s homeland, Wakanda, and created the character of Erik Killmonger. After a handful of issues, Graham became the artist.\n\n\u201cBilly was the main artist on that first major Black Panther series,\u201d said Mr. Simmons, who helped out when Mr. McGregor was designing maps of Wakanda. \u201cAnd it ruffled a few feathers and there was a point where some of the editors said, \u2018Where are the white people?\u2019 And Don, this little short Scottish white dude from Rhode Island said, \u2018We\u2019re in Africa, we\u2019re in his kingdom!\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir run on \u201cJungle Action\u201d lasted until 1976, at which point Graham left Marvel, and the radar of comic book readers.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Marvel was his whole life,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let go of who he was and where he was from in order to be accepted in another world. He was already on to something else.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Graham\u2019s Black Panther contributions were just one chapter in his larger body of work exploring his heritage. He wrote heavily researched historical plays about the tap dance master Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson and Graham\u2019s uncle Paul, a one-pocket billiards champion better known as Detroit Slim. Other subjects included street magicians, griots and the radical group Move\u2019s standoff with authorities in Philadelphia.\n\nGraham won awards for his set designs; his plays were produced around the country. And so in the theater world, it was comic books that were the footnote. Billy Mitchell, who acted in some of Graham\u2019s plays, remembers seeing the Black Panther and Luke Cage illustrations hanging on the walls of his apartment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Graham would tell him he worked at Marvel Comics, Mr. Mitchell found it strange: \u201cHow many cats you know from Harlem were working for comic books?\u201d asked Mr. Mitchell, the official historian of the Apollo Theater, where Graham also performed stand-up and M.C.\u2019d performances by the Spinners and the O\u2019Jays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

They each wore a custom-made shirt: On the back was a picture of Billy Graham; on the front, one of his illustrations of T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, leaping through the air, flanked by the words \u201cBlack History.\u201d They liked the movie and stayed through the credits, but again the name they wanted to see was missing.\n\nThat week, though, Shawnna Graham found another treasure among Billy Graham\u2019s possessions: his wallet. Tucked inside was a picture of the granddaughter he\u2019d never met. \u201cIt almost made me feel as if this is what I am supposed to be doing for him,\u201d she said, \u201cand that he knew I\u2019d be the one to unveil his life story.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "times", "luke", "graham", "mr", "white", "theater", "marvel", "artist", "grahams", "cage", "panther", "draw", "black"], "polarity": 0.0908830541439237, "subjectivity": 0.3829251103164147},

Credit VSF\n\nBalkrishna Doshi doesn\u2019t talk just about his buildings. This architect, urban planner and educator talks about how his buildings aim to foster a sense of community, how space can promote inner peace, how cities can contribute to the health of a society.\n\nConsidered a pioneer of low-cost housing, Mr. Doshi, 90, is thrilled to have been awarded the 2018 Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s highest honor, which was announced on Wednesday. He is the first laureate from India, and worked with the 20th-century masters Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn.\n\n\u201cIt is a very wonderful thing that happened,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Ahmedabad, a city that was once the center of the nonviolent struggle for Indian independence. The award will be bestowed on Mr. Doshi, the 45th laureate, at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto in May.\n\nBut Mr. Doshi\u2019s 70-year career has always been about much more than prizes \u2014 of which he nevertheless has many \u2014 or international renown, of which he had relatively little, given that he is not a household name.\n\nImage Rendering of Aranya, a low-cost housing complex of houses, courtyards and pathways that aims to empower \u201cthe have-nots to realize their dreams through ownership,\u201d Mr. Doshi said, \u201cimproving their quality of personal and community life.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nMr. Doshi has been consumed with larger issues like social good and sustainability. And he bemoans a culture and profession that he sees as overly concerned with the bottom line. \u201cOne is all the time looking at financial returns \u2014 that is not only what life is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think wellness is missing.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Doshi means by \u201cwellness,\u201d he said, are considerations like how we can \u201cconnect with silence\u201d; how \u201clife can be lived at your own pace\u201d; and \u201chow do we avoid the use of an automobile.\u201d\n\nThe architect has brought this type of philosophical thinking to projects like his Aranya Low Cost Housing in Indore (1989), where more than 80,000 low- and middle-income residents now live in homes ranging from modest one-room units to spacious houses, with shared courtyards for families.\n\nHe also designed mixed-income housing for a life insurance corporation in Ahmedabad (1973), which combines income groups on three floors of a pyramidal housing block approached through a common staircase. The Vidhyadhar Nagar Master Plan and Urban Design in Jaipur (1984) features channels for both water harvesting and distribution. (The Vidhyadhar housing plan recalled Mr. Doshi\u2019s work with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, with its wide central avenues, and a study of Jaipur\u2019s Old City.)\n\n\u201cHousing as shelter is but one aspect of these projects,\u201d the Pritzker jury said in its citation. \u201cThe entire planning of the community, the scale, the creation of public, semipublic and private spaces are a testament to his understanding of how cities work and the importance of the urban design.\u201d\n\nMr. Doshi\u2019s emphasis on communal spaces is reflected in his own work studio, Sangath (roughly translated as \u201cmoving together\u201d), which includes a garden and outdoor amphitheater, spaces designed to foster the exchange of ideas. The mosaic tile in his studio also appears in the undulating roof of Mr. Doshi\u2019s underground art gallery in Ahmedabad, Amdavad ni Gufa (1994), which features the artwork of Maqbool Fida Husain.\n\nImage The undulating underground art gallery Amdavad ni Gufa in Ahmedabad (1994) features the work of Maqbool Fida Husain.

The architect said he has founded six schools, including the School of Architecture and Planning in Ahmedabad (1966-2012), where he is the dean emeritus. It was renamed CEPT University in 2002.\n\nHis educational buildings include the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), a series of interwoven streets, courts and classrooms inspired by traditional, mazelike temple cities in southern India.\n\nBorn in Pune, India, in 1927, Mr. Doshi began his architecture studies in 1947 at the Sir JJ School of Architecture in Mumbai. He then moved to London and to Le Corbusier\u2019s atelier in Paris, where in the 1950s he helped work on Chandigarh, the experimental Modernist city about 150 miles north of New Delhi. Mr. Doshi ultimately settled in Ahmedabad, where he helped supervise the construction of Le Corbusier\u2019s Mill Owners\u2019 Association Building (1954) and worked on other Corbusier projects, including the Sarabhai House in Ahmedabad (1955).\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Doshi founded his own practice, Vastushilpa \u2014 now Vastushilpa Consultants \u2014 which has five partners and 60 employees.\n\nThe firm\u2019s more than 100 projects include the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (1962), on which Mr. Doshi worked as an associate for Louis Kahn \u2014 an occasional collaboration that lasted more than a decade.\n\nHis work is deeply evocative of Indian history and culture, drawing on the grandeur of shrines and temples, the bustle of city streets and the local materials from his grandfather\u2019s furniture workshop.\n\nImage The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), inspired by traditional Indian cities and temples, integrates \u201cnature as well as human activities,\u201d Mr. Doshi said. Credit VSF\n\nHe does not set out to design an iconic structure. Rather, Mr. Doshi approaches his projects with an eye toward seeding miniature societies that its residents can expand and animate over time.\n\n\u201cArchitecture is not a static building \u2014 it\u2019s a living organism,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we add on coffee shops, restaurants, bookshops, so you can use the building? Can we bring life into what we create?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the role of an architect today?\u201d Mr. Doshi added. \u201cAre we going to be a service provider working for a client, or are we going to be useful to the society at large?\u201d\n\nImage Formerly known as the Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, now CEPT University, in Ahmedabad, India.

Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible.

I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967. It was Jim Brown in \u201cThe Dirty Dozen\u201d: a strong, brave, athletic black man fighting with the good guys against the bad guys.\n\n\u2014 Darren Casonhua\n\nIt may seem bizarre, but \u201cMoonlight\u201d helped me better understand myself as an upper-middle-class heterosexual white woman growing up in the Midwest. Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Amazing!\n\n\u2014 Donna Bailey\n\nThe first time I saw myself represented was in high school. Spike Lee made an all-black musical, \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d and I was in awe.

When her producer told her it must be nice to know exactly what everyone else should be doing, she said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d When the movie ended I literally sat in the movie theater and cried in recognition.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Langenkamp\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["mirror", "hollywood", "im", "movies", "screen", "white", "film", "movie", "representation", "mulan", "black", "saw"], "polarity": 0.10436236628385391, "subjectivity": 0.37851373832778806},

We both knew it was just a courtesy, but I thought her old-world charm was very classy. We\u2019re now one of their preferred mortgage lenders.\n\nAn open-door policy\n\nMy office is just past the reception area as you exit the elevator. I chose that location by design, to be accessible. I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures.

I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001.

My most prized literary possession is a 300-year-old compilation of \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a periodical that described basic social obligations during that time.\n\nFamily heirlooms\n\nWhen I was 18, I brought a mug from my college, Coe College in Iowa, to the woman in Pakistan who would become my wife. I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink. It was humorous and I was glad to see he could write well.\n\nPieces of history\n\nWhen I was overseeing Citibank marketing for Asia, a colleague gave me a framed replica of shoes worn by Chinese women who underwent foot-binding in the 10th century to keep their feet small as a symbol of social status. The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["york", "cultures", "lyttle", "credit", "usa", "president", "melissa", "los", "angeles", "walking", "bank", "bridges", "downtown"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017.

Then I worked for my dad\u2019s company, World Wide Technology, and realized very quickly it was not for me. Over a dinner, my dad said, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\u201d That stuck with me and got my wheels turning about what I was really passionate about.\n\nWhat comics did you like as a kid?\n\nI had a Marvel encyclopedia. I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader. We would be hanging by the pool, and she would read her books and I would read comics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally.

I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic.

So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D. Taylor\u2019s \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d (1976).\n\n\u201cMy thoughts on the book have nothing to do with my identifying with Meg,\u201d Ms. Mathis told me in a phone interview. \u201cBut I was intellectually challenged by it in a way that few books written for my age group at the time did. It expanded me but it also scared me and not with cheap thrills, but because it asked such compelling questions about evil. IT was a brain that was frightening and instructive.\u201d\n\nIt was only when the director Ava DuVernay announced that Storm Reid would play Meg as a biracial girl in the screen adaptation that my relationship with the character started to change. Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "keywords": ["york", "wrinkle", "africanamerican", "sign", "work", "book", "meg", "color", "films", "novel", "childrens", "saw", "ms", "hard"], "polarity": 0.09736605385956033, "subjectivity": 0.4660398043514926},

All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office.

He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side. If Jesse Jackson taught Mr. Sharpton how to organize, it was James Brown who taught him how to perform.\n\n\u201cI would watch what moves and what songs excited people, and I would take notes,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told me. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to keep people\u2019s attention.\u201d", "keywords": ["sharpton", "movement", "act", "mr", "al", "king", "dr", "civil", "reconsidered", "rights", "national"], "polarity": 0.10926573426573427, "subjectivity": 0.386868686868687},

As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Washington\u2019s former home. He was a freshman economics major at Tuskegee when one of his future bandmates spotted him carrying a saxophone case and offered him a spot in the band that would become the Commodores.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Richie said, he\u2019d been contemplating dropping out of school to join the Episcopalian clergy. Then he did his first show with the band. The curtain rose, Mr. Richie heard the sound of young women screaming in delight, and there went his interest in the priesthood.\n\nAfter a nationwide tour opening for the Jackson 5, the Commodores signed to Motown, and Mr. Richie began to learn the lessons only experience can teach. Once, before a show, he decided to say hello to the members of Parliament-Funkadelic, whose dressing room was down the hall. \u201cThe door opens,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled, \u201cand that was when I realized, This is not Kansas, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\n\nMr. Richie, who had been an Air Explorer Scout back in Tuskegee, spent about 30 minutes in P-Funk\u2019s lair that night. \u201cEverybody was talented, everybody could sing, and everybody\u2019s naked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018This is the record business, man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the Commodores, Mr. Richie co-wrote the deathless wedding-reception staple \u201cBrick House,\u201d but soon discovered he had a knack for ballads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your James Taylor guy, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was your Carole King guy. I was your Marvin Gaye guy. Very sensitive. One of the things I heard growing up was, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Richie, the problem with Lionel is he\u2019s too sensitive.\u2019 And of course, all that meant was that I was a songwriter. I was not a football player, and I was not going to be a hunter. I\u2019m the guy that shot a bird one time and cried over the bird for the next two days, you know? That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nTuskegee was a bubble of black achievement in the pre-civil rights South, and Mr. Richie said he grew up insulated from many of the cold facts of race in America, including the de facto segregation of pop and R&B on commercial radio. When he began coming into his own as a writer he was almost willfully ignorant of those categories. His hits for the Commodores could be sentimental, even saccharine, but were also sneakily genre-defying. \u201cSail On\u201d is a lonely-loadout lament fit for a mid-70s Jackson Browne album; the 1977 smash \u201cEasy\u201d was pure country.\n\nIn 1978, the Commodores released the Richie-penned \u201cThree Times a Lady\u201d and many black radio stations drew the line, refusing \u2014 at the height of funk and disco \u2014 to play a waltz. Mr. Richie and the Motown promotion executive Skip Miller summoned a group of unconvinced D.J.s and program directors from around the country \u2014 \u201cMy biggest haters,\u201d Mr. Richie said \u2014 for a sit down at a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. There, with Kanye Westian bravado, the not-yet-30-year-old Mr. Richie announced his desire to be the greatest songwriter who\u2019d ever lived \u2014 as opposed to the greatest black songwriter \u2014 and then asked them personally to give his record a shot.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play it for a week or two, just to make sure,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it on at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Put it on in drive time. If it doesn\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d\n\nIt went. Mr. Richie\u2019s reputation grew. In 1980, Kenny Rogers called to commission a ballad, and Richie wrote, arranged and produced \u201cLady,\u201d the first record of that decade to top three different Billboard charts.\n\nAt Motown\u2019s urging he recorded a solo album, then another. He still assumed he\u2019d retire as a Commodore. He said everything changed after the 1984 Olympics. During the closing ceremony, in front of a worldwide TV audience, Mr. Richie performed \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d dancing on a mechanical riser like a single man atop a wedding cake.\n\nAt first, this didn\u2019t feel like a turning point. \u201cI left the house,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cwent and ran around this field for 20 minutes, got back in the car and left the stadium.\u201d\n\nThen he stopped at an intersection. \u201cI am three cars back from the red light,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are walking up to the car.\u201d He tapped the table urgently, imitating the manic energy of a swarm of excited fans. In that moment, he said, \u201cI became \u2018Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u2019 Lionel Richie All Night Long! Lionel Richie All Night Long! These people have just gotten off the plane from Taipei, but they know Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis period blurs together when he talks about it now. It wasn\u2019t all one year, but it feels that way. The Oscar nomination for \u201cEndless Love.\u201d The Olympics. Leaving the Commodores. Sitting with Michael Jackson, writing the USA for Africa charity single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d and meeting Jackson\u2019s albino python Muscles, who slipped into the studio unnoticed and greeted Richie with open jaws. (\u201cLionel, he wants to say hello to you,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled Jackson said. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a natural workaholic the pace was addictive at first, but Mr. Richie said being a star on that level also brought with it \u201cunbelievable stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the astronaut,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cand everything on planet Earth is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHe went home to Tuskegee to care for his dying father. Doctors found nodules on his vocal cords. His marriage grew strained, then imploded in tabloid-ugly fashion \u2014 in 1988, his first wife, Brenda, was arrested on an assault charge after catching Mr. Richie with another woman and kicking him in what newspapers referred to, perhaps politely, as the \u201cstomach area.\u201d\n\nBy the end of his most successful decade, Mr. Richie found himself at home in Tuskegee, living in his childhood bedroom. When he was at his lowest, a family friend dropped by, saying he\u2019d brought some inspirational music.\n\n\u201cAnd he brought my albums by,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe\u2019d labeled which songs to listen to. He said, \u2018Be sure to listen to the lyrics.\u2019 He gave me my music back.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Richie sat in his old bedroom, where he\u2019d spent many nights grooving to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cBand of Gypsys\u201d under black light, and listened to his own songs, the ones that had touched so many and brought them so much joy, so much comfort. He sat and cried and found the strength to go on.\n\nHe owns that house now, along with much of the land around it. Someday he wants to turn that land into a beautiful garden. And in that garden he intends to build another little house, where he\u2019ll keep all his memorabilia and awards. A kind of Lionel Richie museum, which visitors to Tuskegee might add to their itineraries along with Booker T. Washington\u2019s house and the field where the Tuskegee Airmen learned to fly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may go without saying that the house he means to build in that garden in Tuskegee will be a brick house, but Lionel Richie says it anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nMR. RICHIE MAY BE the only pop star who has counted both Nelson Mandela and Muammar el-Qaddafi among his die-hard fans. Of course, both of them are gone now. So, too, are many of the artists Mr. Richie thought of as his contemporaries, including Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston. In the time that Mr. Richie has been a public figure \u2014 and a parent to children who are also navigating public lives \u2014 the very nature of celebrity has been transformed by social media.\n\nMr. Richie\u2019s youngest daughter, Sofia, has been romantically linked to Scott Disick, the estranged partner of Kourtney Kardashian. Over dessert, Mr. Richie considered how the hubbub around this liaison compares to the early 2000s, when his daughter, Nicole, had her own moment of infamy while joined at the hip to Paris Hilton.\n\nMr. Richie said there\u2019s no comparison. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Nicole was the Gulf War. Nicole and Paris were Vietnam for me. Because I had no experience. What\u2019s happening now with Sofie is leaps and bounds easier, because I know how to approach it. With Nicole, it was like being shot in the head every morning. Did she get arrested? For what? We didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. To hear Mr. Richie describe it, fatherhood is a job not unlike being the elder-statesman judge on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d You\u2019re there to provide an example of constancy in an ever-changing world. The fact of your presence serves as a lesson unto itself.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where life should have scared me,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t. Why? Because I was 19 and my parents were the mountain. And I get it now. You know, one day I pulled out of that driveway with the Commodores, in a van with five guys with Afros the size of Kentucky. There was no Instagram, no nothing. They didn\u2019t know where we were until I called them again. I\u2019m sure it was not what they wanted. But I give them all the props in the world, because they faked it very well.\u201d", "keywords": ["house", "idol", "mr", "wants", "richie", "tuskegee", "know", "american", "hed", "night", "real", "commodores", "lionel", "teach"], "polarity": 0.1844574979114453, "subjectivity": 0.4648626775271511},

LaGuardia High School, another specialized school, admits students by audition and a review of academic records. The schools have long been criticized for not being representative of the overall population of the city\u2019s school system, which is 67 percent black and Latino.\n\nIn his first mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio pledged to overhaul the schools\u2019 admissions process, moving to a system that took into account multiple criteria. But, since being elected, he has not made any significant effort to do that. (Changing the admissions process for the three original schools, Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech, would require state legislation, which he has not pushed for.)\n\nInstead, the city has taken more modest steps, including expanding a free after-school test-preparation program and offering the admissions test during the school day at some middle schools that historically have not sent many students to the specialized schools. In the fall, the city revamped the exam, scrapping a section in which students had to take paragraphs with sentences that had been scrambled and reassemble them. The education department said the changes would make the test more equitable by better reflecting what students actually learn in school.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Sessions out!\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, Mr. Brown and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, both Democrats, appeared together in the Capitol to denounce the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportation.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento, is the first Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department has filed against a local or state government over its immigration policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt targets three state laws passed in recent months: one that limits state and local agencies\u2019 ability to share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers, unless they have been convicted of serious crimes; a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE to examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena; and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the state\u2019s immigration detention centers.\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday, saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE. The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions had another comparison in mind.\n\nWhat if, he asked, a state enacted legislation hampering the work of employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency? \u201cWould you pass a law to do that?\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the specifics of the laws, Mr. Sessions railed about several instances in which he said state officials had frustrated the work of federal law enforcement. He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

She said she issued the warning because \u201cI know that Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside the hotel ballroom on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions faced a polite, if somewhat divided, audience.\n\nSome police chiefs and sheriffs in liberal-leaning areas have argued that their agencies must distance themselves from ICE to avoid scaring off immigrant residents who may be more reluctant to serve as witnesses or come forward to report crimes. But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["speech", "california", "law", "mr", "enforcement", "state", "immigration", "federal", "ice", "jeff", "scolds", "problem", "laws", "sessions"], "polarity": 0.0743163526614231, "subjectivity": 0.3816108773855252},

It is the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman, and the diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm.

In issues of \u201cJungle Action,\u201d though, Mr. McGregor and the artist Rich Buckler began to expand the mythos of the Black Panther\u2019s homeland, Wakanda, and created the character of Erik Killmonger.

He was already on to something else.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Graham\u2019s Black Panther contributions were just one chapter in his larger body of work exploring his heritage. He wrote heavily researched historical plays about the tap dance master Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson and Graham\u2019s uncle Paul, a one-pocket billiards champion better known as Detroit Slim. Other subjects included street magicians, griots and the radical group Move\u2019s standoff with authorities in Philadelphia.\n\nGraham won awards for his set designs; his plays were produced around the country.

Billy Mitchell, who acted in some of Graham\u2019s plays, remembers seeing the Black Panther and Luke Cage illustrations hanging on the walls of his apartment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Graham would tell him he worked at Marvel Comics, Mr. Mitchell found it strange: \u201cHow many cats you know from Harlem were working for comic books?\u201d asked Mr. Mitchell, the official historian of the Apollo Theater, where Graham also performed stand-up and M.C.\u2019d performances by the Spinners and the O\u2019Jays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

They each wore a custom-made shirt: On the back was a picture of Billy Graham; on the front, one of his illustrations of T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, leaping through the air, flanked by the words \u201cBlack History.\u201d They liked the movie and stayed through the credits, but again the name they wanted to see was missing.\n\nThat week, though, Shawnna Graham found another treasure among Billy Graham\u2019s possessions: his wallet. Tucked inside was a picture of the granddaughter he\u2019d never met. \u201cIt almost made me feel as if this is what I am supposed to be doing for him,\u201d she said, \u201cand that he knew I\u2019d be the one to unveil his life story.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "times", "luke", "graham", "mr", "white", "theater", "marvel", "artist", "grahams", "cage", "panther", "draw", "black"], "polarity": 0.0908830541439237, "subjectivity": 0.3829251103164147},

Credit VSF\n\nBalkrishna Doshi doesn\u2019t talk just about his buildings. This architect, urban planner and educator talks about how his buildings aim to foster a sense of community, how space can promote inner peace, how cities can contribute to the health of a society.\n\nConsidered a pioneer of low-cost housing, Mr. Doshi, 90, is thrilled to have been awarded the 2018 Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s highest honor, which was announced on Wednesday. He is the first laureate from India, and worked with the 20th-century masters Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn.\n\n\u201cIt is a very wonderful thing that happened,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Ahmedabad, a city that was once the center of the nonviolent struggle for Indian independence. The award will be bestowed on Mr. Doshi, the 45th laureate, at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto in May.\n\nBut Mr. Doshi\u2019s 70-year career has always been about much more than prizes \u2014 of which he nevertheless has many \u2014 or international renown, of which he had relatively little, given that he is not a household name.\n\nImage Rendering of Aranya, a low-cost housing complex of houses, courtyards and pathways that aims to empower \u201cthe have-nots to realize their dreams through ownership,\u201d Mr. Doshi said, \u201cimproving their quality of personal and community life.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nMr. Doshi has been consumed with larger issues like social good and sustainability. And he bemoans a culture and profession that he sees as overly concerned with the bottom line. \u201cOne is all the time looking at financial returns \u2014 that is not only what life is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think wellness is missing.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Doshi means by \u201cwellness,\u201d he said, are considerations like how we can \u201cconnect with silence\u201d; how \u201clife can be lived at your own pace\u201d; and \u201chow do we avoid the use of an automobile.\u201d\n\nThe architect has brought this type of philosophical thinking to projects like his Aranya Low Cost Housing in Indore (1989), where more than 80,000 low- and middle-income residents now live in homes ranging from modest one-room units to spacious houses, with shared courtyards for families.\n\nHe also designed mixed-income housing for a life insurance corporation in Ahmedabad (1973), which combines income groups on three floors of a pyramidal housing block approached through a common staircase. The Vidhyadhar Nagar Master Plan and Urban Design in Jaipur (1984) features channels for both water harvesting and distribution. (The Vidhyadhar housing plan recalled Mr. Doshi\u2019s work with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, with its wide central avenues, and a study of Jaipur\u2019s Old City.)\n\n\u201cHousing as shelter is but one aspect of these projects,\u201d the Pritzker jury said in its citation. \u201cThe entire planning of the community, the scale, the creation of public, semipublic and private spaces are a testament to his understanding of how cities work and the importance of the urban design.\u201d\n\nMr. Doshi\u2019s emphasis on communal spaces is reflected in his own work studio, Sangath (roughly translated as \u201cmoving together\u201d), which includes a garden and outdoor amphitheater, spaces designed to foster the exchange of ideas. The mosaic tile in his studio also appears in the undulating roof of Mr. Doshi\u2019s underground art gallery in Ahmedabad, Amdavad ni Gufa (1994), which features the artwork of Maqbool Fida Husain.\n\nImage The undulating underground art gallery Amdavad ni Gufa in Ahmedabad (1994) features the work of Maqbool Fida Husain. Mr. Doshi called it \u201ca challenge between an artist and an architect to give birth to the most unexpected.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nMr. Doshi described the gallery project as \u201ca challenge between an artist and an architect to give birth to the most unexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cSearching the uncommon meant raising fundamental questions,\u201d he added, \u201cmeaning of function, meaning of space, meaning of technology, structure and form.\u201d\n\nEducation is central to Mr. Doshi\u2019s work; he has taught and lectured all over the world. The architect said he has founded six schools, including the School of Architecture and Planning in Ahmedabad (1966-2012), where he is the dean emeritus. It was renamed CEPT University in 2002.\n\nHis educational buildings include the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), a series of interwoven streets, courts and classrooms inspired by traditional, mazelike temple cities in southern India.\n\nBorn in Pune, India, in 1927, Mr. Doshi began his architecture studies in 1947 at the Sir JJ School of Architecture in Mumbai. He then moved to London and to Le Corbusier\u2019s atelier in Paris, where in the 1950s he helped work on Chandigarh, the experimental Modernist city about 150 miles north of New Delhi. Mr. Doshi ultimately settled in Ahmedabad, where he helped supervise the construction of Le Corbusier\u2019s Mill Owners\u2019 Association Building (1954) and worked on other Corbusier projects, including the Sarabhai House in Ahmedabad (1955).\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Doshi founded his own practice, Vastushilpa \u2014 now Vastushilpa Consultants \u2014 which has five partners and 60 employees.\n\nThe firm\u2019s more than 100 projects include the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (1962), on which Mr. Doshi worked as an associate for Louis Kahn \u2014 an occasional collaboration that lasted more than a decade.\n\nHis work is deeply evocative of Indian history and culture, drawing on the grandeur of shrines and temples, the bustle of city streets and the local materials from his grandfather\u2019s furniture workshop.\n\nImage The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), inspired by traditional Indian cities and temples, integrates \u201cnature as well as human activities,\u201d Mr. Doshi said. Credit VSF\n\nHe does not set out to design an iconic structure. Rather, Mr. Doshi approaches his projects with an eye toward seeding miniature societies that its residents can expand and animate over time.\n\n\u201cArchitecture is not a static building \u2014 it\u2019s a living organism,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we add on coffee shops, restaurants, bookshops, so you can use the building? Can we bring life into what we create?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the role of an architect today?\u201d Mr. Doshi added. \u201cAre we going to be a service provider working for a client, or are we going to be useful to the society at large?\u201d\n\nImage Formerly known as the Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, now CEPT University, in Ahmedabad, India. Mr. Doshi called it a \u201cfrugal campus built on a brick kiln\u201d where the lack of physical boundaries induces \u201cformal and informal exchanges.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nRobin Pogrebin is a reporter on the Culture Desk, where she covers the art world, architecture, cultural institutions and occasionally theater.
