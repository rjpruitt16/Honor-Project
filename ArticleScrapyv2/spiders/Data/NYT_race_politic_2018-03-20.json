Party leaders are in talks with several potential candidates, the spokesman said, but have not yet decided which one to endorse.\n\nThe Third Congressional District of Illinois has not been represented by a Republican since 1975, and few people, besides Mr. Jones, believe he has a chance of winning the general election in November. Daniel Lipinski, a Democrat, has represented the district in Congress since 2005, and before that it was represented by his father, Bill Lipinski, since 1993.\n\nThe main political battle in the district this year has been a Democratic primary between Representative Lipinski and a progressive challenger, Marie Newman, 53. Both have denounced Mr. Jones.\n\nMr. Lipinski, 51, called Mr. Jones\u2019s beliefs \u201cbigoted and anti-Semitic\u201d and said they \u201cpersonally disgust me because I believe that every individual has a God-given right to be treated with dignity.\u201d\n\nErik Wallenius, Ms. Newman\u2019s campaign manager, said Mr. Jones\u2019s views were \u201cabhorrent and have no place in the Third District, or anywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Jones is a former member of the American Nazi Party and has been active in the white supremacist movement for years. As a student at the University of Wisconsin, Mr. Jones said, he founded a conservative campus newspaper and attended meetings of both the Young Republicans and a Nationalist Socialist student group.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ryan, was denounced by the Wisconsin Republican Party last month, and Joe Arpaio, the immigration hard-liner pardoned by President Trump, who said in January that he was running for United States Senate in Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt is just nuts that we are in this moment in time when we have intolerance really infecting our political process,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said.\n\nMr. Greenblatt pointed to an uptick in far-right recruiting on college campuses and a 57 percent increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents over the last year as signs that \u201cextremists feel emboldened\u201d in the current political climate.\n\n\u201cIt is a sad state, where we are,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cThis is a bigger problem than Arthur Jones.\u201d", "keywords": ["represented", "illinois", "gop", "primary", "district", "congressional", "denounced", "lipinski", "republican", "political", "arthur", "party", "greenblatt", "wins", "mr", "jones", "nazi"], "polarity": 0.051678593515328206, "subjectivity": 0.2901272197190564},

This is horrible.\u201d\n\nMs. DeVos said that she was \u201cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights,\u201d and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination.\n\nShe also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools.\n\n\u201cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education,\u201d Ms. DeVos said.\n\nShe also defended her agency\u2019s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month.\n\n\u201cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country.\n\nMs. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association.\n\nMs. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to \u201cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently.\u201d\n\nThe directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos\u2019s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee.\n\nOne week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times.\n\n\u201cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department\u2019s plans for fiscal year 2019,\u201d the email said. \u201cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency.\n\nThough the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department\u2019s programs and resources.\n\nMs. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, \u201cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about \u201ca disconnect\u201d between Ms. DeVos\u2019s administration and his office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don\u2019t have staff that understand how the system works,\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen said. \u201cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills.\u201d\n\nThe plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the most part, Ms. DeVos\u2019s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services.\n\nDetails of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul.\n\nUnion officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors.\n\nThe union said the agreement came \u201cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,\u201d which concluded with the department\u2019s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started.\n\nThe department said that the union \u201cspent more than a year dragging its feet,\u201d and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers.\n\nThe department put its final offer in place.", "keywords": ["education", "staff", "bias", "school", "plan", "sand", "head", "democrats", "office", "department", "ms", "budget", "racial", "devos", "departments", "tell"], "polarity": 0.050771364438031104, "subjectivity": 0.42803711720378373},

Bush on domestic policy, that is not good enough.\n\nMr. McConnell and other Republican leaders must \u201cmake it clear to Trump and the White House that if he fires Mueller, that is crossing a red line, and there will be consequences,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. One idea: Warn the president that Congress will hire Mr. Mueller to continue his inquiry if Mr. Trump fires him.\n\n\u201cI understand that this is not McConnell\u2019s thing to speak out and challenge people publicly, and maybe he is being extremely effective privately \u2014 and if he is, more power to him,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, what\u2019s said publicly matters, too. And at some point, if what Trump says and does is met with silence, it implies complicity for the party.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell learned the dangers of criticizing Mr. Trump in August, when he was asked in Kentucky about the Senate\u2019s struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Defending the chamber\u2019s work, Mr. McConnell offered an offhand assessment of how the president appeared to be learning on the job, saying Mr. Trump \u201chad excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nIt was hardly inflammatory, but the comment infuriated Mr. Trump, who responded with a Twitter tirade against the leader that lasted six weeks. The two did not speak for a long stretch during that period, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where Mr. McConnell privately expressed doubts that Mr. Trump could salvage his presidency.\n\nIn October, as suddenly as it began, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack ended.

Unlike other senators who linger in the Capitol corridors to talk with reporters, he shuns hallway interviews and rarely takes more than a few questions at his Tuesday briefings.

By Tuesday the book, which beat Ms. Pence\u2019s to Amazon by two days, had risen to the No. 1 spot on the website\u2019s best-seller list, knocking pre-ordered copies of the upcoming memoir by James Comey down to No. 2.\n\nMs. Pence\u2019s book on Marlon Bundo had reached No. 4 on the list by late afternoon.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\u201d has been highly anticipated for potential insights it could provide into the tumultuous Trump White House and Mr. Comey\u2019s abrupt dismissal as director of the F.B.I. last year.\n\nDueling tweets over the weekend between President Trump and Mr. Comey appeared to have propelled enough advance orders to lift Mr. Comey\u2019s memoir to the top spot. The memoir, scheduled to be released on April 17, has been advertised as a frank account of Mr. Comey\u2019s \u201cnever-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career.\u201d\n\nMr. Oliver\u2019s book is very different than that.\n\nIn it, Marlon Bundo, a snappily dressed bunny with a penchant for bright bow ties, falls in love with a bespectacled boy bunny named Wesley. Things seem to be going pretty well for the two lovebirds (love bunnies?) until a powerful stinkbug who bears a striking resemblance to Mr. Pence decrees that male bunnies cannot marry each other.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the grand tradition of children\u2019s literature, the story ends on a happy note. An image released by the book\u2019s publisher, Chronicle Books, shows Marlon Bundo and Wesley standing in a field, wearing tuxedos, as a cat in clerical garb marries them.\n\nThe tale also comes in the form of an audiobook voiced by a string of celebrities including Jim Parsons as Marlon Bundo and John Lithgow as the stinkbug, as well as Ellie Kemper, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and RuPaul. On Tuesday, it also beat Mr. Comey\u2019s audiobook to be the No. 1 best-seller on Audible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Oliver played clips from a cartoon version of the audiobook on his show on Sunday.

It is not known if it identifies Marlon Bundo\u2019s sexual orientation at all.\n\nCharlotte Pence seemed to take the John Oliver parody in stride. \u201cHis book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind,\u201d she said in an interview with Fox Business Network on Tuesday. \u201cWe have two books giving to charities that are about bunnies, so I\u2019m all for it really.\u201d\n\nSome of the proceeds from her book will be donated to A21, an organization that fights human trafficking. Mr. Oliver said all of his book\u2019s profits would be donated to The Trevor Project, a charity for L.G.B.T. youth, and AIDS United.\n\nThat was a pointed jab at Mr. Pence, who is a longtime opponent of L.G.B.T. rights, which he opposed as both governor of Indiana and a member of Congress.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pence described James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, which teaches that people can vanquish same-sex attraction if they \u201ccooperate with God in the process of becoming more like Jesus,\u201d as \u201ca friend and a mentor.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence has also long been dogged by claims that he supports anti-gay conversion therapy due in part to language contained on the website of his 2000 campaign for Congress. A spokesman for Mr. Pence said in 2016 that he does not support the practice, which has been denounced by the medical community.\n\nThe success of Mr. Oliver\u2019s book marks the second time in recent months that criticism of Mr. Pence\u2019s record on L.G.B.T. rights has turned into a pop culture moment.\n\nIn January, the figure skater Adam Rippon, the first openly gay American man to qualify to compete in the Winter Games, attracted wide media attention and became an overnight gay icon when he denounced Mr. Pence\u2019s gay rights record and refused to meet with him during the Games. The vice president\u2019s staff said Mr. Rippon had misrepresented Mr. Pence\u2019s views.", "keywords": ["book", "jumps", "pences", "oliver", "buy", "bundo", "mike", "marlon", "gay", "comeys", "pence", "books", "bunny", "childrens", "mr"], "polarity": 0.16066631927743039, "subjectivity": 0.4533532414087968},

But the document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for review and declassification before it can be released publicly, which could take weeks or months.\n\nMore than a year into its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling, the Intelligence Committee has thus far offered little visibility into its work. Witnesses have come and gone in relative secret. Staff members and lawmakers have pored over thousands of pages of documents related to the Trump campaign, as well as sensitive government secrets.\n\nAnd while the House Intelligence Committee shut down its investigation last week amid rancorous partisan disputes, the Senate panel is said to be nowhere near completion, with months of work left to go. Whether the increased scrutiny that comes with being the only remaining investigation on Capitol Hill will change that remains unclear.\n\nIn a show of bipartisan resolve, nearly every member of the committee took part in Tuesday\u2019s announcement and those who spoke endorsed the committee\u2019s findings.\n\nThe committee\u2019s leaders had last updated the public on the investigation in October, when they said that a review had broadly confirmed the conclusions of American spy agencies that President Vladimir V.

Ms. Clifford was to appear on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d three days later to discuss her relationship with Mr. Trump and the efforts Mr. Cohen undertook on his client\u2019s behalf to pay for her silence.\n\nMr. Trump joined a legal effort last week seeking some $20 million in penalties tied to Ms. Clifford\u2019s agreement.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe court dispute has drawn public attention to an issue that was previously sidelined. And both women\u2019s suits could provide more fodder for federal complaints from the watchdog group Common Cause that the payoffs were, effectively, illegal campaign contributions.\n\nMs. Clifford and Ms. McDougal tell strikingly similar stories about their experiences with Mr. Trump, which included alleged trysts at the same Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006, dates at the same Beverly Hills hotel and promises of apartments as gifts. Their stories first surfaced in the The Wall Street Journal four days before the election, but got little traction in the swirl of news that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The women even shared the same Los Angeles lawyer, Keith Davidson, who has long worked for clients who sell their stories to the tabloids.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McDougal negotiated with the country\u2019s leading tabloid news provider, A.M.I., which is known to buy and bury stories that might damage allies of its chief executive, David J. Pecker \u2014 a practice known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d\n\nMs. McDougal\u2019s legal complaint alleges that she did not know about the practice, or about Mr. Pecker\u2019s friendship with Mr. Trump, when she began talking to company representatives, shortly after Mr. Trump locked up the Republican nomination.\n\nA.M.I. has previously acknowledged that Mr. Trump had been friends with Mr. Pecker, but said that he had never tried to influence coverage at the company\u2019s publications.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, A.M.I. said that its contract with Ms. McDougal was valid and that it looked forward \u201cto reaching an amicable resolution.\u201d It added that while she had given the company \u201ceditorial discretion to publish her life story,\u201d she had been \u201cfree to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016.\u201d\n\nA.M.I. amended her contract after the election, allowing her to answer \u201clegitimate\u201d questions from the press. But the lawsuit contends that the parameters were unclear to her, and her lawyers argue that A.M.I. can continue to control her responses.\n\nMs. McDougal has said that she was ambivalent about selling her story on the tabloid news market, but felt that her hand was forced after a hint of the alleged affair appeared in May 2016 on social media. Convinced something more would come out, she was determined to tell her story on her terms, her suit says.\n\nA mutual friend connected her to Mr. Davidson, who, she said, told her the story could be worth millions. He arranged an interview with Dylan Howard, A.M.I.\u2019s chief content officer, in Los Angeles. Mr. Davidson told her before the interview that A.M.I. would put $500,000 in an escrow account for her, and that \u201ca seven-figure publishing contract awaited her,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nMr. Howard spent several hours pressing Ms. McDougal on the details of her story.

This time, A.M.I. offered a different deal.\n\nMr. Davidson informed her that A.M.I. would buy her story but not publish it because of Mr. Pecker\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, the suit says. The payment would be $150,000, with Mr. Davidson and others involved on her behalf taking 45 percent. More alluring to Ms. McDougal, who is now a fitness specialist, was that the media company would feature her on its covers and in regular health and fitness columns, the complaint says.\n\nAs A.M.I. and Mr. Davidson pushed her to sign the deal on Aug. 5, Ms. McDougal expressed misgivings. But, her suit says, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard argued in an urgent Skype call that the deal to promote her would \u201ckick start and revitalize\u201d her career, given that she was \u201cold now.\u201d She was 45.\n\nIn all, they said, the contract would obligate A.M.I. to run more than 100 columns or articles and at least two covers featuring her. When she asked Mr. Davidson what she should do if her story leaked, he responded in an email, \u201cIF YOU DENY YOU ARE SAFE,\u201d and urged her to sign as soon as possible, according to the court documents.\n\nThe Times reported last month that Mr. Davidson sent Mr. Cohen an email on Aug. 5, 2016, asking him to call. Mr. Davidson then told Mr. Cohen over the phone that the deal had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe timeline provided in the lawsuit shows that Mr. Davidson\u2019s email came as he and A.M.I. were still hashing out the terms of the deal, which Ms. McDougal did not sign until the following day, Aug. 6. Mr. Cohen told The Times last month that he did not recall the communications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter signing the contract, Ms. McDougal grew frustrated when she did not hear about columns or cover shoots for several weeks.

Though the agreement explicitly mentioned \u201ca monthly column\u201d on aging and fitness for OK! and Star, and \u201cfour posts each month\u201d on Radar Online, it only gave A.M.I. \u201cthe right\u201d to print them.

Bryant\u2019s choice to make,\u201d said Brad White, Mr. Cochran\u2019s chief of staff and a veteran state operative. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to him to elect her.\u201d\n\nMr. Bryant is said to favor Ms. Hyde-Smith for reasons relating to both politics and personal affinity, viewing her as a rural populist in his own fashion. He has told allies he believes she would excite voters in a way that a more typical Republican officeholder in Jackson, the state capital, would not, and he views her deep connections in the farming communities as significant political assets.\n\nPresident Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had urged Mr. Bryant to appoint himself to the seat, specifically invoking the Alabama debacle. But Mr. Bryant had no appetite to go to Washington and neither did Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who is hoping to succeed the governor in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe governor then decided against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, who is 70 and would not be able to achieve the sort of longevity that Mississippi has come to expect in its senators.\n\nMr. Bryant was eager to fill the vacancy in part because Mr. McDaniel last week gave up his primary challenge against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent Republican up for re-election, to run for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. McDaniel has made his desire for the appointment clear, but the governor last week responded by saying he would not reward the 45-year-old state senator, who has become a thorn in the side of Mississippi\u2019s Republican establishment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,\u201d Mr. Bryant said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If no candidate garners a majority, the top two overall vote-getters will face off in a runoff later in November. What concerns some Republicans is that Mr. McDaniel\u2019s following on the right could, in a potentially crowded field, earn him a position in the runoff against a Democrat.\n\nAnd Mr. McDaniel, who has a history of making incendiary comments, would be more at risk of losing than a less-controversial Republican. What makes establishment-aligned Republicans even more nervous is the prospect that former Representative Mike Espy could emerge as the other candidate in the runoff.\n\nMississippi\u2019s first black congressman since reconstruction, Mr. Espy has deep ties to both Democrats and Republicans in the state.\n\nStill, if Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s partisan history could make her vulnerable on the right, it could conceivably appeal to moderate voters and even Democrats.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith, a cattle farmer, was first elected to the State Senate in 2000 and rose to become chair of the Agriculture Committee before winning her current office in 2011. But she voted in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, and Republicans who want to derail Mr. McDaniel worry that he will use that to link her to former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Bryant\u2019s decision to appoint her was first reported by the Clarion-Ledger of Mississippi.\n\nWhat could prove most problematic for Ms. Hyde-Smith is if additional Republicans enter the race, making it easier for Mr. McDaniel to emerge as the party\u2019s top vote-getter in the first balloting.

The tariffs go into effect on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of Nafta, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions.

Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on the coming China tariffs but said he made his concerns about the United States\u2019 access to the Asian nation\u2019s market known to his Chinese counterpart at the G-20.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having very direct discussions with China about reciprocal trade, discussed this morning about market reforms in China,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe look forward to them hopefully moving in that fashion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the G-20, concerns about rising trade barriers muted enthusiasm about the recent run of strong economic growth around the world.

Kasowitz, last summer, and was passed over by many of Washington\u2019s top lawyers before he settled on his current crop of attorneys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to see legal teams change dramatically and for competent lawyers to be replaced by others,\u201d said Roger Cossack, a longtime legal analyst. \u201cIt shows that there is chaos and that whoever the client is \u2014 in this case the president \u2014 is unhappy and is searching for the magic bullet.

Working inside the White House, Mr. Cobb oversaw the production of thousands of pages of documents and emails that were turned over to Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and said that the president should not assert executive privilege over the records to keep from slowing the process.

The lawyers see little upside.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow became concerned about their standing with the president in the past two weeks after they learned Mr. Trump had met with another veteran lawyer, Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings, about joining the team.\n\nBoth publicly and privately, Mr. Trump tried to reassure his lawyers that they had not fallen out of favor with him. \u201cI am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter, assailing a New York Times article about his discussions with Mr. Flood. \u201cThey are doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMr. Dowd, in turn, called on the Justice Department over the weekend to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked. But according to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president\u2019s urging.\n\nMr. Dowd\u2019s statement set off a stream of negative coverage of Mr. Trump on cable television, to which he is closely attuned. His lawyers were criticized for being undisciplined, and Mr. Dowd\u2019s remarks prompted concern that the president was going to order that Mr. Mueller be fired. Mr. Cobb tried to douse that speculation on Sunday, saying that the president was not considering dismissing the special counsel.\n\nThe president\u2019s newest lawyer, Mr. diGenova, has worked in Washington legal circles for decades, including as a United States attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Ronald Reagan.

She was very, very effective.\u201d\n\nTensions can run high at meetings of the Rules Committee, one of the original committees of the House and the forum where the majority party gets to exercise its muscle in setting the parameters of floor debate.\n\nWith its 9-to-4 membership breakdown, it is heavily weighted toward the majority, and the minority can often get angry and frustrated as majority lawmakers essentially fix the debate to their advantage. It often meets at odd hours and in rushed circumstances, exacerbating the partisan sniping. Both as chairwoman and the top member of the minority, Ms. Slaughter found ways to keep things on an even keel.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe was a force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk, fire and dynamic leadership to every meeting,\u201d said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, who now leads the panel and jousted with Ms. Slaughter for years. \u201cLouise was a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.\u201d He added that he would always \u201ccherish our friendship, camaraderie and, of course, her rhubarb pie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps Ms. Slaughter\u2019s biggest moment in the limelight was during House machinations over the health care bill in 2010. The loss of a crucial 60th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward M. Kennedy had handcuffed House Democrats who had no choice but to pass a Senate bill with some provisions they didn\u2019t like if they wanted to send a bill to the White House. To limit the political pain, Democrats cooked up an approach that would have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as a self-executing rule, allowing Democrats to avoid a direct vote on those objectionable provisions.\n\nThough Republicans had done the same thing in the past, they howled and mocked Ms. Slaughter with catchy phrases such as \u201cSlaughter House Rules.\u201d Democrats eventually came up with another approach, but Republicans continued to complain, leading the plain-spoken Ms. Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it\u2019s about blocking much-needed health care reform in this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who oppose the process don\u2019t want any debate or votes on health care itself. They just want to make reform go away.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, one of her top priorities was an ethics measure intended to prevent lawmakers and other federal officials from profiting in the stock market from inside knowledge.

Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.\n\nSenior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.\n\nWhether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,\u201d said Cynthia J.

Am\u00e9rico Alex Mata Garc\u00eda is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.\n\nThe four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.\n\nThe sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.\n\nOne Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.\n\nVenezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201d\n\nThe executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.\n\nRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.", "keywords": ["trump", "petro", "maduro", "white", "venezuelan", "currency", "sanctions", "venezuela", "officials", "united", "house", "bans", "expands", "venezuelas", "mr", "digital"], "polarity": 0.04665363046044865, "subjectivity": 0.348984774695002},

The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month.\n\n\u201cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings.

They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency.\n\nThough the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department\u2019s programs and resources.\n\nMs. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, \u201cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about \u201ca disconnect\u201d between Ms. DeVos\u2019s administration and his office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don\u2019t have staff that understand how the system works,\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen said. \u201cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills.\u201d\n\nThe plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the most part, Ms. DeVos\u2019s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services.\n\nDetails of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul.\n\nUnion officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors.\n\nThe union said the agreement came \u201cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,\u201d which concluded with the department\u2019s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started.\n\nThe department said that the union \u201cspent more than a year dragging its feet,\u201d and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers.\n\nThe department put its final offer in place.", "keywords": ["education", "staff", "bias", "school", "plan", "sand", "head", "democrats", "office", "department", "ms", "budget", "racial", "devos", "departments", "tell"], "polarity": 0.050771364438031104, "subjectivity": 0.42803711720378373},

(Mr. Graham issued a similar warning during an interview with the radio host Hugh Hewitt.)\n\nRepublican leaders including Mr. McConnell, Mr. Flake said, should \u201cstand up and forcefully say, \u2018This will not stand.\u2019\u201d\n\nConfrontation is not Mr. McConnell\u2019s style.

Bush on domestic policy, that is not good enough.\n\nMr. McConnell and other Republican leaders must \u201cmake it clear to Trump and the White House that if he fires Mueller, that is crossing a red line, and there will be consequences,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. One idea: Warn the president that Congress will hire Mr. Mueller to continue his inquiry if Mr. Trump fires him.\n\n\u201cI understand that this is not McConnell\u2019s thing to speak out and challenge people publicly, and maybe he is being extremely effective privately \u2014 and if he is, more power to him,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, what\u2019s said publicly matters, too. And at some point, if what Trump says and does is met with silence, it implies complicity for the party.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell learned the dangers of criticizing Mr. Trump in August, when he was asked in Kentucky about the Senate\u2019s struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Defending the chamber\u2019s work, Mr. McConnell offered an offhand assessment of how the president appeared to be learning on the job, saying Mr. Trump \u201chad excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nIt was hardly inflammatory, but the comment infuriated Mr. Trump, who responded with a Twitter tirade against the leader that lasted six weeks. The two did not speak for a long stretch during that period, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where Mr. McConnell privately expressed doubts that Mr. Trump could salvage his presidency.\n\nIn October, as suddenly as it began, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack ended. In an orchestrated show of togetherness, he brought Mr. McConnell into the Rose Garden to declare that the two were \u201ccloser than ever before.\u201d One person close to Mr. McConnell says he does not want a repeat of what followed the \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d remark.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat caused him six weeks of unrelenting pain of Trump whacking him,\u201d that person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Mr. McConnell\u2019s thinking. \u201cI think at that moment, McConnell learned a lesson: There\u2019s nothing to be gained by commenting on his comments because it doesn\u2019t change his behavior.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell has always been a man of few words, and one who chooses his words carefully. Unlike other senators who linger in the Capitol corridors to talk with reporters, he shuns hallway interviews and rarely takes more than a few questions at his Tuesday briefings. His reticence is integral to his leadership style.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why he\u2019s a pretty effective leader \u2014 it\u2019s because he economizes words,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff for Mr. McConnell who remains close to him. \u201cWhen he speaks, it generally means something.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell also makes it a point not to speak out on an issue unless his position has changed. He said in November, and then again in January, that he saw no need for legislation to protect the special counsel; when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets over the weekend, his advisers simply cited those statements.\n\nAnd the leader routinely advises his conference that it is more effective to deal with concerns internally than debate them through the news media.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, \u201che probably communicates it directly and doesn\u2019t feel the need to pontificate in public.\u201d", "keywords": ["trump", "leader", "words", "tiptoes", "counsel", "issue", "twitter", "president", "mueller", "man", "trumps", "mcconnell", "special", "mr"], "polarity": 0.1391327294105072, "subjectivity": 0.4378988295654962},

The memoir, scheduled to be released on April 17, has been advertised as a frank account of Mr. Comey\u2019s \u201cnever-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career.\u201d\n\nMr. Oliver\u2019s book is very different than that.\n\nIn it, Marlon Bundo, a snappily dressed bunny with a penchant for bright bow ties, falls in love with a bespectacled boy bunny named Wesley.

Mr. Oliver said all of his book\u2019s profits would be donated to The Trevor Project, a charity for L.G.B.T. youth, and AIDS United.\n\nThat was a pointed jab at Mr. Pence, who is a longtime opponent of L.G.B.T. rights, which he opposed as both governor of Indiana and a member of Congress.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pence described James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, which teaches that people can vanquish same-sex attraction if they \u201ccooperate with God in the process of becoming more like Jesus,\u201d as \u201ca friend and a mentor.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence has also long been dogged by claims that he supports anti-gay conversion therapy due in part to language contained on the website of his 2000 campaign for Congress.

But the document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for review and declassification before it can be released publicly, which could take weeks or months.\n\nMore than a year into its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling, the Intelligence Committee has thus far offered little visibility into its work. Witnesses have come and gone in relative secret.

Whether the increased scrutiny that comes with being the only remaining investigation on Capitol Hill will change that remains unclear.\n\nIn a show of bipartisan resolve, nearly every member of the committee took part in Tuesday\u2019s announcement and those who spoke endorsed the committee\u2019s findings.\n\nThe committee\u2019s leaders had last updated the public on the investigation in October, when they said that a review had broadly confirmed the conclusions of American spy agencies that President Vladimir V.

And both women\u2019s suits could provide more fodder for federal complaints from the watchdog group Common Cause that the payoffs were, effectively, illegal campaign contributions.\n\nMs. Clifford and Ms. McDougal tell strikingly similar stories about their experiences with Mr. Trump, which included alleged trysts at the same Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006, dates at the same Beverly Hills hotel and promises of apartments as gifts. Their stories first surfaced in the The Wall Street Journal four days before the election, but got little traction in the swirl of news that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The women even shared the same Los Angeles lawyer, Keith Davidson, who has long worked for clients who sell their stories to the tabloids.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McDougal negotiated with the country\u2019s leading tabloid news provider, A.M.I., which is known to buy and bury stories that might damage allies of its chief executive, David J. Pecker \u2014 a practice known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d\n\nMs. McDougal\u2019s legal complaint alleges that she did not know about the practice, or about Mr. Pecker\u2019s friendship with Mr. Trump, when she began talking to company representatives, shortly after Mr. Trump locked up the Republican nomination.\n\nA.M.I. has previously acknowledged that Mr. Trump had been friends with Mr. Pecker, but said that he had never tried to influence coverage at the company\u2019s publications.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, A.M.I. said that its contract with Ms. McDougal was valid and that it looked forward \u201cto reaching an amicable resolution.\u201d It added that while she had given the company \u201ceditorial discretion to publish her life story,\u201d she had been \u201cfree to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016.\u201d\n\nA.M.I. amended her contract after the election, allowing her to answer \u201clegitimate\u201d questions from the press. But the lawsuit contends that the parameters were unclear to her, and her lawyers argue that A.M.I. can continue to control her responses.\n\nMs. McDougal has said that she was ambivalent about selling her story on the tabloid news market, but felt that her hand was forced after a hint of the alleged affair appeared in May 2016 on social media. Convinced something more would come out, she was determined to tell her story on her terms, her suit says.\n\nA mutual friend connected her to Mr. Davidson, who, she said, told her the story could be worth millions. He arranged an interview with Dylan Howard, A.M.I.\u2019s chief content officer, in Los Angeles. Mr. Davidson told her before the interview that A.M.I. would put $500,000 in an escrow account for her, and that \u201ca seven-figure publishing contract awaited her,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nMr. Howard spent several hours pressing Ms. McDougal on the details of her story. But several days later, the media company declined to buy it, the complaint reads, and \u201cMr. Davidson revealed that, in fact, there was no money in escrow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Davidson said on Tuesday that the lawyer \u201cfulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal to accomplish her stated goals at that time,\u201d but that commenting further would \u201cviolate attorney-client privilege.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

This time, A.M.I. offered a different deal.\n\nMr. Davidson informed her that A.M.I. would buy her story but not publish it because of Mr. Pecker\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, the suit says. The payment would be $150,000, with Mr. Davidson and others involved on her behalf taking 45 percent. More alluring to Ms. McDougal, who is now a fitness specialist, was that the media company would feature her on its covers and in regular health and fitness columns, the complaint says.\n\nAs A.M.I. and Mr. Davidson pushed her to sign the deal on Aug. 5, Ms. McDougal expressed misgivings. But, her suit says, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard argued in an urgent Skype call that the deal to promote her would \u201ckick start and revitalize\u201d her career, given that she was \u201cold now.\u201d She was 45.\n\nIn all, they said, the contract would obligate A.M.I. to run more than 100 columns or articles and at least two covers featuring her. When she asked Mr. Davidson what she should do if her story leaked, he responded in an email, \u201cIF YOU DENY YOU ARE SAFE,\u201d and urged her to sign as soon as possible, according to the court documents.\n\nThe Times reported last month that Mr. Davidson sent Mr. Cohen an email on Aug. 5, 2016, asking him to call. Mr. Davidson then told Mr. Cohen over the phone that the deal had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe timeline provided in the lawsuit shows that Mr. Davidson\u2019s email came as he and A.M.I. were still hashing out the terms of the deal, which Ms. McDougal did not sign until the following day, Aug. 6. Mr. Cohen told The Times last month that he did not recall the communications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter signing the contract, Ms. McDougal grew frustrated when she did not hear about columns or cover shoots for several weeks. She later figured out why. Though the agreement explicitly mentioned \u201ca monthly column\u201d on aging and fitness for OK! and Star, and \u201cfour posts each month\u201d on Radar Online, it only gave A.M.I. \u201cthe right\u201d to print them. It was not an obligation.\n\n\u201cShe was tricked into signing it while being misled as to its contents (including by her own lawyer, on whose advice she was entitled to rely),\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nSo far, A.M.I. has run one cover and roughly two dozen columns or posts featuring her. The company said that it had been trying to schedule a photo shoot for another cover but implied that Ms. McDougal felt she had not been paid enough.\n\nHer legal team denied that she was seeking more money.\n\nMr. Stris contends that his client was misled and that the contract was executed under fraudulent circumstances, giving her the right to sue in court rather than proceed in arbitration.", "keywords": ["trump", "model", "mcdougal", "affair", "company", "karen", "sign", "speak", "sues", "ms", "davidson", "contract", "alleged", "times", "ami", "mr", "explayboy"], "polarity": 0.07714522067970343, "subjectivity": 0.35028084941878035},

She said it showed what appeared to be a nurse in front of an ultrasound device, mentioned abortion and indicated that the center complied with medical privacy laws.\n\n\u201cIf a reasonable person could look at this website and think that you\u2019re giving medical advice,\u201d she asked, \u201cwould the unlicensed notice be wrong?\u201d\n\nMr. Farris said unlicensed centers do not provide medical services but only advice about pregnancy.\n\nJustice Kennedy was critical of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s outside research. \u201cIn this case,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t go beyond the record to look on the internet because I don\u2019t think we should do that.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch said the state could address misleading speech more directly, through lawsuits and prosecutions.

He has told allies he believes she would excite voters in a way that a more typical Republican officeholder in Jackson, the state capital, would not, and he views her deep connections in the farming communities as significant political assets.\n\nPresident Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had urged Mr. Bryant to appoint himself to the seat, specifically invoking the Alabama debacle. But Mr. Bryant had no appetite to go to Washington and neither did Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who is hoping to succeed the governor in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe governor then decided against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, who is 70 and would not be able to achieve the sort of longevity that Mississippi has come to expect in its senators.\n\nMr. Bryant was eager to fill the vacancy in part because Mr. McDaniel last week gave up his primary challenge against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent Republican up for re-election, to run for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. McDaniel has made his desire for the appointment clear, but the governor last week responded by saying he would not reward the 45-year-old state senator, who has become a thorn in the side of Mississippi\u2019s Republican establishment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,\u201d Mr. Bryant said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If no candidate garners a majority, the top two overall vote-getters will face off in a runoff later in November. What concerns some Republicans is that Mr. McDaniel\u2019s following on the right could, in a potentially crowded field, earn him a position in the runoff against a Democrat.\n\nAnd Mr. McDaniel, who has a history of making incendiary comments, would be more at risk of losing than a less-controversial Republican. What makes establishment-aligned Republicans even more nervous is the prospect that former Representative Mike Espy could emerge as the other candidate in the runoff.\n\nMississippi\u2019s first black congressman since reconstruction, Mr. Espy has deep ties to both Democrats and Republicans in the state.\n\nStill, if Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s partisan history could make her vulnerable on the right, it could conceivably appeal to moderate voters and even Democrats.\n\nMs. Hyde-Smith, a cattle farmer, was first elected to the State Senate in 2000 and rose to become chair of the Agriculture Committee before winning her current office in 2011. But she voted in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, and Republicans who want to derail Mr. McDaniel worry that he will use that to link her to former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Bryant\u2019s decision to appoint her was first reported by the Clarion-Ledger of Mississippi.\n\nWhat could prove most problematic for Ms. Hyde-Smith is if additional Republicans enter the race, making it easier for Mr. McDaniel to emerge as the party\u2019s top vote-getter in the first balloting.

Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of Nafta, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions.

Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on the coming China tariffs but said he made his concerns about the United States\u2019 access to the Asian nation\u2019s market known to his Chinese counterpart at the G-20.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having very direct discussions with China about reciprocal trade, discussed this morning about market reforms in China,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe look forward to them hopefully moving in that fashion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the G-20, concerns about rising trade barriers muted enthusiasm about the recent run of strong economic growth around the world. The International Monetary Fund listed in a report prepared before the meetings that \u201cinward-looking policies\u201d could pose a risk to the global economy. Timothy D. Adams, the president of the Institute of International Finance, warned that a trend toward \u201cde-globalization\u201d could harm consumers.\n\n\u201cProtectionism is creeping and seeping in all corners of the economy,\u201d Mr. Adams said.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda is provoking consternation among veterans of previous administrations, who lament the United States\u2019 abdication as a vocal promoter of the gains from free and open markets.\n\n\u201cWe worked very hard to drive the agenda toward having open markets, free trade, inclusive growth and not interfering in currency in an unfair way,\u201d Jack Lew, who served as Treasury secretary under Mr. Obama, said in an interview this month. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s where the U.S. is pressing the G-20 to go right now. It doesn\u2019t seem to be.\u201d\n\nDesmond Lachman, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy director for policy at the International Monetary Fund, said it was remarkable to see the United States adopting an isolationist policy.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans are furious with what the U.S. is doing,\u201d Mr. Lachman said. \u201cFor 70 years, the United States has been the leader in the call for open markets and global markets. Now they are in the opposite position.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Mr. Trump, however, have cheered Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach to China on steel and intellectual property.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit rambunctious for the Trump administration to approach the issue this way, but it\u2019s certainly more effective than continuing the polite conversations that have been avoiding the real challenges for some time now,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.

The growing affluence and educational attainment of white Democrats might give them a much better chance of earning a turnout advantage than in the past.\n\nBut so far, Democrats have not been able to sustain the same advantage in higher-turnout elections, such as in the general elections in New Jersey and Virginia, or in the special congressional election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats still appeared to have a turnout advantage compared with all registered voters, but not a big one. The Republicans had an advantage in the Georgia Sixth runoff election between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel, the highest-profile race of all. And while Democrats fared well over all in these elections, the party\u2019s showing was not especially impressive compared with what they have often pulled off in lower-turnout elections.\n\nThe relatively unimpressive Democratic performance in Virginia and New Jersey is particularly noteworthy: The two elections are usually entirely omitted from analysis of recent races, even though more votes were cast in those two elections than in all of the special elections combined.\n\nThe Democrats could still fare extremely well even if their turnout advantage is diminished. Indeed, they did well in the special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District and in the Alabama Senate race. Turnout was quite high for both sides in the two races. On the other hand, one could argue that these races aren\u2019t an easily replicable model for Democratic success.\n\nThere isn\u2019t enough data to definitively resolve this question.

We\u2019re not just not addressing it, we\u2019re adding to it.\u201d\n\nInvestors may be starting to worry about whether the recovery could be, if not ending, at least entering a riskier phase. In February, markets tumbled after a report showing unexpectedly strong wage growth revived long-dormant fears of inflation. The markets rebounded but have remained volatile, dropping again this month when Mr. Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum that are expected to take effect this week.\n\nEconomists said that any fears investors had would not be unfounded, but might be premature. It is possible that the tightening labor market \u2014 the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000 \u2014 could force companies to pay higher wages. That could lead to inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly than planned, and the tighter credit for businesses and consumers could cause a recession.\n\nThe likelihood of such a chain of events may have increased in recent months with the Republican tax bill\u2019s passage and the adoption of a big spending package in Congress, which together could pour hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus into the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could also increase consumer prices by limiting cheaper imports from abroad.\n\n\u201cWe already had a tight economy, and then you add fiscal stimulus, and then you add on top of that trade protections,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s close to the perfect storm coming together with these risks of overheating.\u201d\n\nSo far, the threat remains hypothetical. Inflation has crept up but remains below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, and wage growth remains anemic \u2014 even the surprising figure for January was later revised down. If inflation does pick up, it will not result in a recession overnight.\n\nThe impact of a potential trade war is harder to assess. The tariffs announced by Mr. Trump so far are small and unlikely to have much effect on the overall economy. But if he pursues broad-based tariffs against China \u2014 something he is reportedly considering \u2014 and prompts retaliation by the European Union or other trading partners, the consequences could be much greater.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe know from history that\u2019s lose-lose,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank. \u201cIt reverberates throughout the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nBeyond the issue of trade, most experts see few threats likely to derail the recovery in the short term. That is partly because it would take a fairly substantial shock to knock the economy off course. Tax cuts and spending increases may raise the specter of inflation, but they also provide extra insulation against such a shock. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 14 percent.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to go gangbusters for the rest of this year,\u201d said Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And although the current expansion has been durable, it has not been particularly strong. Quarterly annualized growth in gross domestic product has averaged just 2.2 percent since the recession ended, compared with 5 percent for the typical recovery since 1950. The economy has basically experienced a long smolder rather than the kind of rapid conflagration common in the past.\n\n\u201cYou can look at it with time as your metric and say, \u2018Wow, this is really long,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. \u201cOr you can look at output and say, \u2018It\u2019s actually surprisingly weak.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome parts of the country have experienced little recovery at all. And many families are still earning far less than they were before the recession. As a result, some economists, especially on the left, argue that policymakers should be less worried about the economy overheating than about the recovery ending too soon.\n\n\u201cYou just see a pervasive attitude in markets that says, \u2018Oh, no, workers are starting to get a piece of the pie, time to take it away,\u2019\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nLawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, said there was evidence that the economy could keep growing without faster inflation. Even a little more inflation, Mr. Summers said, would not necessarily be a bad thing.\n\n\u201cA strong, fully employed economy \u2014 where firms looking for workers is a larger issue than workers looking for firms \u2014 is the best social program we know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is shortages of labor that induce firms to figure out how to train felons, to move beyond their traditional prejudices, to figure out how to skill unskilled workers, to reach into distressed or depressed communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat argument puts economists like Mr. Summers and Mr. Bernstein in odd political company. Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers \u2014 including the incoming head of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow \u2014 have played down the threat of inflation, and Mr. Trump has indicated in the past that he would like the Fed to keep interest rates low. That could pay electoral dividends: If the Fed allows the economy to accelerate, it could bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances, even if it raises the risk of a recession in his second term.\n\nSo far, the Fed does not seem inclined to cooperate. Jerome H. Powell, the newly appointed Fed chairman, has said he plans to continue the policy of gradual rate increases adopted by his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But Mr. Powell hinted in recent congressional testimony that the central bank could be forced to move more quickly if the economy continued to gain strength.\n\n\u201cSome of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,\u201d Mr. Powell told lawmakers last month.\n\nIn any case, research has found that economic expansions do not \u201cdie of old age.\u201d Rather, they end because something \u2014 a policy mistake, an asset bubble, an outside shock \u2014 causes them to.\n\nNellie Liang, who led the Fed\u2019s financial stability efforts after the financial crisis, said the United States had stayed out of trouble since then partly because regulators learned lessons that made banks and other financial institutions far stronger.\n\nBut Ms. Liang said that after years of low interest rates and steady gains, investors could be caught off guard when the economy hits a speed bump.\n\n\u201cRecessions don\u2019t have to come every 10 years or so,\u201d Ms. Liang said.

He added, \u201cMake no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\u201d\n\nLittle evidence has emerged to support that theory.\n\nMr. Trump is also discussing adding other lawyers to the team, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe tumult marked the greatest instability on the team since Mr. Trump pushed aside his personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, last summer, and was passed over by many of Washington\u2019s top lawyers before he settled on his current crop of attorneys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to see legal teams change dramatically and for competent lawyers to be replaced by others,\u201d said Roger Cossack, a longtime legal analyst. \u201cIt shows that there is chaos and that whoever the client is \u2014 in this case the president \u2014 is unhappy and is searching for the magic bullet.

The president clearly wants it to end and wants to put an end to it.\u201d\n\nMr. Cobb, Mr. Dowd and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, took over last summer from Mr. Kasowitz, a feisty New Yorker who had represented Mr. Trump in high-profile lawsuits and urged an aggressive posture toward Mr. Mueller, who was appointed last May.\n\nMr. Trump insisted to his lawyers that he did nothing wrong and they pushed for cooperation with the special counsel, arguing it was his best way to have his name cleared. Working inside the White House, Mr. Cobb oversaw the production of thousands of pages of documents and emails that were turned over to Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and said that the president should not assert executive privilege over the records to keep from slowing the process. The lawyers told the president they hoped to get Mr. Mueller to acknowledge by the end of the year that Mr. Trump was not a target of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is continuing.\n\nAs it goes forward, Mr. Trump has questioned his lawyers\u2019 approach and clashed with them about whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller. The president believes he is his best spokesman and can explain to Mr. Mueller that he did nothing wrong. The lawyers see little upside.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow became concerned about their standing with the president in the past two weeks after they learned Mr. Trump had met with another veteran lawyer, Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings, about joining the team.\n\nBoth publicly and privately, Mr. Trump tried to reassure his lawyers that they had not fallen out of favor with him. \u201cI am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter, assailing a New York Times article about his discussions with Mr. Flood. \u201cThey are doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMr. Dowd, in turn, called on the Justice Department over the weekend to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked. But according to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president\u2019s urging.\n\nMr. Dowd\u2019s statement set off a stream of negative coverage of Mr. Trump on cable television, to which he is closely attuned. His lawyers were criticized for being undisciplined, and Mr. Dowd\u2019s remarks prompted concern that the president was going to order that Mr. Mueller be fired. Mr. Cobb tried to douse that speculation on Sunday, saying that the president was not considering dismissing the special counsel.\n\nThe president\u2019s newest lawyer, Mr. diGenova, has worked in Washington legal circles for decades, including as a United States attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Ronald Reagan. He has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate.\n\nMr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. She has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince also attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.\n\nMs. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president\u2019s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.\n\nMr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role be narrowed.

The loss of a crucial 60th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward M. Kennedy had handcuffed House Democrats who had no choice but to pass a Senate bill with some provisions they didn\u2019t like if they wanted to send a bill to the White House. To limit the political pain, Democrats cooked up an approach that would have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as a self-executing rule, allowing Democrats to avoid a direct vote on those objectionable provisions.\n\nThough Republicans had done the same thing in the past, they howled and mocked Ms. Slaughter with catchy phrases such as \u201cSlaughter House Rules.\u201d Democrats eventually came up with another approach, but Republicans continued to complain, leading the plain-spoken Ms. Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it\u2019s about blocking much-needed health care reform in this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who oppose the process don\u2019t want any debate or votes on health care itself.

Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency.

Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.\n\nOne Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.\n\nVenezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201d\n\nThe executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.\n\nRisa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela \u2014 the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s grandiose claims, she said \u2014 the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic,\u201d Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday\u2019s measures. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,\u201d both in Venezuela and in the United States.", "keywords": ["trump", "petro", "maduro", "white", "venezuelan", "currency", "sanctions", "venezuela", "officials", "united", "house", "bans", "expands", "venezuelas", "mr", "digital"], "polarity": 0.04665363046044865, "subjectivity": 0.348984774695002},

The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "guidance", "discipline", "minnesota", "punished", "school", "york", "students", "ms", "quandary", "teachers", "districts", "national", "white", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

The Times identified these cases \u2014 many of which are sealed \u2014 through interviews with lawyers, police officers and current and former judges.\n\n[ALSO READ: He Excelled as a Detective, Until Prosecutors Stopped Believing Him]\n\nIn these cases, officers have lied about the whereabouts of guns, putting them in suspects\u2019 hands or waistbands when they were actually hidden out of sight. They have barged into apartments and conducted searches, only to testify otherwise later. Under oath, they have given firsthand accounts of crimes or arrests that they did not in fact witness. They have falsely claimed to have watched drug deals happen, only to later recant or be shown to have lied.\n\nNo detail, seemingly, is too minor to embellish. \u201cClenched fists\u201d is how one Brooklyn officer described the hands of a man he claimed had angrily approached him and started screaming and yelling \u2014 an encounter that prosecutors later determined never occurred. Another officer, during a Bronx trial, accused a driver of recklessly crossing the double-yellow line \u2014 on a stretch of road that had no double-yellow line.\n\nIn many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people \u2014 who may or may not have committed a crime \u2014 with trumped-up evidence.\n\nIn still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object \u2014 later identified as a gun \u2014 and threw it on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cP.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,\u201d according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office wrote summarizing her testimony.\n\nBut prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\n\nPolice lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail \u2014 and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges\u2019 efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cWe have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest municipal force. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.\u201d\n\nShrouded, but Persistent\n\nThe 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That\u2019s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court \u2014 and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case \u2014 the proceedings are often sealed afterward.\n\nStill, the cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading.\n\nSo far in 2018, a Queens detective has been convicted of lying in a drug case and a Brooklyn detective has been arrested amid accusations that he fabricated the results of a photo lineup. These cases returned the phenomenon of police lying to the public eye, leaving police officials to defend the integrity of honest officers.\n\nKevin Richardson, the Police Department\u2019s top internal prosecutor, said he believed so-called testilying was nearing its end. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s very much largely on its way out,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s tempting to think about police lying as a bygone of past eras: a form of misconduct that ran unchecked as soaring street violence left the police overwhelmed during the 1980s and early 1990s and that re-emerged as police embraced stop-and-frisk tactics and covered up constitutional violations with lies.\n\nBut false testimony by the police persists even as crime has drastically receded across the city and as the Police Department has renounced the excesses of the stop-and-frisk years.\n\nSome policing experts anticipate that the ubiquity of cameras \u2014 whether on cellphones, affixed to buildings or worn by officers \u2014 will greatly reduce police lying. For the moment, however, video seems more capable of exposing lies than vanquishing them.\n\nMemory and Manipulation\n\nIn two recent cases, The Times found, officers appear to have given false accounts about witness identifications. These cases are particularly troubling because erroneous identifications by witnesses have been a leading cause of wrongful convictions.\n\nAfter a 2016 mugging near a Brooklyn subway station, the police arrested a group of four people, one of whom was found to be in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet. In preparing the case, prosecutors sought to pin down a few basic facts. Had the police brought the victim, who was punched and had his wallet taken, to positively identify the four suspects after they were taken into custody? If so, what had the victim said?\n\nGetting a straight answer from the arresting officer, Chedanan Naurang, proved nearly impossible. It had been Officer Naurang\u2019s quick thinking that had made the arrest possible: Having lost the suspects at one subway station, he followed a hunch and drove one stop down the line, where he caught up with the four men after they got off the train.\n\nBut certain details Officer Naurang gave prosecutors kept shifting over the next year, according to a February 2017 letter that prosecutors wrote in which they summarized his fluid story.\n\nOfficer Naurang said at one point that the identification had occurred inside a police station when the victim passed by the holding cells, saw the men and confirmed their involvement in the crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Two NYPD Officers Are Charged With Lying About Suspect]\n\nA few weeks later, he backtracked. No, the victim had actually never gotten to see the suspects at the police station, Officer Naurang explained. Instead, the victim had gotten a chance to view them on the street, shortly after their arrest. That\u2019s when the victim got out of the police vehicle in which he had been waiting, Officer Naurang said, and pointed to one of the four men, identifying him as an attacker.\n\nThis version of events, however, was at odds with the recollection of the police officer who had driven the victim to the scene of the arrest. That officer, Christopher McDonald, told prosecutors that the victim had remained in the back seat while viewing the four suspects. And Officer McDonald said that the victim couldn\u2019t say whether they were his assailants. He thought he recognized their clothing, but wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nBecause of Officer Naurang\u2019s changing story, prosecutors dropped the case against the men as part of a deal in which all four pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a second mugging they were accused of the same night.", "keywords": ["later", "problem", "testilying", "officer", "officers", "stubborn", "cases", "prosecutors", "suspects", "naurang", "lying", "times", "victim"], "polarity": 0.01095650381364667, "subjectivity": 0.37745734657499336},

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations. The president\u2019s moral framework springs from an American tradition of cultivating fear and contempt among its white citizens against immigrants, indigenous people and people of color, who are placed on the other side of \u201cthe law.\u201d It\u2019s a practice that has taken on new strength at a time when many white people fear they may be outnumbered, outvoted and out of time.\n\nThis is the opposite of what we like to tell ourselves is the traditional American civic creed: one symbolized by a blindfolded Lady Justice who applies the law without fear or favor to whoever may come before her. It is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most insidious victories that he has given his supporters permission to drop any pretense of insisting that their actions and views should conform to this principle.\n\nIf all that matters when it comes to \u201claw and order\u201d is who is a friend and who is an enemy, and if friends are white and enemies are black or Latino or in the wrong party, then the rhetoric around crime and punishment stops being about justice and is merely about power and corruption.\n\nAnd this is what \u201claw and order\u201d means: the preservation of a certain social order, not the rule of law. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long to see what has always been staring us in the face. After all, the last president to focus so intensely on law and order, Richard Nixon, the man who helped usher in mass incarceration, was also the most infamous criminal to occupy the Oval Office. The history of the United States is the story of a struggle between the desire to establish certain universal rights and the countervailing desire to preserve a particular social order.\n\nWe are now witnessing a president who wholly embraces the latter. America can have that kind of social order, or it can have justice for all.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/california-marijuana-oakland-compton.html", "text": "Several states, including Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are drawing up or have provisions in their marijuana laws to assist communities disproportionately affected by drug interdiction efforts.\n\nIn California, Oakland led the way in framing the legalization as both an opportunity to address past injustice and as a source of revenue. Yet dozens of other cities and towns across the state \u2014 including Bakersfield, Brentwood, Chico, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Mill Valley and Palo Alto \u2014 want nothing to do with recreational marijuana sales.\n\nOnly 14 percent of California\u2019s 482 cities and towns allow retail sales of recreational marijuana, according to Weedmaps, a website that hosts reviews of cannabis businesses. Californians may want access to a marijuana dispensary, just not necessarily down the block from them.\n\nWhen legalization came into effect in California in January, Oakland started a program that offered licenses to those with previous marijuana arrests. The idea, which has been copied in cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, was intended as a sort of redress for the years before legalization when blacks and other nonwhites were arrested at rates that were disproportionate to their share of the population.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs was a very specific war on a very specific community and culture,\u201d said Darlene Flynn, the director of Oakland\u2019s Department of Race and Equity.\n\nOakland\u2019s equity program goes to the heart of a paradox of legal marijuana sales in California: While large numbers of those arrested before legalization were black, most of the cannabis businesses in the post-legalization era are run by white men.\n\nLast year, Oakland produced a report showing that 77 percent of cannabis-related arrests in 2015 were of African-Americans, who make up around 30 percent of the city\u2019s 420,000 residents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of data that demonstrates that white people use and distribute drugs at the same rate as minorities do,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThere was an extreme tilt with regards to arrests and convictions.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those with marijuana convictions, Oakland\u2019s program is open to people who lived in neighborhoods that had a particularly heavy police presence during the decades of marijuana prohibition.\n\nLike Oakland, Compton has a history of police abuse and high crime rates. In 2012, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department experimented with an aircraft that recorded high-definition images of the city, which allowed it to track everything happening on the streets. The experiment was kept secret from the city\u2019s residents until it was revealed two years later, to much outrage.\n\nBut both cities have had rising fortunes in recent years. Crime has fallen and economic prospects have brightened. The median price of a home in Compton is now $384,000, a 75 percent increase from five years ago, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The rise has been even more dramatic in Oakland: prices have doubled in five years, to a median of $746,100.\n\nYet when the question of marijuana legalization came to Compton, residents responded with a completely different answer from Oakland.\n\nCivic and church groups in Compton banded together to campaign door-to-door against two ballot measures that would have allowed marijuana dispensaries and other cannabis manufacturing businesses.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard trying to change the image of Compton,\u201d said the Rev. Stanley W. Prince, a leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign that was victorious in the January vote. \u201cThere is an economy that can be developed without having weed as the main product.\u201d\n\nYoung people in Compton have a much smaller margin of error than people in wealthier places, Mr. Prince said. They could easily be denied jobs or be fired from them because of marijuana use.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are trying to show that it will not work in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late January, a decisive 76 percent of voters in Compton rejected the proposals that would have allowed marijuana businesses.\n\nCompton\u2019s city manager, Cecil W. Rhambo Jr., said the vote underlined the strength of underestimated conservative views on marijuana in the city, which has a population of just under 100,000.\n\nMr. Rhambo said the vote showed that the \u201ccity portrayed in rap videos is different from the values of the older people who live here, the high propensity voters.\u201d\n\nCompton still struggles with violence \u2014 there were 27 murders in 2017. But that is a fraction of the numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLongtime Compton residents, especially those who live in parts of town with neat rows of ranch houses and citrus trees, emphasize a sense of community and the household names who grew up in the city, among them the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, the actor Kevin Costner, and the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle. (The Williams sisters returned to Compton 16 months ago for a ceremony that dedicated a set of municipal tennis courts in their name.)\n\n\u201cIt was just an idyllic place to grow up,\u201d said James Hays, 61, the owner of a medical technology company who moved to Compton as a child in 1961. \u201cYou had nice single-family homes and manicured lawns, clean streets.\u201d\n\nLike many others in the no campaign, Mr. Hays blames the town\u2019s deterioration on drugs, including marijuana.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

In a TV commercial, he declared, \u201cI think welfare is demeaning and destructive of the human being and of his family.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for cheating the system, as Ronald Reagan later would, but said he envisioned a policy of full employment in which a person could say to himself: \u201cI helped build this country. I am a participant in its greatest public venture.\u201d\n\nOn issues of national security, Kennedy took a principled position in opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 whose very morality he questioned \u2014 but threaded the needle in a way that also made clear to working-class voters that he differed sharply from upper-middle-class white college students who avoided service or even sympathized with the North Vietnamese Communists. At Notre Dame, Kennedy was booed for saying college draft deferments should be abolished. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the unfair advantage while poor people are being drafted,\u201d he said. Remarkably, in Indiana he polled as well among those who favored Johnson\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War as he did among those who opposed it.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign to woo working-class voters across racial lines worked. The candidate most identified with advancing civil rights did well not only with black and Hispanic voters but also among working-class whites, some of whom had supported Wallace\u2019s segregationist candidacy in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA half-century later, how could progressives try to rebuild the Bobby Kennedy coalition? Kennedy\u2019s appeal was based in part on being the brother of a revered and martyred president, of course, and the most salient issues were different in 1968 than they are today. But Kennedy stressed fundamental themes that travel across time and transcend specific policy issues.\n\nFirst, to appeal to a sizable number of white working-class voters in 1968, Kennedy did not forfeit his basic principles or change his positions on civil rights, or war and peace \u2014 and neither should progressives today. Ignoring the rights of women, gay people and people of color is both morally wrong and politically stupid if your aspiration is an inclusive populism.\n\nSecond, progressives should fight for economic justice in a manner that is relentless rather than episodic. On the campaign trail, Kennedy consistently hit themes of economic inequality and named the names of wealthy individuals, like the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who paid little in taxes. By contrast, in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized economic issues in favor of attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s qualifications, according to research by Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute, and his support among white non-college voters rose considerably. Progressives also need to vigorously punish Wall Street malfeasance. It is difficult to imagine that Kennedy, a tough prosecutor, would have argued, as some members of the Obama administration did, that some companies are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nThird, progressives should explicitly signal the inclusion of working-class whites in their vision for change by applying civil rights laws to issues of class inequality, consistent with Kennedy\u2019s view that \u201cpoverty is closer to the root of the problem than color.\u201d I have long argued that we should extend the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers of all races engaged in labor organizing; integrate elementary and secondary schools not only by race but also by socioeconomic status; combat discrimination in housing by economic status as well as race; and adopt affirmative action programs in higher education for economically disadvantaged students of every color.\n\nFourth, progressives could adopt policies that respect the values of working-class people under the banner of patriotic populism, as Kennedy did. They should unapologetically champion a strong American identity around the shared values espoused in the Declaration of Independence as an antidote to exclusionary white nationalism.\n\nAn inclusive patriotic populism would be much more racially tolerant than Mr. Trump\u2019s white nationalism, and it would be tougher on national and domestic security than the populism offered by Mr. Sanders. If Robert Kennedy, the civil rights champion, could attract Wallace voters at a time of national chaos, surely the right progressive candidate with the right message could bring a significant portion of the Obama-Trump voters back home. Doing so would not only bring electoral success but also make it easier to forge a more economically progressive public policy to address America\u2019s dangerous economic divide.", "keywords": ["war", "bobby", "whites", "workingclass", "rights", "kennedy", "civil", "economic", "progressives", "white", "voters", "pathway"], "polarity": 0.1222115912602638, "subjectivity": 0.4557301204203861},

It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos.

Yet critics say the policy is confounding.\n\nFor one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.\n\n\u201cEach time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department\u2019s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was \u201cin the best interest\u201d of all sides without elaborating.\n\nAlso, the settlements are \u201climited to only those people who have already come forward,\u201d said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.\n\nFor driver\u2019s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nFederally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.\n\nThe lawsuit says the city\u2019s policy only \u201calienates and oppresses faith communities.\u201d In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.\n\nRobina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIn the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city\u2019s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. \u201cI just felt like I was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke me.\u201d", "keywords": ["prompts", "religious", "policy", "lawsuit", "photograph", "york", "taken", "cahn", "head", "women", "ms", "departments", "hijab", "removal"], "polarity": 0.07382182211727667, "subjectivity": 0.3865173652105469},

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C.

To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time.

The Times identified these cases \u2014 many of which are sealed \u2014 through interviews with lawyers, police officers and current and former judges.\n\n[ALSO READ: He Excelled as a Detective, Until Prosecutors Stopped Believing Him]\n\nIn these cases, officers have lied about the whereabouts of guns, putting them in suspects\u2019 hands or waistbands when they were actually hidden out of sight. They have barged into apartments and conducted searches, only to testify otherwise later. Under oath, they have given firsthand accounts of crimes or arrests that they did not in fact witness. They have falsely claimed to have watched drug deals happen, only to later recant or be shown to have lied.\n\nNo detail, seemingly, is too minor to embellish. \u201cClenched fists\u201d is how one Brooklyn officer described the hands of a man he claimed had angrily approached him and started screaming and yelling \u2014 an encounter that prosecutors later determined never occurred. Another officer, during a Bronx trial, accused a driver of recklessly crossing the double-yellow line \u2014 on a stretch of road that had no double-yellow line.\n\nIn many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people \u2014 who may or may not have committed a crime \u2014 with trumped-up evidence.\n\nIn still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object \u2014 later identified as a gun \u2014 and threw it on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cP.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,\u201d according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office wrote summarizing her testimony.\n\nBut prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\n\nPolice lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail \u2014 and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges\u2019 efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cWe have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest municipal force. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.\u201d\n\nShrouded, but Persistent\n\nThe 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That\u2019s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court \u2014 and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case \u2014 the proceedings are often sealed afterward.\n\nStill, the cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading.\n\nSo far in 2018, a Queens detective has been convicted of lying in a drug case and a Brooklyn detective has been arrested amid accusations that he fabricated the results of a photo lineup. These cases returned the phenomenon of police lying to the public eye, leaving police officials to defend the integrity of honest officers.\n\nKevin Richardson, the Police Department\u2019s top internal prosecutor, said he believed so-called testilying was nearing its end. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s very much largely on its way out,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s tempting to think about police lying as a bygone of past eras: a form of misconduct that ran unchecked as soaring street violence left the police overwhelmed during the 1980s and early 1990s and that re-emerged as police embraced stop-and-frisk tactics and covered up constitutional violations with lies.\n\nBut false testimony by the police persists even as crime has drastically receded across the city and as the Police Department has renounced the excesses of the stop-and-frisk years.\n\nSome policing experts anticipate that the ubiquity of cameras \u2014 whether on cellphones, affixed to buildings or worn by officers \u2014 will greatly reduce police lying. For the moment, however, video seems more capable of exposing lies than vanquishing them.\n\nMemory and Manipulation\n\nIn two recent cases, The Times found, officers appear to have given false accounts about witness identifications. These cases are particularly troubling because erroneous identifications by witnesses have been a leading cause of wrongful convictions.\n\nAfter a 2016 mugging near a Brooklyn subway station, the police arrested a group of four people, one of whom was found to be in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet. In preparing the case, prosecutors sought to pin down a few basic facts. Had the police brought the victim, who was punched and had his wallet taken, to positively identify the four suspects after they were taken into custody? If so, what had the victim said?\n\nGetting a straight answer from the arresting officer, Chedanan Naurang, proved nearly impossible. It had been Officer Naurang\u2019s quick thinking that had made the arrest possible: Having lost the suspects at one subway station, he followed a hunch and drove one stop down the line, where he caught up with the four men after they got off the train.\n\nBut certain details Officer Naurang gave prosecutors kept shifting over the next year, according to a February 2017 letter that prosecutors wrote in which they summarized his fluid story.\n\nOfficer Naurang said at one point that the identification had occurred inside a police station when the victim passed by the holding cells, saw the men and confirmed their involvement in the crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Two NYPD Officers Are Charged With Lying About Suspect]\n\nA few weeks later, he backtracked. No, the victim had actually never gotten to see the suspects at the police station, Officer Naurang explained. Instead, the victim had gotten a chance to view them on the street, shortly after their arrest. That\u2019s when the victim got out of the police vehicle in which he had been waiting, Officer Naurang said, and pointed to one of the four men, identifying him as an attacker.\n\nThis version of events, however, was at odds with the recollection of the police officer who had driven the victim to the scene of the arrest. That officer, Christopher McDonald, told prosecutors that the victim had remained in the back seat while viewing the four suspects. And Officer McDonald said that the victim couldn\u2019t say whether they were his assailants. He thought he recognized their clothing, but wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nBecause of Officer Naurang\u2019s changing story, prosecutors dropped the case against the men as part of a deal in which all four pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a second mugging they were accused of the same night.", "keywords": ["later", "problem", "testilying", "officer", "officers", "stubborn", "cases", "prosecutors", "suspects", "naurang", "lying", "times", "victim"], "polarity": 0.01095650381364667, "subjectivity": 0.37745734657499336},

If a young black man grabs a white woman by the crotch, he\u2019s a thug and deserves to be roughed up by police officers. But if Donald Trump grabs a white woman by the crotch in a nightclub (as he\u2019s accused of doing, and denies), it\u2019s locker-room high jinks.\n\nThis view is also expressed by many of the president\u2019s staff members, supporters and prominent allies. During the same week that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, repeatedly vouched for Rob Porter\u2019s integrity, Mr. Kelly also mused that hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants who did not fill out the paperwork for DACA protections had refused to \u201cget off their asses.\u201d\n\nA political movement that rails against \u201cimmigrant crime\u201d while defending alleged abusers and child molesters is one that has stopped pretending to have any universalist aspirations. The president\u2019s moral framework springs from an American tradition of cultivating fear and contempt among its white citizens against immigrants, indigenous people and people of color, who are placed on the other side of \u201cthe law.\u201d It\u2019s a practice that has taken on new strength at a time when many white people fear they may be outnumbered, outvoted and out of time.\n\nThis is the opposite of what we like to tell ourselves is the traditional American civic creed: one symbolized by a blindfolded Lady Justice who applies the law without fear or favor to whoever may come before her. It is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most insidious victories that he has given his supporters permission to drop any pretense of insisting that their actions and views should conform to this principle.\n\nIf all that matters when it comes to \u201claw and order\u201d is who is a friend and who is an enemy, and if friends are white and enemies are black or Latino or in the wrong party, then the rhetoric around crime and punishment stops being about justice and is merely about power and corruption.\n\nAnd this is what \u201claw and order\u201d means: the preservation of a certain social order, not the rule of law. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long to see what has always been staring us in the face. After all, the last president to focus so intensely on law and order, Richard Nixon, the man who helped usher in mass incarceration, was also the most infamous criminal to occupy the Oval Office. The history of the United States is the story of a struggle between the desire to establish certain universal rights and the countervailing desire to preserve a particular social order.\n\nWe are now witnessing a president who wholly embraces the latter. America can have that kind of social order, or it can have justice for all.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/california-marijuana-oakland-compton.html", "text": "Several states, including Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, are drawing up or have provisions in their marijuana laws to assist communities disproportionately affected by drug interdiction efforts.\n\nIn California, Oakland led the way in framing the legalization as both an opportunity to address past injustice and as a source of revenue. Yet dozens of other cities and towns across the state \u2014 including Bakersfield, Brentwood, Chico, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Mill Valley and Palo Alto \u2014 want nothing to do with recreational marijuana sales.\n\nOnly 14 percent of California\u2019s 482 cities and towns allow retail sales of recreational marijuana, according to Weedmaps, a website that hosts reviews of cannabis businesses. Californians may want access to a marijuana dispensary, just not necessarily down the block from them.\n\nWhen legalization came into effect in California in January, Oakland started a program that offered licenses to those with previous marijuana arrests. The idea, which has been copied in cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, was intended as a sort of redress for the years before legalization when blacks and other nonwhites were arrested at rates that were disproportionate to their share of the population.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs was a very specific war on a very specific community and culture,\u201d said Darlene Flynn, the director of Oakland\u2019s Department of Race and Equity.\n\nOakland\u2019s equity program goes to the heart of a paradox of legal marijuana sales in California: While large numbers of those arrested before legalization were black, most of the cannabis businesses in the post-legalization era are run by white men.\n\nLast year, Oakland produced a report showing that 77 percent of cannabis-related arrests in 2015 were of African-Americans, who make up around 30 percent of the city\u2019s 420,000 residents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of data that demonstrates that white people use and distribute drugs at the same rate as minorities do,\u201d Ms. Flynn said. \u201cThere was an extreme tilt with regards to arrests and convictions.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those with marijuana convictions, Oakland\u2019s program is open to people who lived in neighborhoods that had a particularly heavy police presence during the decades of marijuana prohibition.\n\nLike Oakland, Compton has a history of police abuse and high crime rates. In 2012, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department experimented with an aircraft that recorded high-definition images of the city, which allowed it to track everything happening on the streets. The experiment was kept secret from the city\u2019s residents until it was revealed two years later, to much outrage.\n\nBut both cities have had rising fortunes in recent years. Crime has fallen and economic prospects have brightened. The median price of a home in Compton is now $384,000, a 75 percent increase from five years ago, according to Zillow, the real estate data company. The rise has been even more dramatic in Oakland: prices have doubled in five years, to a median of $746,100.\n\nYet when the question of marijuana legalization came to Compton, residents responded with a completely different answer from Oakland.\n\nCivic and church groups in Compton banded together to campaign door-to-door against two ballot measures that would have allowed marijuana dispensaries and other cannabis manufacturing businesses.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard trying to change the image of Compton,\u201d said the Rev. Stanley W. Prince, a leader of the \u201cno\u201d campaign that was victorious in the January vote. \u201cThere is an economy that can be developed without having weed as the main product.\u201d\n\nYoung people in Compton have a much smaller margin of error than people in wealthier places, Mr. Prince said. They could easily be denied jobs or be fired from them because of marijuana use.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are trying to show that it will not work in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late January, a decisive 76 percent of voters in Compton rejected the proposals that would have allowed marijuana businesses.\n\nCompton\u2019s city manager, Cecil W. Rhambo Jr., said the vote underlined the strength of underestimated conservative views on marijuana in the city, which has a population of just under 100,000.\n\nMr. Rhambo said the vote showed that the \u201ccity portrayed in rap videos is different from the values of the older people who live here, the high propensity voters.\u201d\n\nCompton still struggles with violence \u2014 there were 27 murders in 2017. But that is a fraction of the numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLongtime Compton residents, especially those who live in parts of town with neat rows of ranch houses and citrus trees, emphasize a sense of community and the household names who grew up in the city, among them the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, the actor Kevin Costner, and the former N.F.L. commissioner Pete Rozelle. (The Williams sisters returned to Compton 16 months ago for a ceremony that dedicated a set of municipal tennis courts in their name.)\n\n\u201cIt was just an idyllic place to grow up,\u201d said James Hays, 61, the owner of a medical technology company who moved to Compton as a child in 1961. \u201cYou had nice single-family homes and manicured lawns, clean streets.\u201d\n\nLike many others in the no campaign, Mr. Hays blames the town\u2019s deterioration on drugs, including marijuana.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The group\u2019s symbol is a Viking rune on a green background.\n\nVikings \u201csymbolize everything about Northern Europeans,\u201d said Haakon Forwald, a spokesman for the Norwegian chapter of the group. \u201cWe are adventurous, we take risks and settle where no man would dare to settle.\u201d\n\nThis association has put on edge everyone from tour operators who sell Viking-themed tours to the archaeologists, runologists and historians who study the Viking era, concerned that the adoption of Viking symbols by fringe groups could toxify the meaning of a brand, a museum exhibition or an act of worship.\n\nStrong pushback has come from many corners of the Nordic countries, whether from sports fans or grass-roots organizations like \u201cVikings Against Racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat Viking symbols can be deployed in such a broad range of uses, and appeal to such a broad political spectrum, is a sign of how little is actually known about worship practices or local customs during the Viking age, said Fredrik Gregorius, an expert on religious studies and a senior lecturer at Linkoping University. This allows for an almost endless variety of interpretations of Viking culture, Dr. Gregorius said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Mr. Lundberg said membership in his group required a stated commitment against racial discrimination.\n\nAfter the ceremony by the Viking burial mound concluded \u2014 with offerings beneath a fir tree of carrots, eggs, flowers, grapes and the final sloshes of leftover beer and mead \u2014 Mr. Sonevang, the Nordic Asa Community spokesman, described his organization\u2019s goal as promoting Nordic heritage and tradition.\n\n\u201cThe more the world is in chaos, the more people are looking back to where they come from,\u201d Mr. Sonevang said. \u201cThat is where they feel safe. That is why they turn to Asatru,\u201d he added, using a word to describe the Norse religion.\n\nMr. Sonevang, who changed his first name to Stenar after deciding that Stefan sounded too Christian and therefore inappropriate for a pagan, formerly held positions in his local chapter of the Sweden Democrats. The staunchly anti-immigrant party is expected, according to polls, to consolidate its place in Sweden\u2019s political mainstream in an election in September.

By 1968, as David Halberstam wrote in a book at the time, \u201cThe easy old coalition between labor and Negroes was no longer so easy; it barely existed. The two were among the American forces most in conflict.\u201d\n\nBut Kennedy waited to enter the race until March 16, 1968, only after the peace candidate Eugene McCarthy had challenged President Lyndon B. Johnson and locked up the support of many young people and highly educated whites, who were pro-civil rights and skeptical of the war. As a result, Kennedy had to try to appeal simultaneously to minority voters and white working-class constituencies who were part of the backlash against racial progress and the peace movement. This was especially true in Kennedy\u2019s first primary state, Indiana, where Gov. George Wallace of Alabama had shocked observers four years earlier by getting strong support from white ethnic precincts when he challenged Johnson for the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy sought to build his unlikely coalition in part by running an economically populist campaign that vilified wealthy tax cheats and earned him the enmity of business leaders. \u201cWe have to convince the Negroes and the poor whites that they have common interests,\u201d he told the journalist Jack Newfield.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Kennedy knew that a populist economic message would not get through to working-class whites unless it was accompanied by a respect for their beliefs on issues like crime, welfare and patriotism. Gerard Doherty, one of his aides, recalled speaking to Kennedy: \u201cI said if he was going to win, he has to conduct a campaign for sheriff of Indiana. And he did.\u201d Coupled with strong support for civil rights, Kennedy\u2019s message about punishing looters got through. At one point during the campaign, Richard Nixon remarked to the reporter Theodore White, \u201cDo you know a lot of these people think Bobby is more a law-and-order man than I am!\u201d\n\nKennedy also campaigned on the dignity of work over welfare. In a TV commercial, he declared, \u201cI think welfare is demeaning and destructive of the human being and of his family.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for cheating the system, as Ronald Reagan later would, but said he envisioned a policy of full employment in which a person could say to himself: \u201cI helped build this country. I am a participant in its greatest public venture.\u201d\n\nOn issues of national security, Kennedy took a principled position in opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 whose very morality he questioned \u2014 but threaded the needle in a way that also made clear to working-class voters that he differed sharply from upper-middle-class white college students who avoided service or even sympathized with the North Vietnamese Communists. At Notre Dame, Kennedy was booed for saying college draft deferments should be abolished. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the unfair advantage while poor people are being drafted,\u201d he said. Remarkably, in Indiana he polled as well among those who favored Johnson\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War as he did among those who opposed it.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign to woo working-class voters across racial lines worked. The candidate most identified with advancing civil rights did well not only with black and Hispanic voters but also among working-class whites, some of whom had supported Wallace\u2019s segregationist candidacy in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA half-century later, how could progressives try to rebuild the Bobby Kennedy coalition? Kennedy\u2019s appeal was based in part on being the brother of a revered and martyred president, of course, and the most salient issues were different in 1968 than they are today. But Kennedy stressed fundamental themes that travel across time and transcend specific policy issues.\n\nFirst, to appeal to a sizable number of white working-class voters in 1968, Kennedy did not forfeit his basic principles or change his positions on civil rights, or war and peace \u2014 and neither should progressives today. Ignoring the rights of women, gay people and people of color is both morally wrong and politically stupid if your aspiration is an inclusive populism.\n\nSecond, progressives should fight for economic justice in a manner that is relentless rather than episodic. On the campaign trail, Kennedy consistently hit themes of economic inequality and named the names of wealthy individuals, like the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who paid little in taxes. By contrast, in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized economic issues in favor of attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s qualifications, according to research by Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute, and his support among white non-college voters rose considerably. Progressives also need to vigorously punish Wall Street malfeasance. It is difficult to imagine that Kennedy, a tough prosecutor, would have argued, as some members of the Obama administration did, that some companies are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nThird, progressives should explicitly signal the inclusion of working-class whites in their vision for change by applying civil rights laws to issues of class inequality, consistent with Kennedy\u2019s view that \u201cpoverty is closer to the root of the problem than color.\u201d I have long argued that we should extend the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers of all races engaged in labor organizing; integrate elementary and secondary schools not only by race but also by socioeconomic status; combat discrimination in housing by economic status as well as race; and adopt affirmative action programs in higher education for economically disadvantaged students of every color.\n\nFourth, progressives could adopt policies that respect the values of working-class people under the banner of patriotic populism, as Kennedy did. They should unapologetically champion a strong American identity around the shared values espoused in the Declaration of Independence as an antidote to exclusionary white nationalism.\n\nAn inclusive patriotic populism would be much more racially tolerant than Mr. Trump\u2019s white nationalism, and it would be tougher on national and domestic security than the populism offered by Mr. Sanders. If Robert Kennedy, the civil rights champion, could attract Wallace voters at a time of national chaos, surely the right progressive candidate with the right message could bring a significant portion of the Obama-Trump voters back home. Doing so would not only bring electoral success but also make it easier to forge a more economically progressive public policy to address America\u2019s dangerous economic divide.", "keywords": ["war", "bobby", "whites", "workingclass", "rights", "kennedy", "civil", "economic", "progressives", "white", "voters", "pathway"], "polarity": 0.1222115912602638, "subjectivity": 0.4557301204203861},

It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos. Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.\u201d\n\nMs. Clark and Ms. Aziz, like many Muslims, observe their faith by keeping their head and hair covered in the presence of anyone but family. They are joined in the suit by Turning Point for Women and Families, a nonprofit based in Queens concerned about the impact of police policies on victims of domestic violence who wind up arrested.\n\nMr. Cahn and lawyers from the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, who represent the plaintiffs, contend that the police practices are unreasonable and violate the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom under both the First Amendment and federal law.\n\nThe issue highlights the gulf between criminal justice policy, as it has evolved over time, and the cultural and religious obligations of those in custody. As it stands now, the city\u2019s policy explicitly says \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s head covering must be removed\u201d for the department\u2019s official photograph. (A separate photograph that is not considered official, and is sometimes snapped in a station house, can be taken with an arrestee wearing a religious head covering.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Yet critics say the policy is confounding.\n\nFor one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.\n\n\u201cEach time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department\u2019s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was \u201cin the best interest\u201d of all sides without elaborating.\n\nAlso, the settlements are \u201climited to only those people who have already come forward,\u201d said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.\n\nFor driver\u2019s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nFederally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.\n\nThe lawsuit says the city\u2019s policy only \u201calienates and oppresses faith communities.\u201d In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.\n\nRobina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIn the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city\u2019s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. \u201cI just felt like I was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke me.\u201d", "keywords": ["prompts", "religious", "policy", "lawsuit", "photograph", "york", "taken", "cahn", "head", "women", "ms", "departments", "hijab", "removal"], "polarity": 0.07382182211727667, "subjectivity": 0.3865173652105469},

But many later left their designated homes, gravitating to areas that already had a high concentration of migrants.\n\nEssen, a city of 600,000 people, has seen its Syrian community grow to nearly 11,000 from 1,300 in 2015, said Peter Renzel, who is in charge of social policy at City Hall.

Some have banned young men from signing up \u2014 in theory not to target migrants, but in practice exactly that.\n\nSitting in his crammed office in Essen one recent morning, arms defiantly crossed over his substantial belly, Mr. Sartor scoffed. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not saying it.\u201d\n\nA former coal worker who retired early when his mine shut down, Mr. Sartor has run the food bank for 12 years as a volunteer.\n\nHe has deliberately left the Nazi graffiti on the door and on the charity\u2019s seven delivery vans, which have also been defaced. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil three years ago, roughly one in three food bank users were foreigners, he said. By last November, it was three in four.\n\nPhoto\n\nFood bank users normally sign up for a year\u2019s pass, after demonstrating proof of need.

He was discharged as a captain.\n\nIn addition to his son Jamal, he is survived by his wife, the former Violet Cameron; another son, Haile; a daughter, Tamara; his brothers, John, Joseph and Raymond; and his sister, Mary Ann Glass.\n\nAmong Mr. Payne\u2019s first undercover assignments for Newsday was to spend a month in a migrant labor camp in Riverhead, in eastern Long Island, laying irrigation pipe on a potato farm.

Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\n\nMost white boys raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper middle class as adults, but black boys raised in similarly rich households will not. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in rich families \u2026 Replay \u21ba Adult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEven when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become. Though black girls and women face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.\n\nLarge income gaps persist between men \u2014 but not women. Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they\u2019re raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white women raised in similar households.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study.\n\nBlack boys \u2014 even rich black boys \u2014 can seemingly never assume that.\n\nThe study, based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all Americans now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.\n\nThe disparities that remain also can\u2019t be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren\u2019t handicapping women,\u201d said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.\n\nA more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don\u2019t accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.\n\nIf this inequality can\u2019t be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home \u2014 in surrounding neighborhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\n\n\u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\u201d said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Chetty said, \u201cis that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in America.\u201d\n\nThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets \u2014 including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\n\nShare of children living in low-poverty neighborhoods with many fathers present\n\nShare of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods with few fathers present\n\n\u201cThat is a pathbreaking finding,\u201d said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the direct effects of a boy\u2019s own parents\u2019 marital status. They\u2019re talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\u201d\n\nOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.\n\nThe research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.\n\nFor poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys will remain poor as adults. White boys raised in poor families fare far better. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in poor families \u2026 Replay \u21ba\n\n\u201cThis crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we\u2019ve seen it over time,\u201d said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the Obama White House on My Brother\u2019s Keeper, a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural racism targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.\n\nMr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.\n\nWill Jawando was raised in a low-income household in Silver Spring, Md. A lawyer and a former Obama White House staffer, he is among the rare black boys who reached the top fifth of the income distribution as an adult. T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nHe was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents\u2019 incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.\n\nPrevious research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of color face both sexism and racism.\n\nOther studies show that boys, across races, are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in poverty or facing discrimination. While black women also face negative effects of racism, black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As early as preschool, they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we\u2019ve made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\u201d said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less education.\n\nThe new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent \u2014 by millionaires \u2014 were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.\n\nThe sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning $36,000. Share of the men incarcerated on April 1, 2010 Includes men who were ages 27 to 32 in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, boys benefit more than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a variety of studies have found. Mentors who aren\u2019t children\u2019s parents, but who share those children\u2019s gender and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has found. That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child\u2019s home, appears to make a difference.\n\nSome of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with previous research that has shown that the effects of racial discrimination cross class lines. Although all children benefit from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.\n\n\u201cSimply because you\u2019re in an area that is more affluent, it\u2019s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\u201d said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people.\n\nThis dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations \u2014 he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\n\n\u201cI think if I\u2019m putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\u201d he said. \u201cOr will people recognize me at all?\u201d Those small daily decisions \u2014 to wear a blazer or not \u2014 follow him despite his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think you escape those things,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Findings From the Research\n\nThis study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.\n\nThere\u2019s a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black Americans, even after accounting for income. Percent of the children married in 2015 Includes men and women who were ages 32 to 37 in 2015.\n\nOne reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income \u2014 not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don\u2019t have married parents, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.\n\nThis study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they\u2019re raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\n\nThe income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two.\n\nAs this chart shows, a black man raised by two parents together in the 90th percentile \u2014 making around $140,000 a year \u2014 earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making $60,000 alone.\n\nThe high mobility rate for Asian-Americans is partly about immigration. Based on a sample of the children. Few Native Americans have immigrant mothers; their differences in income are not meaningful.\n\nAsian-Americans earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose parents were born in the United States. Non-immigrant Asian-Americans fare about as well in the economy as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)\n\nThe worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children. Average income of white children from poor families Average income of all children from poor families Average income of black children from poor families\n\nIn previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it\u2019s now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.\n\nPoor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of America. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for all children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.\n\nVery few nonwhite Americans started at the very top. Income distribution of the children in the study Excludes those reporting multiple races and those for whom no race was identified.\n\nAfrican-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.\n\nThe Real Starting Positions\n\nThe ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families \u2014 what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.\n\nIn reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. The chart below depicts boys from every income quintile \u2013 not just the top or bottom ones \u2013 proportioned according to their real starting places in life.", "keywords": ["children", "black", "study", "raised", "shows", "white", "men", "income", "poor", "racism", "reach", "punishing", "extensive", "data", "boys", "families"], "polarity": 0.04345987110817618, "subjectivity": 0.4166377149216133},

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would \u201cvery likely substantiate claims\u201d of a persistent inequality in the \u201ctreatments of students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnsuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote.\n\nBut in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators\u2019 perception of both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pressure cooker,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the district\u2019s chief of schools. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening across America.\u201d\n\nWhile critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.\n\nBernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\n[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "guidance", "discipline", "minnesota", "punished", "school", "york", "students", "ms", "quandary", "teachers", "districts", "national", "white", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

The world was suddenly alive with metallic, high-speed color, and the sweet thrill of my Hot Wheels childhood came rushing back.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe sound of 24 IndyCars in flat-out combat was a hivelike buzzing \u2014 a high-intensity hum that faded when the cars rounded a curve out of sight but that re-upped when they appeared in the straightaway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Firestone Grand Prix is the annual opening race of the Verizon IndyCar Series.

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities. According to research by Dr. Narjust Duma of the Mayo Clinic, only 6 percent of participants in clinical trials are black, although African-Americans make up approximately 12 percent of the population; Hispanics amount to 3 percent of participants, although they make up about 15 percent of the population.\n\n\u201cIf our government doesn\u2019t fix this,\u201d one protester in \u201cCompany Town\u201d says, \u201cthen I don\u2019t know what kind of government they are.\u201d If we don\u2019t fix this, I chime in, what sort of people are we?", "keywords": ["black", "gap", "cancer", "cancers", "continue", "women", "dr", "matters", "mortality", "breast", "brawley"], "polarity": 0.04489312770562769, "subjectivity": 0.360705266955267},

The nurse practitioner called 911, and the police arrived and did an assessment; they recommended that our tenant be moved to a place where his needs could be met. But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts.

But I\u2019m worried that our tenant will try to cook something and start a fire, injuring himself and possibly our family. And while I sympathize with his relative, I also worry that she is being grossly careless. My inclination is to follow up on the report recommending that he be moved to a suitable facility, rather than wait to see if action is taken. What would you suggest?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nName Withheld\n\nWe lose the right to manage our own life only when we become incapable of responsible decision-making. And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house? If he\u2019s in the process of discarding the detritus of his parents\u2019 lives, it may just be that this is going slowly, especially if he\u2019s an only child. He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem. He might resent the observation, but the chance that you could spur him to seek the help he needs would be worth risking your not-very-close relationship.", "keywords": ["youre", "stay", "york", "nurse", "neighbors", "racist", "house", "relative", "needs", "renters", "left", "tenant", "place", "warn"], "polarity": 0.09738230519480523, "subjectivity": 0.36862554112554113},

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

His mother, Josephine, moved Les and his two older brothers in 1954 to Hartford, where she remarried.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter high school, he enrolled at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, where he switched from a major in engineering and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English. He spent six years in the Army, serving as a Ranger in Vietnam, where, among other things, he wrote speeches for Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the American commander there. He was discharged as a captain.\n\nIn addition to his son Jamal, he is survived by his wife, the former Violet Cameron; another son, Haile; a daughter, Tamara; his brothers, John, Joseph and Raymond; and his sister, Mary Ann Glass.\n\nAmong Mr. Payne\u2019s first undercover assignments for Newsday was to spend a month in a migrant labor camp in Riverhead, in eastern Long Island, laying irrigation pipe on a potato farm. The grueling work evoked memories of picking cotton when he was 8 for $2 per 100 pounds.\n\n\u201cMuch has changed in the world since 1949,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut little, I found, has improved for black farm laborers.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1978, he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for international reporting for an 11-part series on South Africa.\n\nOnce he was armed with a weekly column, he established a reputation as a passionate champion of people who were powerless to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cHe acts like he is nobody\u2019s subordinate,\u201d Murray Kempton, his fellow Newsday columnist, once said. \u201cAnd he acts like he has no subordinates below him.

Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants, who became the Democratic nominee and nominal front-runner. \u201cAs the descendant of immigrants who arrived here in 1619,\u201d Mr. Payne wrote, \u201cJackson and his brethren with presidential aspirations are still barred from the White House because of the color of their skin.\u201d\n\nBut after Tawana Brawley, a black teenager, created a nationwide uproar in 1987 when she accused four white men of raping her in upstate New York, Mr. Payne dauntlessly described the incident as a hoax and braved scathing criticism from Ms. Brawley\u2019s most outspoken defender, the Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nMr. Payne was the first to fully report an account by Ms. Brawley\u2019s former boyfriend that she told him she had been neither assaulted nor raped.\n\nHis column, which also reached New York City readers in Newsday\u2019s offshoot tabloid, New York Newsday, during its 10-year run, ended in 2009.\n\nMr. Payne faced down more dangerous adversaries than Mr. Sharpton. When he first sought an assignment in Africa, Mr. Payne recalled, he was told by his editors that a black reporter\u2019s judgment might be compromised.\n\nOnce he got there, he learned that being black was not necessarily an advantage.

Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\n\nMost white boys raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper middle class as adults, but black boys raised in similarly rich households will not. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in rich families \u2026 Replay \u21ba Adult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEven when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low poverty and good schools.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by what is happening among these boys and the men they become. Though black girls and women face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.\n\nLarge income gaps persist between men \u2014 but not women. Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they\u2019re raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white women raised in similar households.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought at some point you escape the poverty trap,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study.\n\nBlack boys \u2014 even rich black boys \u2014 can seemingly never assume that.\n\nThe study, based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all Americans now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar education levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.\n\nThe disparities that remain also can\u2019t be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren\u2019t handicapping women,\u201d said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.\n\nA more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don\u2019t accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.\n\nIf this inequality can\u2019t be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home \u2014 in surrounding neighborhoods, in the economy and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\n\n\u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\u201d said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Chetty said, \u201cis that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in America.\u201d\n\nThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low poverty rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets \u2014 including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx \u2014 were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\n\nShare of children living in low-poverty neighborhoods with many fathers present\n\nShare of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods with few fathers present\n\n\u201cThat is a pathbreaking finding,\u201d said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about the direct effects of a boy\u2019s own parents\u2019 marital status. They\u2019re talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\u201d\n\nOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.\n\nThe research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.\n\nFor poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys will remain poor as adults. White boys raised in poor families fare far better. \u2026and see where they end up as adults: Follow the lives of boys who grew up in poor families \u2026 Replay \u21ba\n\n\u201cThis crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we\u2019ve seen it over time,\u201d said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the Obama White House on My Brother\u2019s Keeper, a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural racism targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.\n\nMr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.\n\nWill Jawando was raised in a low-income household in Silver Spring, Md. A lawyer and a former Obama White House staffer, he is among the rare black boys who reached the top fifth of the income distribution as an adult. T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nHe was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their parents\u2019 incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.\n\nPrevious research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between women, even though women of color face both sexism and racism.\n\nOther studies show that boys, across races, are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in poverty or facing discrimination. While black women also face negative effects of racism, black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As early as preschool, they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we\u2019ve made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\u201d said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less education.\n\nThe new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent \u2014 by millionaires \u2014 were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about $36,000.\n\nThe sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning $36,000. Share of the men incarcerated on April 1, 2010 Includes men who were ages 27 to 32 in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, boys benefit more than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a variety of studies have found. Mentors who aren\u2019t children\u2019s parents, but who share those children\u2019s gender and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has found. That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child\u2019s home, appears to make a difference.\n\nSome of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with previous research that has shown that the effects of racial discrimination cross class lines. Although all children benefit from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.\n\n\u201cSimply because you\u2019re in an area that is more affluent, it\u2019s still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\u201d said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent black people.\n\nThis dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations \u2014 he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\n\n\u201cI think if I\u2019m putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\u201d he said. \u201cOr will people recognize me at all?\u201d Those small daily decisions \u2014 to wear a blazer or not \u2014 follow him despite his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think you escape those things,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Findings From the Research\n\nThis study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.\n\nThere\u2019s a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black Americans, even after accounting for income. Percent of the children married in 2015 Includes men and women who were ages 32 to 37 in 2015.\n\nOne reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and women are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income \u2014 not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don\u2019t have married parents, the argument goes, they\u2019re more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.\n\nThis study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they\u2019re raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\n\nThe income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two.\n\nAs this chart shows, a black man raised by two parents together in the 90th percentile \u2014 making around $140,000 a year \u2014 earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making $60,000 alone.\n\nThe high mobility rate for Asian-Americans is partly about immigration. Based on a sample of the children. Few Native Americans have immigrant mothers; their differences in income are not meaningful.\n\nAsian-Americans earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose parents were born in the United States. Non-immigrant Asian-Americans fare about as well in the economy as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)\n\nThe worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children. Average income of white children from poor families Average income of all children from poor families Average income of black children from poor families\n\nIn previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it\u2019s now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.\n\nPoor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of America. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for all children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.\n\nVery few nonwhite Americans started at the very top. Income distribution of the children in the study Excludes those reporting multiple races and those for whom no race was identified.\n\nAfrican-Americans made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.\n\nThe Real Starting Positions\n\nThe ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families \u2014 what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.\n\nIn reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. The chart below depicts boys from every income quintile \u2013 not just the top or bottom ones \u2013 proportioned according to their real starting places in life.", "keywords": ["children", "black", "study", "raised", "shows", "white", "men", "income", "poor", "racism", "reach", "punishing", "extensive", "data", "boys", "families"], "polarity": 0.04345987110817618, "subjectivity": 0.4166377149216133},

Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C.

The descriptions of white children by teachers included \u201cgifted but can\u2019t use his words\u201d and \u201chigh strung,\u201d with their actions excused because they \u201chad a hard day.\u201d\n\nBlack children, she said, were \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201ccannot be managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see something like that and you\u2019re a leader, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward \u2014 it was alarming,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\n\n[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]\n\nNationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state\u2019s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.\n\nLast month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a tipping point, and that\u2019s what you see in the schools\u201d said Kevin Lindsey, the state\u2019s human rights commissioner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.\n\n\u201cOur students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting our listening frequency.\u201d\n\nBut some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student\u2019s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.\n\nSimon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district\u2019s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as \u201ccultural dialect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt threw the school into complete chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids knew they weren\u2019t going to go home.\u201d\n\nMr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word \u201cdetention,\u201d but rather \u201cquality time.\u201d Eventually, he would just \u201csweep a lot under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years \u2014 a warning, then a consequence \u2014 was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.\u201d\n\nThe root of those changes was in the district\u2019s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.\n\nFederal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher\u2019s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.\n\nMs. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move \u201clegally and constitutionally suspect.\u201d He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was \u201cintroducing a racial quota system for school discipline.\u201d\n\nOne month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.\n\n\u201cWhen people have kids around them that don\u2019t look like them, they want them controlled,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district\u2019s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.\n\nThere are bright spots.\n\nAt Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a \u201cloaded term,\u201d said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data \u2014 there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year \u2014 showed that the school was a \u201chealthy place\u201d that emphasized positive reinforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to misbehavior, \u201cthe conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that\u2019s wrong with them,\u201d he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. \u201cIf students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it\u2019s our job to figure out why.\u201d\n\nBut, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.\n\nJustice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.\n\nFresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.\n\nThe school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.\n\n\u201cI think we have to challenge our own biases every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSome teachers aren\u2019t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we\u2019re not going to give up on students, and I\u2019m not going to give up on them.\u201d\n\nThere are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state\u2019s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota\u2019s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.\n\n\u201cWe are more than these numbers,\u201d Ms. Rathke said. \u201cBut they\u2019re telling us something: We have students that we just haven\u2019t figured out how to support yet.\u201d", "keywords": ["black", "guidance", "discipline", "minnesota", "punished", "school", "york", "students", "ms", "quandary", "teachers", "districts", "national", "white", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.037610525956982645, "subjectivity": 0.3929063980638785},

According to the 2016-18 report on Cancer Facts and Figures for African-Americans, \u201cdespite lower incidence rates for breast and uterine cancers, black women have death rates for these cancers that are 42 percent and 92 percent higher, respectively, than white women.\u201d Investigators connect the ghastly numbers to the usual socioeconomic discrepancies but also to biological differences in the malignancies of black women.\n\nWith regard to breast cancer, is the mortality gap related to a greater percentage of black women than white women contending with an aggressive form of the disease that lacks estrogen receptors?\n\nDr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, rejects an explanation based on \u201cbiological difference,\u201d pointing instead to dietary disparities.\n\nDisadvantaged Americans consume more calories and carbohydrates, \u201cthe sort of food that is available in poor areas of inner cities,\u201d Dr. Brawley writes in his book \u201cHow We Do Harm.\u201d Greater body weight means African-American girls menstruate earlier and the number of uninterrupted menstrual cycles increases the risk of breast cancer: \u201cThe black-white gap in the onset of menstruation and body weight has dramatically widened, which means that the disease disparities will widen also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Brawley quotes an all-white study in Scotland that \u201cfound evidence pointing to a correlation between social deprivation and incidence of breast cancer that lacks estrogen receptors.\u201d In addition, he cites the insight of his friend Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute: \u201cPoverty is a carcinogen.\u201d\n\nGiven the mortality discrepancies, it is disturbing that African-Americans are underrepresented as subjects in cancer research, as are other minorities. According to research by Dr. Narjust Duma of the Mayo Clinic, only 6 percent of participants in clinical trials are black, although African-Americans make up approximately 12 percent of the population; Hispanics amount to 3 percent of participants, although they make up about 15 percent of the population.\n\n\u201cIf our government doesn\u2019t fix this,\u201d one protester in \u201cCompany Town\u201d says, \u201cthen I don\u2019t know what kind of government they are.\u201d If we don\u2019t fix this, I chime in, what sort of people are we?", "keywords": ["black", "gap", "cancer", "cancers", "continue", "women", "dr", "matters", "mortality", "breast", "brawley"], "polarity": 0.04489312770562769, "subjectivity": 0.360705266955267},

He is in fragile health, nearly completely deaf and often in a confused state. Each time he has returned from the hospital or rehab, he has refused a caregiver or visiting home nurse. His relative cannot care for him, so he is left alone for much of the time. She seems hostile to any suggestions on our part and frustrated, because he won\u2019t listen to her either.\n\nRecently, he was hospitalized twice in the space of a few weeks. The last time he was released, a nurse practitioner came the following afternoon to check on him. When she buzzed the doorbell, there was no answer, so she tried us. We let her in, only to discover that our tenant had pulled out his catheter and was incoherent. The nurse practitioner called 911, and the police arrived and did an assessment; they recommended that our tenant be moved to a place where his needs could be met. But they said moving him against his will would require a social worker\u2019s recommendation, plus other legal actions.\n\nWe could not reach his relative by phone, despite multiple attempts. She came the next day to bring him back to the hospital to reinsert the catheter. She accompanied the ambulance that took him home.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But I\u2019m worried that our tenant will try to cook something and start a fire, injuring himself and possibly our family. And while I sympathize with his relative, I also worry that she is being grossly careless. My inclination is to follow up on the report recommending that he be moved to a suitable facility, rather than wait to see if action is taken. What would you suggest?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nName Withheld\n\nWe lose the right to manage our own life only when we become incapable of responsible decision-making. And as the police officers told you, that\u2019s a judgment that needs to be made by a trained person. Still, the events you describe strongly suggest that your tenant has reached this point, and that it\u2019s more important to take care of him than to respect his demands to be left alone.\n\nYou have two rather different sets of concerns here. One is for your building and your family: Your tenant\u2019s condition poses a risk of serious harm to both. The other is for your tenant: You have good evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be left alone, for the sake of his health and his well-being. If his interests and yours pulled in opposite directions, you might face a hard choice. But they don\u2019t. The first set of concerns gives you moral standing to intervene. Unless his relative accepts responsibility for him, the fact that she disagrees is, morally speaking, neither here nor there. Given that you do have standing, you should then aim to do what is best for him and, as it happens, for you. It would be both prudent and caring to explore getting him into a place where he can be properly looked after.\n\nA college friend invited me to stay with him when I returned to my hometown after a long absence. He lives alone in a house he inherited. The bed linens were clean, and the bathroom was clean, but there were dust, cobwebs and clutter all over the house, and the whole place needed a good cleaning, painting and replacement of flooring. He said he was trying to downsize, but the living room was filled with sheets, books, pans. I really had no recourse but to stay there, as he was my transport to the airport several hours away, and I did. In retrospect, I worry about him and his mental state. What can I do?\n\nName Withheld\n\nHow long has he been in the house? If he\u2019s in the process of discarding the detritus of his parents\u2019 lives, it may just be that this is going slowly, especially if he\u2019s an only child. He invited you in, you say, and your bedroom and bathroom were fine. Still, I\u2019ll grant that what you describe would seem consistent with conditions like depression or even compulsive hoarding. Aside from his cluttered and untidy home, did he seem to be socially isolated or impeded in major life activities?\n\nAssuming that he does have a serious problem, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you have a close-enough relationship with this man to intervene effectively from a distance. Do you know of friends or relatives who are in a position to do more? If you think you\u2019re the only person who has noticed and is in a position to do anything, you might help your friend simply by letting him know that the condition of his house has made you wonder whether he has a problem. He might resent the observation, but the chance that you could spur him to seek the help he needs would be worth risking your not-very-close relationship.", "keywords": ["youre", "stay", "york", "nurse", "neighbors", "racist", "house", "relative", "needs", "renters", "left", "tenant", "place", "warn"], "polarity": 0.09738230519480523, "subjectivity": 0.36862554112554113},

Wear it as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, Bannon\u2019s advice is strange. After all, by any normative understanding, \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cxenophobe\u201d and \u201cnativist\u201d are negative words from both a moral and rational point of view. Their definitions, taken from any standard dictionary, will bear this out. Racism, xenophobia and nativism embody, in their very meanings, both irrationality and unfairness. Irrationality is considered to be a negative quality (except perhaps by Dadaists); so is unfairness.\n\nFor those of us to wish to understand the way Bannon is manipulating language here, and to what end, it is important to note what he is not doing. It is typical for far-right politicians who want to attract racist, xenophobic or nativist voters to attempt to provide at least the pretense of reasons, invariably shoddy ones, for animus against racial minorities, immigrants, or foreigners.\n\nIn the United States, President Trump regularly connects individual crimes or criminal gangs with immigration in an effort to more broadly establish a link between immigrants with crime in the public consciousness. Though studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, Trump continues to make such claims (his statement that immigrants bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d received a score of \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d from fact-checkers).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly bizarre false claims are made by non-American far-right politicians, who also regularly engage in anti-Semitic innuendo. There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law. After taking office, she described historically black universities and colleges, founded in response to segregation, as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d\n\nAs this comment suggested, DeVos is, at best, oblivious about race. That obliviousness \u2014 or worse \u2014 is behind one of the more disturbing moments in her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. In a sick irony, some on the right would use the recent school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 allegedly committed by a young man who carved swastikas into the magazines for his semiautomatic rifle \u2014 as a pretext to roll back civil rights protections for students of color. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d DeVos, whom Trump has chosen to lead his new school safety commission, appeared to signal she\u2019s on board.\n\nTo understand how, we need to start with a letter that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, sent to DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 5 about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubio referred to a 2014 Barack Obama-era directive, known as the Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, intended to address the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, in which disadvantaged students are funneled into the criminal justice system for misbehaving at school. The Dear Colleague Letter said school personnel must \u201cunderstand that they, rather than school resource officers and other security or law enforcement personnel, are responsible for administering routine student discipline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Ann Coulter made a similar argument in a column published in Breitbart: \u201cCruz\u2019s criminal acts were intentionally ignored by law enforcement on account of Broward\u2019s much-celebrated \u2018school-to-prison pipeline\u2019 reforms.\u201d", "keywords": ["60", "education", "minutes", "sign", "letter", "secretary", "school", "pipeline", "york", "betsy", "devos", "law", "schooltoprison", "expand"], "polarity": 0.03899602335648848, "subjectivity": 0.48572963857847584},
