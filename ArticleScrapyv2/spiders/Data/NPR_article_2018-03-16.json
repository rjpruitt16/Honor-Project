As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' \" Sessions also said in explaining his decision.\n\nIn a statement issued immediately after his termination was announced, McCabe said the decision was politically motivated. \"The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people,\" McCabe said.\n\n\"Here is the reality:,\" he added, \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens.\"\n\nMcCabe announced his retirement from the bureau abruptly in January and it was to take effect this Sunday.\n\nHis dismissal, just days before he was set to retire, puts his full pension and benefits package in jeopardy and is an inglorious end to career of almost 22 years with the bureau.\n\nA longtime target\n\nRepublicans have been attacking McCabe since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHis wife, Jill, ran for a state legislative seat in Virginia as a Democrat and accepted campaign contributions via then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton loyalist. The FBI and Justice Department's compliance offices found no problems with the situation but Republicans called it a conflict of interest.\n\nEven while he was on the campaign trail during the 2016 race and at times since taking office, President Trump has complained about what he called McCabe's bias and called for Sessions to fire him.\n\nBy mid-December 2017, before McCabe was set to testify behind closed doors with the House intelligence committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., alluded to McCabe's rocky standing.\n\n\"I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,\" said Gowdy, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee which has oversight responsibility for the bureau, in a Dec. 15 interview with Fox News.\n\nMcCabe served as the acting director of the FBI for three months in 2017, after Trump abruptly fired James Comey, and before the current director, Christopher Wray, was sworn in. McCabe made news in a congressional hearing in May by contradicting Trump.\n\nThe White House had said Trump fired Comey because he had lost the confidence of the FBI's rank-and-file agents and workers \u2014 but McCabe, when asked, said that was not so.\n\n\"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day,\" McCabe told lawmakers soon after the president had ousted Comey.\n\nBehind the scenes, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz was continuing to investigate Comey and McCabe and the bureau's handling of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The IG's office drafted a report that is believed to include the allegation that McCabe lacked candor with investigators about his contacts with a Wall Street Journal reporter. In addition, the statement from Sessions late Friday said the OIG and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility also faulted McCabe for \"an unauthorized disclosure to the news media.\"\n\nAccordingly, the OPR recommended that McCabe lose his job.\n\nPeople in McCabe's camp said earlier this week that he has an explanation for any inconsistencies in his account of the conversations with the journalist, and in each instance, he went back and corrected the record, often citing the chaos around him and the FBI at the time. He has followed up with investigators as part of the Justice Department process.\n\nIn his statement Friday McCabe explained events this way:\n\n\"The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\"\n\nMcCabe added that his contacts with the reporter were \"not a secret,\" were known to others at the FBI at the time including then-Director Comey, were typical of the exchanges with the media he regularly oversaw as deputy director and was also the kind of work he continued under Director Wray.\n\n\"The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth,\" McCabe also said in his statement. \"During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\"\n\nIn January, when Wray attempted to move McCabe into another job to limit the FBI's embarrassment when the IG report became public, McCabe abruptly announced his retirement. His plan was to use up accumulated leave he was due before his previously scheduled retirement date this month.\n\nTrump and his supporters group McCabe with what they call other bad actors inside the FBI, including two employees who exchanged text messages critical of Trump in 2016. That revelation also has embarrassed the FBI and fueled critics' accusations that people inside the bureau abused their power to target Trump out of personal animus.\n\nA raw deal?\n\nMcCabe's supporters, led by Comey, say he has been badly mistreated. \"Special Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on,\" the former FBI director wrote on Twitter in late January when McCabe announced his retirement. \"He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well.\"\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department and their allies in Congress deny the charges of \"bias\" and say there is no deep conspiracy aimed at Trump, nor any wrongdoing in use of surveillance authority by FBI or DOJ as Republicans charge.\n\nFor his part, McCabe told members of Congress shortly after Comey's firing last year that he was confident the bureau would continue to pursue the Justice Department's Russia investigation and do its other work amidst the controversy.\n\n\"You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,\" he said, \"protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.\"", "keywords": ["comey", "justice", "embattled", "short", "retirement", "fbi", "report", "investigation", "deputy", "sessions", "mccabe", "department", "fires", "trump", "director"], "polarity": 0.0011727021220692164, "subjectivity": 0.39117150430441566},

Denney Pate, lead engineer with FIGG Bridge Engineers, a Tallahassee firm.\n\n\"'Hey Tom, this is Denney Pate with FIGG bridge engineers. Calling to, uh, share with you some information about the FIU pedestrian bridge and some cracking that's been observed on the north end of the span, the pylon end of that span we moved this weekend. Um, so, uh, we've taken a look at it and, uh, obviously some repairs or whatever will have to be done but from a safety perspective we don't see that there's any issue there so we're not concerned about it from that perspective although obviously the cracking is not good and something's going to have to be, ya know, done to repair that. At any rate, I wanted to chat with you about that because I suspect at some point that's gonna get to your desk. So, uh, at any rate, call me back when you can. Thank you. Bye.'\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nAccording to a FDOT statement, the voicemail was not heard by an agency employee until Friday, March 16, after he returned to his office from an assignment. The bridge collapsed on Thursday.\n\nThe FDOT statement does not identify \"Tom,\" the employee with whom Pate was attempting to share his information.\n\nFDOT also noted that the university, FIU, bore the responsibility for the bridge's construction.\n\n\"The responsibility to identify and address life-safety issues and properly communicate them is the sole responsibility of the FIU design build team. At no point during any of the communications above did FIGG or any member of the FIU design build team ever communicate a life-safety issue. Again, FIGG and the FIU design build team never alerted FDOT of any life-safety issue regarding the FIU pedestrian bridge prior to collapse.\"\n\nThe engineering company Figg said in a statement that it is working with authorities to determine the cause of the collapse.\n\n\"We are heartbroken by the loss of life and injuries, and are carefully examining the steps that our team has taken in the interest of our overarching concern for public safety. The evaluation was based on the best available information at that time and indicated that there were no safety issues. We will pursue answers to find out what factors led to this tragic situation, but it is important that the agencies responsible for investigating this devastating situation are given the appropriate time in order to accurately identify what factors led to the accident during construction.\"\n\nSearch-and-rescue teams have been carefully unearthing bodies and vehicles from under the concrete bridge that collapsed suddenly in Miami on Thursday afternoon. Questions about the bridge's design and construction are just beginning.\n\nThe 174-foot, 950-ton main span had been lifted into place just five days earlier. At least six people were killed and 10 were injured in the collapse, according to The Associated Press.\n\nOn Thursday night, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted: \"The cables that suspend the #Miami bridge had loosened & the engineering firm ordered that they be tightened. They were being tightened when it collapsed today.\"\n\nBecause the bridge's central tower and suspension cables were not yet installed, the Miami Herald notes, any cables being tightened were likely wires that ran through the span.\n\nThe bridge was supposed to make the crossing of a perilous seven-lane roadway safer for students and staff at Florida International University. The bridge connected the university campus to the small suburban city of Sweetwater, where many students and faculty live. An FIU student was killed crossing the road in August.\n\nRubio is an adjunct professor at the university. His spokeswoman told the newspaper that he had heard this information from workers on-site.\n\nAt a news conference on Friday morning, assembled authorities would not confirm Rubio's statement.\n\n\"This is a tragedy we don't want to reoccur anywhere in the U.S.,\" said Juan Perez, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. \"Right now, we just want to find out what occurred, what caused this collapse to occur and people to die.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are investigating.\n\n\"The people of South Florida have been though a lot, obviously, over the last several weeks and this is just yet one more tragedy to add to that sad book,\" said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt.\n\nAuthorities said their investigation will take time, but early questions have emerged about whether it was wise to install the span across the road without first installing the central support tower.\n\nWitnesses told WLRN the span fell without warning as a traffic light went red. Two workers were on the bridge when it collapsed, according to witnesses interviewed by the Miami Herald.\n\nLast weekend, FIU tweeted a photo of what the completed bridge would look like.\n\nAs USA Today reports, the design was for a type of suspension bridge called a cable-stayed bridge:\n\n\"Cable-stayed bridges have cables attached directly from the column to the span, while suspension bridges string cables between towers and have other cables descend to the span. \"Amjad Aref, a professor at University of Buffalo's Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, said a suspended bridge is typically built gradually, with the center tower or towers erected early. \"Pictures from the scene of the collapse don't show a central tower. \" 'Whoever is going to investigate, they will ask the fundamental question: shouldn't the tower be there, and the cables ready to connect to the structure, when you lift it?' Aref said. 'That's a question for them to answer.' \"\n\nFIU offers an entire program around bridge projects like this one: the Center for Accelerated Bridge Construction, which opened in 2011. \"This method of construction reduces potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions,\" the university said in a press release when the span was swung into space last weekend.\n\nMuch of the funding for the $14.2 million bridge and its plazas and walkways came from a U.S. Department of Transportation grant.\n\nThe bridge was designed by FIGG Bridge Engineers and built by MCM Construction.

There are required waiting periods,\" Calonge says.\n\nAccording to Guttmacher, 27 states make women wait at least 24 hours for an abortion and 11 states require women to have an ultrasound before they can terminate their pregnancy.\n\nAnd there are state laws that dictate who can perform abortions and where they can do them. Some require all abortions to happen in the equivalent of a hospital or surgery center. Others require a doctor to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe National Academies report says waiting periods and requirements for unnecessary tests can result in long delays because women may have to travel to get care and have trouble getting appointments.\n\n\"Delays put the patient at greater risk of an adverse event,\" the report says.\n\nHal Lawrence, the CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says the report settles the debate over abortion-restricting laws and regulations.\n\n\"Those sorts of laws have been totally debunked,\" he says.\n\nHe says the study shows most of those laws do nothing to improve women's health.\n\n\"Abortion is safer when it's performed earlier in gestation,\" Lawrence says. \"And so delaying and making people wait and go through hoops of unnecessary, extra procedures does not improve the safety.

Cheryl Kagan introduced the bill last month and while it initially sought to repeal and replace the song, Kagan said the watered-down version is a \"compromise.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Kagan called it \"a modest effort to address our outdated & offensive State Song,\" adding that it helps \"address our racist past.\"\n\nIn 1861, the year the Civil War broke out, native Marylander James Ryder Randall, angry about Union troops marching through Baltimore, put pen to paper and out poured his frustration. The poem's first stanza gets right to a bellicose and bloody message:\n\n\"Avenge the patriotic gore That flecked the streets of Baltimore, And be the battle queen of yore, Maryland! My Maryland!\"\n\nAnd 157 years later, a part toward the end about \"Northern scum\" still seems to rankle. (See the full lyrics below.)\n\nRandall had moved to Georgia and his support of the Confederacy was clear.\n\nBut even though Maryland remained in the Union during the war, it falls south of the Mason Dixon Line. The State Archives describes the somewhat ambiguous position Maryland held, saying it \"was walking a tightrope between the Union and the Confederacy. In addition to being physically between the two sides, Maryland depended equally on the North and the South for its economy. Although Maryland had always leaned toward the south culturally, sympathies in the state were as much pro-Union as they were pro-Confederate.\"\n\nSet to the tune of \"O, Tannenbaum,\" Randall's poem became a song, attaining popularity in Maryland and farther south, but it wasn't until 1939 that it was officially adopted as the state song.\n\nState GOP lawmakers have defended the song's historical significance.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Cassilly told NPR in an email that while he disagrees with the Confederate cause Randall extolled, he said the poem also invokes the Revolutionary War. \"I cannot help but be inspired by his poetic references to Maryland's history to justify a call to action and it is wrong to reject his contributions to our culture simply as a matter of ideological purity,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings, a Republican, dismissed the measure as \"a participation trophy bill\" and a \"waste of time,\" reports The Baltimore Sun.\n\nBut lawmakers in neighboring Virginia successfully voted in 1997 to retire their state song originally titled \"Carry Me Back To Old Virginny\" that was seen as a paean to slavery.\n\nIn Maryland, attempts to revise or remove the state song are not novel.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported in 2016 that lawmakers had revisited the song at least eight times since it was adopted.\n\nEfforts have gained ground in recent months, following the violence around last summer's white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and Confederate memorials being removed or shrouded elsewhere across the country.\n\nLast fall, the University of Maryland announced it was suspending performance of the song at athletic events and invited students to submit their own alternate lyrics for a competition to find a new state song.\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Barbara Robinson, a Baltimore Democrat who backed the bill, told the Sun, \"it's not changing history.

Roberts/AP Zach D. Roberts/AP\n\nDeAndre Harris, a black man brutally beaten after a white nationalist rally last August in Charlottesville, Va., has been found not guilty of misdemeanor assault for his role in the incident. The city's General District Court handed down the ruling Friday.\n\nHarold Crews, 48, an attorney and chairman of the North Carolina League of the South, had pressed charges against Harris on Oct. 12 \u2014 two months to the day after hundreds of white nationalists across the U.S. descended on Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally. Deadly violence followed that demonstration, including the beating Harris sustained at the hands of several white men, which was caught on camera and later went viral.\n\nHarris, 20, suffered serious injuries during the attack, saying later that because of the beating, he had \"eight staples in my head, a broken wrist and a chipped tooth.\"\n\nBut Crews argued that it was he who had been unlawfully wounded by Harris. The original charge, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, was later amended to misdemeanor assault and battery.\n\nThe Post explains Crews' argument:\n\n\"In one piece of YouTube footage, Crews is clasping a large flagpole in front of a black protester, who is tugging on the other end. As the two of them tussle over the pole, Harris swings a flashlight at Crews, appearing to strike him on the head or shoulder. \"Moments later, several white nationalists \u2014 one of them dressed in military tactical gear and holding a plastic shield \u2014 storm into the garage, chasing Harris and forcing him to the ground, where he was brutally pummeled.\"\n\nHarris maintained that he had been swinging at Crews' flagpole, and ultimately, it was this argument Judge Robert Downer sided with, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove that Harris intended harm to Crews.\n\nAs for the crowd that stormed Harris immediately after that confrontation, beating him to the ground with poles in a parking garage, four men have been charged with felony assault or malicious wounding: Daniel Patrick Borden of Ohio, Jacob Scott Goodwin of Arkansas, Alex Michael Ramos of Georgia, and Tyler Watkins Davis of Florida.\n\nNone of the men has had his trial yet.\n\nDemonstrators gathered outside the courthouse in Charlottesville on Friday, showing their support for Harris. \"What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!\" the protesters shouted. \"If we can't get it, shut it down.\"\n\nThese cases represent just a fraction of the rally's legal fallout.\n\nAn independent review published in December found fault with Charlottesville police and other city authorities, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported. The violence revealed \"a failure of one of government's core functions \u2014 the protection of fundamental rights,\" the report asserted. \"Law enforcement also failed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm, injury, and death.\"\n\nAnd one of those fundamental rights, free speech, is the subject of a lawsuit filed recently against the organizers of the rally.\n\n\"We want to send a message that you can't do this,\" attorney Roberta Kaplan, who is representing the plaintiffs, told NPR's Rachel Martin on Friday.\n\n\"People are entitled to have their First Amendment beliefs in this country and to speak those beliefs,\" Kaplan continued, \"but what they're not allowed to do in this country is to plan, commit and then celebrate violence motivated by those beliefs.\"", "keywords": ["white", "black", "violence", "acquitted", "charlottesville", "rally", "assault", "crews", "beaten", "later", "man", "nationalist", "beliefs", "harris", "men"], "polarity": -0.08055555555555556, "subjectivity": 0.3284649632210609},

And federal officials deny allegations of retaliation.\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups say they have documented two dozen cases of immigrant activists and volunteers who say they have been arrested or face fines for their work.\n\nThey say many of the activists who are undocumented don't have criminal records and only came to the attention of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their activism.\n\nSee the list of the 20+ immigration activists arrested here.\n\n\"We're always at the marches and giving interviews, without fear of what could happen,\" says Zully Palacios Rodriguez, one of the activists caught by ICE. \"So to go against us is a way to intimidate the community.\"\n\nSeveral of the arrests have garnered national and international attention.\n\nTwo of the undocumented activists who have been arrested and put in deportation proceedings have filed First Amendment lawsuits claiming their free speech rights have been violated.\n\nIn one of those cases, the United Nations Office of Human Rights waded into the controversy, calling on the U.S. government \"to guarantee that no action, including detention and deportation, as a means of retaliation, is taken against\" the activist.\n\nOne of the groups crying foul is Migrant Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for dairy workers in Vermont. Six of its undocumented leaders have been arrested and face deportation.\n\nAt a recent protest against ramped-up deportations under President Trump, a dozen demonstrators stand amid piles of dirty snow in the town of Richford, Vt., not far from the Canada border.\n\nNational Immigrant Advocates Claim ICE Is Targeting And Deporting Them For Speaking Out Immigrant Advocates Claim ICE Is Targeting And Deporting Them For Speaking Out Listen \u00b7 5:36 5:36\n\nNational Activists: 1st Amendment Rights Of Undocumented Immigrants Are Often Violated Activists: 1st Amendment Rights Of Undocumented Immigrants Are Often Violated Listen \u00b7 3:23 3:23\n\n\"Not one more!

The agents investigated and learned that Palacios had overstayed a student visa, and that Balcazar had entered the country illegally from Mexico to work on dairy farms. Neither Palacios nor Balcazar have criminal records.\n\n\"There are six cases in particular where it's quite clear that the cause of the arrest was because of the members' leadership in the organization,\" says Will Lambek, national spokesman for the organization.\n\nHe ticks off reasons he believes the leaders were targeted. During one arrest, he says, federal agents warned that they'd be back to apprehend another Migrant Justice director.\n\nIn another arrest, ICE noted in the charging document that the subject \u2014 who had a DUI conviction \u2014 is \"a member and associate of Migrant Justice, a local immigrant advocate group.\"\n\nICE flatly denies that activists from Migrant Justice and other pro-immigrant groups are being singled out.\n\n\"ICE does not target unlawfully present aliens for arrest based on advocacy positions they hold or in retaliation for critical comments they make,\" Matthew Albence, executive associate director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. \"Any suggestion to the contrary is irresponsible, speculative and inaccurate.\n\n\"All those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention and ... removal from the United States.\"\n\nIn an email to NPR, an ICE spokesman for the region that includes Vermont, wrote: \"Professional activists string together tenuous pieces of information to justify their campaigning. The allegations are just wrong.\"\n\nDoris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Clinton and now senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, is skeptical that immigration agents would be picking on activists.\n\nShe points out that Trump has given ICE broad new authority to apprehend anybody they come across who's in the country unlawfully.\n\n\"Activists can be swept up in that, just like a variety of other groups that have been unprepared to face deportation,\" she says.\n\nYet, immigrant advocates point to what they call the hostile posture the administration has taken toward anyone standing in the way of its immigration clampdown.\n\n\"It's all of a piece with what this Homeland Security Department has been doing around the country,\" says Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU Immigrant Rights Project. \"You have the attorney general, the secretary of homeland security, and the acting director of ICE all making various threats to sanctuary cities and their officials.\"\n\nHe says it's not a stretch to think immigration agents would target anti-ICE activists who are in the country illegally.\n\nAmong the other cases of immigrant activists facing deportation is Maru Mora-Villalpando, who came from Mexico City to San Francisco in 1996 on a tourist visa, and overstayed. Villalpando became a well-known activist in the Northwest, regularly speaking out against ICE's detention policies.\n\nICE agents say she came to their attention when they read about her in the media accounts that indicated she was undocumented. In December, ICE sent her a letter telling her to appear before an immigration judge to face deportation. She didn't have a criminal record.\n\nIn her charging document, an ICE agent wrote: \"It should also be noted that she has extensive involvement with anti-ICE protests and Latino advocacy programs.\"\n\nThe case came to the attention of the U.N. human rights experts. They wrote in a statement: \"Ms. Villalpando's notice to appear at deportation proceedings, received without warning, seems to be related to her advocacy work on behalf of migrant detainees.\"\n\n\"My first sense was that ICE was trying to send me a signal to stop my work,\" Villalpando says from her home in Bellingham, Washington. \"The public needs to know what's going on.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Villalpando appeared in immigration court in Seattle to make her case before a judge.\n\nVillalpando also has a First Amendment lawsuit pending. The other suit was filed in the case of Ravi Ragbir, director of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City. He was taken into custody during an ICE check-in in January. ICE says he's in the country illegally, and he was once convicted of wire fraud.\n\nBut that crime was 17 years ago. And they put him into deportation proceedings two months ago.\n\nImmigration groups also point to eight members of a humanitarian group in Tucson called No More Deaths being charged with federal civil violations, such as entering a national wildlife refuge without a permit, and operating a motor vehicle in a wilderness area.\n\nThey are not undocumented immigrants. They are volunteers from all over the country who leave jugs of water in the desert for immigrants crossing the border illegally.\n\nArrests of Vermont dairy workers began in the Obama years, and they've accelerated under Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nAt the Richford protest, Balcazar, the Mexican immigrant arrested with Palacios, says the apprehensions of Migrant Justice leaders have sent a fresh chill through the immigrant community.\n\n\"They prefer to keep quiet,\" he says. \"They don't come out as much to our meetings and demonstrations. They prefer not to expose themselves and risk deportation.\"\n\nIndeed, the only Migrant Justice members to attend the meager protest at the health clinic were the leaders who'd already been arrested.\n\nSince its founding nine years ago, Migrant Justice has grown into a formidable advocate for the undocumented in Vermont. They pushed for drivers licenses for immigrants, and recently convinced Ben & Jerry's to improve working conditions in dairies.\n\nAt a recent city council meeting in tiny Winooski, Vt., you could witness the influence they wield.\n\nBalcazar drove here straight from the health clinic protest.\n\n\"We want to live in safety,\" he says to the council members. \"We're often forced to live in the shadows. We don't trust the police.\"\n\nHis organization wants to build on the success it has had on the state level. Migrant Justice was a major player behind the scenes when the Vermont Assembly passed a law last year that restricts local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Some now consider Vermont a sanctuary state.\n\nOn this night, activists and citizens have come to convince the city council to pass an even stricter ordinance to stop local police from dealing with ICE. They found a receptive audience.\n\n\"We are not going to utilize City of Winooski resources to grant access to those individuals who are in our custody to immigration enforcement authorities,\" says Councilor Eric Covey.\n\nAt the end of the public comments period, the council votes unanimously to adopt the measure proposed by Migrant Justice and the ACLU of Vermont.", "keywords": ["advocates", "warn", "activists", "justice", "immigrant", "deportation", "activism", "migrant", "undocumented", "country", "retaliating", "ice", "vermont", "immigration"], "polarity": -0.042456826327794066, "subjectivity": 0.35934103232490333},

Federal agents point out that he was convicted in 2001 of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for processing fraudulent mortgage applications. Ragbir, from Trinidad, was ordered to pay $350,000 in restitution and detained by ICE for two years while he was in deportation proceedings.

Berezovsky, who was also close to the poisoned former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, died in 2013, in what has been described as a hanging. All three men died in London.\n\nThe murder investigation into Glushkov's death is being announced days after Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russia of \"attempted murder\" in another case involving a high-profile Russian native living in the U.K.: former spy Sergei Skripal.\n\nSkripal was poisoned by an exotic and lethal Novichok nerve agent that is seen as Russia's sole property. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found on a bench at a shopping center in Salisbury, England. They remain in the hospital; a police officer who came to the scene is also receiving care.\n\nBecause of the attack on Skripal, the Met police's counterterrorism command took charge of the Glushkov inquiry.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest a link to the incident in Salisbury,\" police said as they announced the investigation into Glushkov's death earlier this week. On Friday, police clarified that stance a bit: \"At this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he was poisoned.\"\n\n\"Detectives are retaining an open mind,\" the police notice continued.

The investigative newsroom cited new clarifications from CIA insiders as the reason for its correction. It also issued an apology.\n\nFrom ProPublica:\n\n\"We at ProPublica hold government officials responsible for their missteps, and we must be equally accountable. \"This error was particularly unfortunate because it muddied an important national debate about Haspel and the CIA's recent history. To her, and to our readers, we can only apologize, correct the record and make certain that we do better in the future.\"\n\nPublished on Feb. 22, 2017, the ProPublica story was originally titled \"CIA Cables Detail Its New Deputy Director's Role in Torture.\" It cited criticism from two Democratic senators \"who have seen the still-classified records of [Haspel's] time in Thailand\" as well as declassified documents and books by \"officials involved in the CIA's interrogation program.\"\n\nThat ProPublica story is now prefaced by a lengthy introductory note from Editor-in-Chief Stephen Engelberg, who explains how a misunderstanding developed as ProPublica's journalists attempted to connect the dots between the inhumane treatment of Zubaydah and people in power at the CIA.\n\nPart of the problem, Engelberg said, lay in deciphering redacted accounts that were available \u2014 attaching identities to titles and blacked-out names, and confirming stories with sources wary of revealing classified information.\n\nProPublica moved to correct the record after James Mitchell, one of two psychologists who devised a program of harsh interrogation techniques for the CIA, told the Fox Business Network that he hadn't been referring to Haspel when he described a chief of the base in Thailand mocking prisoner's ordeal.\n\n\"That chief of base was not Gina,\" Mitchell said. \"She's not the COB I was talking about.\"\n\nProPublica had cited Mitchell's mention of the CIA leader in Thailand in its original report. But as Engelberg writes, the newsroom had erred by assuming Mitchell's use of two pronouns \u2014 she and he \u2014 was an attempt to preserve the chief of base's anonymity, rather than reading it as a reference to two different people. In actuality, the \"he\" referred to Haspel's male predecessor.\n\nWhen ProPublica asked the CIA about the allegations against Haspel last February, an agency spokesman didn't address the news group's questions individually. Instead, Engelberg said, there was a blanket response: \"Nearly every piece of the reporting that you are seeking comment on is incorrect in whole or in part.\"\n\nThat comment was quoted in the original article \u2014 but, Engelberg said in his correction note, \"In this instance, we failed to understand the message the CIA's press office was trying to convey in its statement.\"\n\nHe also quoted a new statement from Dean Boyd, director of the CIA's office of public affairs.\n\n\"It is important to note that she has spent nearly her entire CIA career undercover,\" Boyd said. \"Much of what is in the public domain about her is inaccurate. We are pleased that ProPublica is willing to acknowledge its mistakes and correct the record regarding its claims about Ms. Haspel.\"\n\nRevelation of the mistake put ProPublica in the unenviable position of a respected fact-checking organization acknowledging an error. Its reporting on Haspel had been cited by a number of media outlets \u2014 including NPR, which has collaborated with ProPublica on other stories in the past.\n\nProPublica says its original findings had been supported by a former CIA officer who said Haspel had overseen American staff at the Thai prison and by three former officials who said she had been the chief of base when Zubaydah was waterboarded. Crucial parts of the story were also corroborated by The New York Times, ProPublica says.\n\nThe story has made headlines in part because of public interest in Zubaydah \u2014 who lost his left eye while in U.S. custody and remains imprisoned at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay facility. But ProPublica also says Haspel was instrumental in the controversial decision to destroy recordings of Zubaydah's waterboarding. And it cites The New York Times' report of another detail that still seems to stand: that Haspel was running the CIA prison in 2002 when another detainee, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was waterboarded.\n\nThe year-old story about Haspel and Zubaydah rose to new prominence this week, as it was cited by people who say Haspel shouldn't be elevated to the role of leading the CIA.\n\nProPublica had tweeted a link to resurface its 2017 story on Tuesday morning, after President Trump nominated Haspel as director of the CIA, in the reshuffling that was set off by the firing of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul said he would \"do everything I can to block\" Haspel's nomination as director, as well as Trump's pick of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to lead the State Department. Paul cited Sen. John McCain, a noted opponent of the use of torture, who said the Senate must scrutinize Haspel's involvement \"in this disgraceful program.\"\n\nWhile ProPublica's retraction would seem to remove one of the most serious claims against Haspel, ProPublica reiterated that after she rose to a new position in the CIA, Haspel urged the agency to destroy 92 videotapes that had documented Zubaydah's treatment, including dozens of waterboardings and other techniques widely viewed as torture. Those tapes were eventually shredded.\n\nDespite ProPublica's correction, psychologist Mitchell says he is unsatisfied.\n\n\"They didn't go far enough,\" Mitchell told NPR's Ari Shapiro, in an interview to air on All Things Considered on Friday. \"They left in things that weren't accurate. Gina did not pressure Jose Rodriguez to destroy those tapes.\"\n\nMitchell says Rodriguez made that decision on his own, as the CIA's director of clandestine operations. By that time, Haspel had risen to become his chief of staff.\n\nIn its original story, ProPublica had quoted Rodriguez writing in his 2012 memoir, Hard Measures, \"My chief of staff drafted a cable approving the action we had been trying to accomplish for so long.\" He added, \"The cable left nothing to chance. It even told them how to get rid of the tapes. They were to use an industrial-strength shredder to do the deed.\"\n\nAri also spoke to Engelberg on Friday. The ProPublica leader said he feels that what happened in the newsroom's story about Haspel is not \"an acceptable outcome.\"\n\n\"When we cover medicine, we talk about what we call 'never events' \u2014 like, operating on the wrong limb. I believe in journalistic practice, this a 'never event.' This should never happen.\"\n\nEngelberg added, \"You've got to take stock, and you've got to try figure out what went wrong. I think there were things in this that I hope we learn.\"\n\nAs for the contentions about Rodriguez, not Haspel, being chiefly responsible for destroying the tapes, Engelberg said, \"I don't know, honestly, if we're ever going to get to the bottom of that one.\"\n\nNPR recently cited ProPublica's reporting in a story about Haspel's record and the renewal of the debate over torture. An editor's note has now been added to that story from Wednesday, and a line about her presence \"at a black site prison in Thailand\" has now been edited to remove a reference to Abu Zubaydah.\n\nNPR has also added a note and correction to an interview with the 2017 article's author, Raymond Bonner, that ran in Wednesday's All Things Considered. That segment also quoted Paul's contention that Haspel had expressed \"joyful glee at someone who's being tortured.\"\n\nDespite ProPublica's correction to its story, on Friday morning, Paul repeated his intention to oppose Haspel's rise to lead the CIA.\n\n\"Certainly there is a career officer at the CIA who did not directly participate in waterboarding that we could nominate,\" Paul said via Twitter, \"particularly picking and rewarding someone who was in charge of something so heinous, I think is a big mistake.\"", "keywords": ["gina", "haspels", "corrects", "cia", "nominee", "trumps", "chief", "zubaydah", "propublicas", "waterboarding", "thailand", "engelberg", "cited", "haspel", "propublica"], "polarity": 0.020073297914207002, "subjectivity": 0.49753418929555265},

Today, many of us celebrate by going out drinking and acting out the very stereotypes the day was created to combat.\n\nOn the other hand, 150 years ago nativists in the U.S. were burning Irish Catholic churches to the ground. Today on St. Patrick's Day, Americans of all backgrounds wear green, drink Guinness, and put on pins that say \"Kiss me I'm Irish.\" There's something beautiful about that.\n\nIn recent years, holidays associated with various other immigrant groups have begun to gain mainstream acceptance, most notably Cinco de Mayo, which has followed a similar path as St. Patrick's Day \u2013 started by activists to celebrate Mexican culture, embraced by people just looking for a good time.\n\nLunar New Year and Dia De Los Muertos are also well on their way.\n\nWhen one culture's holiday becomes everyone's excuse to party, what's gained and what's lost? And how does it feel when it's your holiday?\n\nTo find out, I go to a Chinese New Year party with no Chinese people and a Passover Seder with no Jewish people for this week's episode of The Sporkful podcast. Plus, comedian Jenny Yang offers advice for marketing new holidays:\n\nGentile Passover\n\n\"We're going to read from Exodus tonight,\" explains Tiffany Wang, as she welcomes me to Gentile Passover, an annual gathering she and her sister, Charlene Wang de Chen, host.\n\n\"We don't have a Haggada,\" Tiffany continues, referring to the book Jews use as a guide at Passover Seder, or ritual meal, \"but we know the Passover story because we grew up in a Christian household.\"\n\nThis Gentile Passover tradition began 10 years ago. Charlene was living in Beijing and read about how President Obama was hosting a Passover in the White House. She decided she'd host one, too, which is no surprise if you know how she and Tiffany were raised.\n\nThey're Chinese-American, but every St. Patrick's Day their mom made corned beef, potatoes and cabbage.\n\n\"We love eating,\" says Charlene, \"and we just love learning more about cultures through their food traditions. That's obviously the funnest way to learn about it.\"\n\nCharlene scrambled around Beijing to gather the symbolic foods needed for a Passover Seder \u2013 salt water for tears, bitter herbs for the bitterness of slavery, and of course, matzo (unleavened bread), because Jews were fleeing the Egyptians and didn't have time for our bread to rise. (That last item required a few phone calls to obtain.)\n\nThe first Gentile Passover was a big success.\n\n\"Everyone was so down for it, on an occasion none of them traditionally celebrate, which I thought was awesome,\" Charlene recalls. \"Everyone was bringing this openness.\"\n\nWhen I joined last year's Gentile Passover, I was the only Jewish person in the room. We were joined by Charlene's husband, Tony Chen, Tiffany's fianc\u00e9, and two friends, Tim Cotton and Anne-Laure Py.\n\nThey proudly showed me the two different types of matzo they had purchased, and served me a delicious cocktail made with Campari and Manischewitz, the latter being a Jewish ceremonial wine that is the best wine because it's filled with sugar.\n\nThe cocktail was fantastic, and the menu looked promising. Tiffany and Charlene had prepared matzo ball soup and short ribs, which made me very happy, because I've long advocated replacing the more traditional brisket with short ribs at Passover and all year round.\n\nThere was a beautiful Seder plate, and even though I'm not especially religious myself, I was very impressed with the research and work they had done to respect the holiday's customs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Pashman/NPR Dan Pashman/NPR\n\nI did cringe a bit when they told me they had rugelach, a Jewish pastry, for dessert. Most Jews would not serve rugelach at Passover because it contains leavened bread. Charlene and Tiffany knew that, but, they said, rugelach is delicious. I couldn't argue with that.\n\nWe read the story of the Jews being freed from slavery in Egypt, as recounted in Exodus, and dinner was served. We skipped rituals like dipping parsley in salt water and putting bitter herbs on matzo. And that felt strange.\n\nAt my family's Passover Seder, we use a Haggada written by my wife, Janie, that I love very much. But the part of it I know best is page 21. Because page 21 is where it says, \"Dinner is served.\" From the time we open that book I keep thinking, \"Please get me to page 21!\"\n\nIn other words, I'm often eager to rush through the rituals. At Gentile Passover, I found myself missing them. It turns out those traditions mean more to me than I realized.\n\nAnd while the experience of watching people who aren't Jewish observe their version of customs I grew up with was in some ways strange and unsettling, it was also beautiful.\n\nI wondered about what my great-grandparents, who came to America from Eastern Europe, would think if they saw me celebrating Passover with two Chinese-American Christians, a Chinese-born Muslim, a Sri Lankan-American, and two white European Christians.\n\nThe meal itself was fantastic. The matzo balls were just the right combo of soft on the outside and firm inside, and the short ribs braised in charoset were savory and sweet, reaffirming my belief in their superiority over brisket.\n\nOne key Passover tradition is that you're supposed to ask questions \u2013 big questions like \"What's the point of all this?\" After the meal I asked everyone, when we celebrate other people's holidays, what's gained and what's lost?\n\n\"We're trying to understand other cultures, but in doing that and changing it, you dilute them,\" says Charlene and Tiffany's friend Tim. \"A more pure and authentic Seder would be less accessible to me, who's not Jewish. So this is more accessible to me, but it also does change it. So there's a tension there. While it's very positive that we learn all these things, I can see why some people get worried that if you do that to the final degree, it ceases to exist as its own tradition and it becomes this amorphous globalized thing that doesn't really mean anything.\"\n\n\"Something I've thought about for a long time is, How Chinese are my kids going to be?\" adds Tiffany. \"And the answer is, less than me. And I'm less than my parents. I'm going to marry a Sri Lankan man. My children are going to be Chinese and Sri Lankan, and very American at the same time. So there will be a dilution of our culture. That can feel like something you can mourn. But then whatever we create from that may also be something new and exciting.\"\n\nDan Pashman hosts the James Beard Award-nominated food podcast The Sporkful, which this week features the episode \"Other People's Holidays.\" It's available in Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever you listen.", "keywords": ["charlene", "matzo", "im", "tiffany", "holidays", "seder", "whats", "excuse", "passover", "party", "jewish", "going", "cultures"], "polarity": 0.1609808832122882, "subjectivity": 0.3886656410623352},

Mukhin is about to serve a 13-course tasting menu with dishes like lardo made from strips of coconut, scallops with something called eucalyptus snow on top and homemade black bread with three types of caviar.\n\nMukhin owns more than 20 restaurants, mostly in Russia, including Chef's Table.\n\nBut his most famous space is called White Rabbit, named one of the world's 50 best restaurants last year. It's an over-the-top, multi-level glass atrium at the top of a skyscraper. The furniture is upholstered in lush suede; there are velvet pillows everywhere, jewel-toned accents and paintings of anthropomorphized white rabbits in royal regalia. It's like Alice in Wonderland meets Imperial Russia.

The Soviet period was gray. Everything was gray. Everybody was gray.\"\n\nHe says that Soviet food was heavy, drab and smothered in mayonnaise. Fresh ingredients were rare. Food was just sustenance, nothing to be celebrated.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jolie Myers/NPR Jolie Myers/NPR\n\nBut there were vestiges of pre-Soviet cooking where Mukhin grew up.

He even bought farms so that he could grow whatever he wanted.\n\nBut high-end Russian cuisine wasn't an easy sell to the urbane population of Moscow. The sophisticated set dined at French, Japanese and Italian restaurants.\n\nThen help arrived in the most unlikely way \u2014 through sanctions. In 2014, the Russian army invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The U.S. and its NATO allies responded by slapping sanctions on Russia.

Because we have beautiful milk, why can't we make the cheese here? That's why my idea is: We must grow Russian cuisine.\"\n\nAnd he's taken that idea on the road. Mukhin's been all over the world preaching the gospel of Russian cuisine. He recently caught up with a barbecue chef in Dallas.\n\nMukhin tried American-style coleslaw while in that Texas city and was not impressed.

McMaster is expected to depart his White House position soon, U.S. officials tell NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Despite a denial from the Trump administration, the only thing that is reportedly holding up McMaster's departure is a transition plan.\n\nMcMaster's exit has been the subject of rumors, in a similar way that outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been viewed as not long for life under President Trump. Officials say McMaster, 55, could leave within weeks, possibly within a month or so.\n\n\"We don't get a sense of when this will happen,\" Tom says, \"but we're told it will likely happen.\"\n\nInformation about Trump's desire to replace McMaster has been solidified by sources, despite a denial from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who tweeted Thursday night that she had just spoken to Trump and McMaster and that \"contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC [National Security Council].\"\n\n\"Trump has publicly said that he respects H.R. McMaster, but their relationship has not been an easy one,\" Tom tells NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. \"There were some policy differences: H.R. favored an enduring commitment in Afghanistan, he served there for a time and actually wanted more troops sent over there. Others in the White House disagreed with that.\"\n\nAs for any possible personal rift between Trump and McMaster, Tom says, \"People in the Army say he's 'all transmit,' as they would put it: He likes to lecture.

In early 2017, reports cited McMaster's reluctance to take the position \u2014 and when he finally did take the job, McMaster retained his active-duty status as a lieutenant general in the Army.\n\nTom says that he was told that while McMaster's departure is definite, the timing is uncertain \u2014 possibly within a month or two, officials said. But as Tom adds, \"With this White House, with the president tweeting, it could happen today.

Jim Justice signed a law giving educators a 5 percent pay increase, but the fight in other states is just warming up.\n\n\"You can make anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 more by driving 15 minutes across the state line,\" said Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association. \"We're having trouble keeping and attracting young teachers.\"\n\nAnd this refrain is not new or unique to West Virginia.\n\nThe ink had barely dried in West Virginia before teachers in Oklahoma made it clear they too could walk out if lawmakers don't find a way to raise their pay and school spending.\n\nIn recent years, thousands of public school teachers in Oklahoma have crossed state lines for better pay.\n\n\"It's gotten so bad that the state Department of Education has had to issue emergency teacher certifications to replace teachers as quickly as possible,\" reported Emily Wendler of member station KOSU in July. \"Across the state, textbooks are out-of-date, electives have been eliminated and support positions are being terminated left and right.\"\n\nEven Shawn Sheehan, a math teacher in Norman, Okla., and the state's 2016 teacher of the year, decided he simply couldn't afford to stay. So he moved his family to Texas.\n\n\"Sure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but I would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400,\" Sheehan told Wendler. \"[Moving] feels good because I know I'm doing the right thing for my family, but it also feels sad.\"\n\nThis got us wondering: What do teachers make across the country?\n\nWhen people (not just teachers and politicians, but reporters, too) talk about average salaries, they often use numbers that haven't been adjusted for regional differences in cost of living. Clearly, the costs of life \u2014 from rents and mortgages to movies, food and day care \u2014 vary widely, depending on where we live. Without adjusting for that, comparing teachers' salaries in New York to, say, California is classic apples to oranges.\n\nSure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but I would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400.\n\nThat is why we reached out to EdBuild, to see whether they could help bring more clarity to the conversation about teacher salaries. The education nonprofit has previously used data to map the nation's 50 most segregating school borders.\n\nBelow, you can see what teachers in each state and Washington, D.C., make before \u2014 and after \u2014 adjusting for regional cost differences. EdBuild used 2015-16 average teacher salaries as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics and a cost-of-living index produced by the Council for Community and Economic Research. Before we get into the numbers, a few quick caveats: There is obviously wide variation in the costs of living within states, too, that these numbers can't clearly capture. In some cases, deep pockets of veteran teachers may also conceal low pay for young teachers. If you're curious to know what states pay their starting teachers, EdBuild has looked at that, too.\n\nYou can see, with the adjustment in cost of living, some interesting things happen to the rankings:\n\nOklahoma ranks 49th in average teacher salary but jumps to 40th. Still low, to be sure, and cold comfort to Oklahoma teachers, but it's nuance worth knowing.\n\nWest Virginia is less mobile, moving from 46th to 43rd.\n\nMississippi lands next to last in average salary but rockets up to 37th after the adjustment.\n\nAt first, Indiana and California appear light-years apart, paying $50,715 and $72,842 respectively. But the cost of living adjustment, which favors relatively low-cost Indiana, brings the two states' salaries to within $100.\n\nHawaii offers a similar tale of two salaries.

It's also coming to an airport near you.\n\nAt Orlando International Airport, Britain-bound passengers \u2014 some wearing Mickey Mouse T-shirts and other Disney paraphernalia \u2014 lined up at Gate 80 recently for the evening British Airways flight to London's Gatwick Airport. It looks like any other airport departure area, except for the two small gates with what look like small boxes on posts next to them. Those boxes are actually cameras.\n\nThey were installed this month by SITA, the Geneva-based company that develops information technology for the world's airlines, in conjunction with British Airways and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP.\n\nSherry Stein, a senior manager at SITA, says the cameras are triggered when passengers step onto designated footprints. \"We collect a photo, send it to CBP, who checks to make sure that person is booked on the manifest and matches the photo that they already have on file.\" If everything matches, Stein says, \"we open the doors and give them the OK to board.\" All that happens, she says, \"in three to five seconds.\"\n\nIf things don't match, the traveler's passport is scanned manually by a gate agent.\n\ntoggle caption Brian Naylor/NPR\n\nCBP is testing biometric scanning at a dozen or so U.S. international airports to ensure that people leaving the country are who they say they are, and to prevent visa overstays. The Transportation Security Administration, another agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is testing similar devices at security check-in lines.\n\nSteve Karoly, acting assistant administrator at TSA, calls the use of biometrics \"a game changer\" for the aviation security. \"It will make things a little bit easier, more efficient at an airport environment,\" he says. Karoly predicts it will be a few more years before biometrics are in widespread use by TSA.\n\nCritics like Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law School say the technology now isn't ready for prime time. Rudolph, co-author of a report released by the center in December, considers the system \"riddled with legal and technical problems.\"\n\nAmong the problems he cites is bias. \"DHS doesn't seem to know whether its system will falsely reject folks,\" that is, be unable to match the face scan with photos it has in the system, at higher rates because of their race or gender. \"That's a serious problem,\" he says.\n\nAccording to a report by the CAPA-Centre for Aviation, face-recognition software \"is not so good at identifying ethnic minorities when most of the subjects used in training the technology were from the majority group.\" Another problem are passengers who are wearing glasses, hats or scarves.\n\nRudolph says about 4 percent of travelers are wrongly rejected by the system.\n\nAnother concern he has: He says privacy protections are nonexistent.\n\n\"DHS hasn't issued a single rule under this program to protect Americans' privacy,\" Rudolph says. \"So what DHS decides to do with this information tomorrow, I'm not sure. And without rules there may be few protections for Americans' privacy.\"\n\nCBP says it deletes the photos taken at airport gates within 14 days. Sean Farrell, director of strategy and innovation at SITA, says travelers seem to be comfortable with the new technology. \"We haven't seen that privacy as being a major concern for passengers,\" Farrell says. \"They seem to actually embrace this technology and are willing to provide a biometric in order to get the benefit of an improved boarding process.\"\n\nMany travelers in Orlando whom NPR spoke with said they were happy with the process, although there was some grumbling by those at the end of the boarding queue.\n\nComfortable or not, travelers should probably get used to the technology.

Since then, a number of other aid groups have come clean about similar problems \u2014 and revealed cases that victimized staffers as well.\n\nThis past week, U2 frontman Bono said he was \"furious\" over allegations against his ONE advocacy group \u2014 including an accusation that a female employee was demoted after refusing to have sex with a Tanzanian member of parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, the aid world is scrambling to put solutions in place.\n\nHere are some of the latest developments.\n\nThe cost for Oxfam Great Britain\n\nOxfam continues to deal with the fallout of the Oxfam Great Britain sex scandal.\n\nA spokesperson said on March 9 that Oxfam, which has more than 9,000 staff in more than 90 countries, investigated 42 allegations of sexual misconduct in 2017.\n\nLate last month, the Haitian government suspended Oxfam Great Britain for two months while it investigates how the charity handled the local case. Oxfam Great Britain's future government funding is also at risk. \"Oxfam has agreed to withdraw from bidding for any new UK Government funding until DFID is satisfied that they can meet the high standards we expect of our partners,\" Britain's international development secretary Penny Mordaunt said in a statement.\n\nIn the last financial year, Oxfam GB received $44 million in funding from the UK's Department for International Development.\n\nRevelations and resignations\n\nBut the Oxfam scandal is now just one in an ever-growing list.\n\nThe allegations of sexual abuse by humanitarian workers and U.N. peacekeepers include inappropriate conduct among staffers as well as toward local populations. But it's the latter scandals that are raising the deepest sense of outrage.\n\n\"When we go to work in these countries where there is no infrastructure and we're supposed to be there to help facilitate, the rule of law and order and instead we're taking advantage of that vacuum \u2014 that to me is the absolute worst offense,\" Dina Francesca Haynes, who has worked for the U.N. refugee agency in Croatia and for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, told NPR.\n\nLast month, 46 U.N. peacekeepers were recalled from their post in Wau, South Sudan, after allegations that some of them had engaged in transactional sex. \"This is a clear breach of the U.N. and UNMISS Code of Conduct which prohibits sexual relationships with vulnerable individuals, including all beneficiaries of assistance,\" the U.N. Mission in South Sudan said in a statement.\n\nA U.N. Population Fund report published in November 2017 is getting renewed attention. It's titled \"Voices from Syria 2018\" and includes descriptions of the sexual exploitation that some women and girls in Syria said they faced during aid distributions. During focus group discussions, some participants said aid workers would \"make sexual advances on women and girls in exchange for goods or services necessary for survival.\" As a result, some women and girls said they would only go to distribution sites with a chaperone, the report states.\n\nThe aid organization Plan International said on Feb. 21 that it had six confirmed cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by staff or associates from July 2016 to June 2017, as well as nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by staff involving adults.\n\nIn a statement, the group said it reports details of criminal instances to law enforcement agencies but would not reveal details to the public \"due to the sensitive nature of the information.\"\n\nIn the cases involving children, the organization says it \"linked victims and families with local support networks including but not limited to medical and psychosocial support.\"\n\nThe Red Cross director said in a statement Feb. 23 that since 2015, a total of 21 Red Cross employees have either been dismissed for paying for \"sexual services\" or resigned while an internal inquiry was in progress.\n\nHigh-profile resignations are also in the news. Last month, Justin Forsyth resigned from his role as UNICEF's deputy executive director after allegations arose of inappropriate behavior while he was working for Save the Children, which said in a statement: \"In 2011 and 2015, concerns were raised about inappropriate behavior and comments\" by Forsyth. Three female employees made complaints, the organization noted.\n\nAlso in February, Brendan Cox resigned from two charities he helped to start. One of them, the Jo Cox Foundation, announced on Feb. 17 that it had accepted his resignation. On Feb. 18, Save the Children said in a statement that Cox was accused of inappropriate behavior while working for that group in 2015. At the time, Cox was suspended and a disciplinary process began, but he resigned before it was completed, the organization said. Cox has also been accused of assaulting a woman at Harvard University in 2015. He tweeted an apology.\n\nFixing the problem\n\nHow do you stop such behavior?\n\nThat's the question now facing aid organizations and development experts.\n\nThe operative word is \"safeguarding\" \u2013 the term used by the aid community. It means that groups should have systems in place to prevent abuse and misconduct.\n\nAt the safeguarding summit held on March 5 in London, Britain's secretary for international development Penny Mordaunt said the government will put safeguarding standards in place that organizations must meet in order to be funded.\n\n\"These standards will include an assessment of codes of conduct, how organizations identify and respond to incidents and how their risk management places safeguarding and beneficiaries at the very core,\" Mordaunt said. \"Organizations should not bid for new funding unless they are prepared to meet these tough new standards.\"\n\nLindsay Coates, president of InterAction, an alliance of nearly 200 U.S.-based nonprofits that do international work, is calling for three key areas of focus: taking complaints seriously and responding to the complainants, making sure these individuals have access to services, and pushing anyone who is \"predatory\" out of the system.\n\n\"We're not fixing anything if someone who works for the U.N. goes to [a nongovernmental organization/aid group] and there's no communication between the U.N. and the NGO,\" Coates says.\n\nOxfam has developed a list of steps the organization plans to take in response to the \"crisis.\" On Thursday, it announced the leaders of its new Independent Commission on Sexual Misconduct, Accountability and Culture Change. Among other measures, Oxfam said it has \"committed to work with others in the sector on a humanitarian passporting system that would stop offenders from moving from one organization to another.\"\n\nThat idea of a \"passport\" issued to all aid workers is still very much a work in progress. Basically, all employees would have a permanent record of infractions.\n\nSave the Children also included the passport on a list of proposed steps to address concerns about the aid sector, published on Feb. 12.\n\n\"Any staff members reprimanded or dismissed for sexual harassment, bullying and a failure of protection are identified and cannot disappear back into the system,\" the organization writes. \"Establishing a common registry and passport system would identify if all necessary background checks have been carried out and retain details of all previous conduct.\"\n\nThe passport is just one of many proposals. Dorothea Hilhorst, a professor of humanitarian aid and reconstruction at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, published a commentary suggesting the revival of the idea of a humanitarian ombudsperson.\n\n\"An ombudsperson investigates, makes recommendations, and then it is up to the organization to act on those recommendations,\" she says. \"An ombudsperson works best if (s)he is independent, yet is installed by and funded by member organizations from the sector under scrutiny.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. Dina Francesca Haynes, director of the Human Rights and Immigration Law Project at the New England School of Law, says there are too many variables.\n\n\"Who would fund this? Who would appoint? Would donors balk that money was directed here, rather than to supplies in the field?\" she wrote in an email to NPR.\n\nMeanwhile, the organization that brought this story into the headlines, Oxfam, is not just being criticized.\n\nA group of 14 Honduran nonprofits teamed up for an expression of solidarity published on Feb. 22. \"We recognize the great contributions Oxfam has provided in Honduras since 1998, with its humanitarian response to Hurricane Mitch,\" the organizations wrote in Spanish.\n\nAnd Oxfam is pledging to do better: \"Oxfam is rightly under close scrutiny by many people today around the world. We hope that our apologies \u2014 but far more importantly our deeds and the steps we are taking \u2014 will begin to restore people's trust in us,\" Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam International's executive director, said in a statement.\n\nCourtney Columbus is a multimedia journalist who covers science, global health and consumer health.

She called in a prescription for an antifungal medicine to a specialty pharmacy with mail-order services that would send it to Soloviev's Capitol Hill home.\n\nIt seemed like an easy fix to an inconsequential health issue. \"I did not ask how much it cost \u2014 it never crossed my mind, ever,\" said Soloviev, a former French teacher, who still works part time.\n\nThen the bill came.\n\nPatient: Anne Soloviev, 76, of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe bill: $1,496.09 for Kerydin, a topical medication that treats toenail fungus. Originally produced by Anacor Pharmacueticals, the drug is now a product of Sandoz, a division of Novartis.\n\nService provider: My Express Care Pharmacy, plus Braun Dermatology and Skin Cancer Center\n\nMedical treatment: The antifungal medicine arrived by overnight mail, and an automatic refill came a few weeks later. She began using it on the two toenails, as directed, having been told it would take about 11 months to treat her feet.\n\nShe thought little of it.\n\nSoloviev, a widow, has robust insurance. She is covered by Medicare, parts A and B, and has supplemental insurance through her late husband's government health benefits that covers prescription drugs. She also has a health reimbursement account, which receives almost $1,500 pre-tax each year to pay for uncovered medical expenses. She typically uses the HRA money to cover copays for the other medicines she takes regularly.\n\nBut when Soloviev went to her local CVS to pick up another medication \u2014 a cholesterol-lowering statin that is usually paid for by her HRA \u2014 she discovered her reserve was empty.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, the Kerydin charges had wiped out her entire health reimbursement account.\n\nWhat gives: According to Leslie Pott, Sandoz vice president of communications, Kerydin is patent-protected and priced \"at parity\" with its one market competitor, Jublia. She also pointed out that to secure a place on an insurer's list of approved drugs \u2014 its formulary \u2014 the company often had to offer substantial discounts to insurers and various middlemen. \"We have no visibility into the extent to which these discounts are passed onto patients or payers,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nIn the application for Food and Drug Administration approval granted in 2014, Anacor Pharmaceuticals highlighted that a year-long treatment of Kerydin completely cured toe fungus in 6.5 percent of patients for one trial and in 9.1 percent of patients in another.\n\nThere are many treatment options for toenail fungus \u2014 both older medicines in pill form and newer topical treatments such as Kerydin, said Dr. Shari Lipner, an assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York and director of its nail unit. The patient in this case would have been a candidate for \"quite a few\" of them.\n\nPatients are likely to pay less for the pills, she said, and they also seem to have greater efficacy. Health plans also are less likely to cover the newer treatments, such as Kerydin. If they do, they often require patients to try the less expensive options first.\n\nAfter a proper diagnosis based on a nail clipping or scraping, Lipner said, patients should be offered all the options and be counseled about their proper use. For example, the oral treatments usually last three months while the topical medicines must be used for a year. And, especially for the newer ones, like Kerydin, insurance coverage can be limited. Cost is likely to be something patients will want to consider, Lipner said.\n\nThe Bill Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Anne Soloviev Courtesy of Anne Soloviev\n\nXavier Davis, Braun Dermatology and Skin Cancer Center's practice manager, said a drug's price tag simply isn't a factor when prescribers recommend a course of treatment.\n\n\"When our providers are treating patients, we're not treating them based on what the cost's going to be. We look for what's the best care for the patient,\" Davis said. \"If the patient calls and says that's too expensive, then we'll look for alternatives.\"\n\nBut patients often don't see the actual price until it's too late.\n\nIn January, Soloviev's insurance plan was billed the full price of Kerydin. Of that, $1,439.57 came from her HRA. The difference, $56.52, was covered by a patient-assistance program from the drug manufacturer, explained Jonathan Lee, a pharmacist for My Express Care.\n\nIn February, when her prescription was refilled, Soloviev's plan was again billed the full price. But she didn't know about that either. A manufacturer coupon was applied to cover what remained of her insurer's $2,000-annual deductible and the $60 copay. Her insurance then kicked in to pay the difference.\n\nCVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit manager that administers the drug coverage for Soloviev's plan, said it was structured to pay for such an expense automatically, using the HRA. Had the HRA been structured differently, the coupon may have covered more of the costs upfront, said company spokeswoman Christine Cramer.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee, the pharmacist, said even he didn't realize that money could be withdrawn directly from a patient's HRA without her knowledge.\n\n\"I just find it is outrageous for a fungal medicine to cost $1,400, to be prescribed for 11 months, and for neither the P.A. nor the pharmacy to warn you,\" Soloviev said.\n\nResolution: Although Soloviev told My Express Care not to renew the prescription, her HRA is depleted. For the rest of the year, she'll have to pay out-of-pocket costs for any other medications, an expense she hadn't planned on.\n\nThe takeaway: Medical professionals should talk with patients about the options for treatment and what the costs will be. That is especially true if they are recommending a high-priced medicine.\n\nPatients should take nothing for granted and ask about the cost of every new prescription. And, because costs can vary depending on coverage, they may need to contact their insurance carrier or the pharmacy benefits manager that handles their medicine claims. Finally, patients should ask again at the pharmacy \u2013 even if that means calling a mail-order pharmacy. It never hurts to ask whether there are generic or over-the-counter alternatives.\n\nThis is a monthly feature from Kaiser Health News and NPR that dissects and explains real medical bills to shed light on prices in U.S. health care and to help patients learn how to be more active in managing costs.

It was late 2014 and she kept seeing advertisements in her social media feed geared to young, educated Russians looking to work in a creative field. A friend who worked at the troll factory tipped her off to what the ads were for. That same friend put in a good word for Savchuk with her bosses.\n\n\"My friend taught me the ropes. She told me that I had to write posts that were natural \u2014 like, for example, 'I am cooking or I am walking down the street and I had this thought about how bad the [pro-Western] Ukrainian president is.' \"\n\nAccording to Savchuk, there were a few hundred people in the building at any given time, and the average pay started at $400 a month. The trolls were divided into groups. Those with the best English skills posed as Americans and created accounts on Facebook and Twitter. They'd use those troll accounts to stir up trouble on subjects such as U.S. elections or race relations.\n\nSavchuk, who considers herself a freelance investigative journalist and activist for free and fair elections, spent most of her time at the troll farm writing as an imaginary Russian woman on the LiveJournal blogging platform, widely used in Russia today. Her posts were meant for Russian readers and were intended to inflame anti-American feelings.\n\n\"We made up a post about a new computer game created in the States \u2014 that even kids loved to play \u2014 and the theme of the game was slavery,\" she says. \"And this was to stir negative tensions towards Americans, as the creators of this game.\"\n\nThat game never existed. Nor did the woman that Savchuk was posing as. A day at the troll factory could mean multiple layers of trolling subterfuge.\n\nEach troll was given a list of topics to focus on by a supervisor. She says there were usually about 10 topics on the list. The United States, the European Union and Putin never left the list.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jolie Myers/NPR Jolie Myers/NPR\n\n\"It is laughable when Putin says that we do not know about trolls or trolls do not exist,\" she says, \"because when anyone looks thorough the Kremlin-controlled newspapers or state TV, they can see that the propaganda in that media is the exact same stuff that the trolls are posting.\"\n\nSavchuk worries about the deleterious effect of so much fake information on Russian society.\n\n\"For the public, it is harmful because we are being brainwashed,\" she says. \"We won't be able to understand what is really happening. We are put against one another, and we are sliding back into the old ways when we were searching for the enemy among us \u2014 our friends and colleagues. That feeling from the Soviet times \u2014 I can feel it everywhere.\"\n\nSavchuk eventually leaked documents, videos and her story to the independent Russian news outlet Moy Rayon in 2015. And then the trolls and state-controlled media came after her.\n\n\"They said that I am a secret agent, a CIA operative, and that I am a pervert,\" she says. \"This is what they usually do. So I was ready for this.\"\n\nShe says she ignored the trolls and hoped that her reporting spoke for itself.\n\nShe says that the charges against the 13 employees of the Internet Research Agency are her answer to those allegations.\n\nSavchuk says she worked with several of the 13 troll factory people named in the Mueller indictment and was elated when she heard that workers and managers at the factory had been indicted.\n\n\"This was really a good sign,\" she says. \"We should continue to add more names to this list. I think that every single propagandist, even the little troll on Facebook, has to be punished, has to be named and exposed.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Anna Shpakova contributed to this story.", "keywords": ["uncovered", "trolls", "savchuk", "jolie", "troll", "building", "probe", "activist", "named", "factory", "worked", "russians", "russian", "media", "meet", "mueller"], "polarity": -0.003477591529917107, "subjectivity": 0.3136155156213295},

David Ake/AP J. David Ake/AP\n\nUpdated at 3:45 p.m. ET\n\nA conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is turning its attention to a new front: promoting federal judges at the grass-roots level. Americans for Prosperity is willing to spend nearly $1 million to confirm judges this year. Those lifetime appointments could reshape the courts for a generation.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that so much of what affects us in our daily lives plays out in the courtroom,\" said Sarah Field, the group's new vice president for judicial strategy.\n\nBut even more important than the money could be the firepower AFP wants to engage. The idea is to mobilize conservative activists across 36 states for key confirmation fights this year. That includes people who call their home-state senators, write letters and knock on doors.\n\nFor now, ground zero is in Wisconsin, where AFP state director Eric Bott said it's a little too cold to knock on doors just yet. Bott said his network of 130,000 volunteers has rallied for Tea Party causes, supported Republican Gov. Scott Walker and fought for limits on the state's collective bargaining laws. Now, those volunteers are turning their attention to judges.\n\n\"A lot of our activists are really looking for certain types of jurists,\" he said. \"They want a judge who's going to respect the rule of law. They're looking for a judge who's going to interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended.\"\n\nAFP has already thrown its support behind one of President Trump's judge picks this year \u2014 Michael Brennan, a Milwaukee lawyer and ally of Gov. Walker.\n\nWisconsin's Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, refused to turn in a blue slip for Brennan. The blue slip is a way for senators to signal support for a nominee. Withholding that paperwork usually means the end of a nomination, as Baldwin noted in a letter earlier this year.\n\n\"President Trump's nomination of Mr. Brennan disregards the longstanding, bipartisan process in Wisconsin that has informed the selection of federal judges in my state,\" Baldwin said. \"This is a particularly troubling step at a time when institutions and traditions of democracy seem under constant attack, and bipartisanship feels like a fading concept.\"\n\nBut the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, broke with 100 years of tradition and held a hearing for Brennan anyway. Last month, Brennan advanced out of the committee on a party-line vote of 11 to 10. He's waiting for action by the full Senate.\n\nAFP is buying digital ads to encourage a quick vote.\n\n\"This is a seat that has been vacant longer than any other seat on the federal bench and the people of Wisconsin deserve to see a judge confirmed on the 7th Circuit,\" said Sarah Field of AFP.\n\nKristine Lucius of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that's not the full story. Lucius pointed out that the current nominee, Michael Brennan, wrote an opinion piece supporting Republican efforts to block President Obama's pick for that same job. The delay strategy worked.\n\n\"And to think that that person who defended that right would now enjoy the nomination and be critical of the other senator who is exercising her own rights is the epitome of hypocrisy,\" she added.\n\nLucius now fights against many of Trump's selections for the federal courts. But she said she understands why AFP is stepping up its role.\n\n\"To me it's not surprising that the Koch brothers, billionaire corporate leaders, would want to invest their money in the fight to get judges to uphold their corporate rights,\" Lucius said. \"They think this is money well spent because they are trying to tilt the bench. They are trying not to have rule of law that rules against them, but instead they want to get more people into lifetime positions that will rule in favor of corporate interests over individual interests.\"\n\nJudges confirmed to lifetime posts already represent one of the president's most important accomplishments. And groups on both ends of the political spectrum know that other big fights are on the way.\n\nFrom her headquarters in Virginia, Sarah Field of AFP says she's gearing up.\n\n\"Everything that we're doing is really pointing to the future of the Supreme Court,\" Field said.\n\nUnlike some other conservative groups, AFP intends to make federal judges a focus of its permanent grass-roots efforts.\n\nEditor's note: Koch Industries, though not the Koch brothers' PAC, has been a sponsor of NPR.", "keywords": ["wisconsin", "activists", "judges", "mobilize", "trumps", "afp", "field", "sarah", "judge", "federal", "koch", "conservatives", "promote", "trump", "grassroots", "brennan"], "polarity": 0.11333732057416271, "subjectivity": 0.41753626490468604}
