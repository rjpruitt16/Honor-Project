College-educated suburbanites outside Philadelphia are angry at Mr. Trump and in a mood to send him a message. And blue-collar voters in western Pennsylvania are suddenly up for grabs, after they turned out strongly in the special election this month to elect a moderate young Democrat, Conor Lamb, over a Republican who ran as a wingman to the president.\n\nIn the Philadelphia suburbs, three Republican incumbents who have seen the writing on the wall are retiring, and a fourth is stepping down after a sexual harassment scandal. The latest to retire is Representative Ryan Costello, who announced his decision over the weekend, citing the difficulty of being heard over the cacophony from the White House.\n\nThe shifts outside Philadelphia mirror changes in suburbs around the country, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and behavior have pushed away college-educated voters. The Pew Research Center reported this week that more voters with a four-year college degree now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic \u2014 54 percent \u2014 than at any time since 1994.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s suburbs were once so reliably Republican that Ronald Reagan\u2019s cabinet included three residents of Montgomery County alone. But the region\u2019s allegiance began to shift as well-educated and culturally liberal voters came to predominate in the suburbs in the 1990s.\n\nThe tide was held back in the last decade by gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Republicans to protect their candidates. But that map was thrown out by the state court in January, and Republicans lost appeals to have the United States Supreme Court intervene. The state's new districts hew more compactly to county and town boundaries.\n\nTwo nonpartisan handicappers of House races, the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, now rate four Republican-held seats in the Philadelphia suburbs as either \u201csolidly\u201d Democratic, \u201clikely\u201d to fall into the party\u2019s hands, or \u201cleaning\u201d that way. The chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, Val DiGregorio, declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is a big wave coming our way,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican from the Lehigh Valley north of Philadelphia, who is not running for re-election. \u201cI\u2019d get off the beach.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a record of attracting crossover votes from Democrats and enjoys the advantages of incumbency but is in his first term. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get incumbents, you typically knock them off in their first term,\u201d Mr. Gerow said.\n\nAt the other end of the state, Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, is running his second race of the year, this time in a new district against an incumbent, Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican who was once paired by a political blog in a celebrity look-alike feature with the cartoon character Milhouse.\n\nThe new district, the 17th, is more evenly balanced in its partisan leanings than the former 18th District, where Mr. Lamb won his upset victory in part by reawakening dormant Democratic DNA in white working-class voters who had supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rothfus, by contrast, is \u201cseveral clicks to the right\u201d of his new district, according to one Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess the race.\n\nAnother Republican who was shifted to a more competitive district is Representative Scott Perry, who represents Harrisburg and York in central Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry is the only member of the far-right Freedom Caucus in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Mr. Trump won his old district by 21 percentage points; the new map places him in territory the president carried by only nine.\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Perry. Republicans predominate in the new district, but one strategist called them \u201csofter Republicans,\u201d many of them employed by state government. Mr. Perry may be out of step with many of his new constituents.\n\nG. Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., said Democrats have the popular wind at their backs. In a poll of Pennsylvania voters he released on Thursday, 53 percent who are \u201cvery interested\u201d in the election said they would vote for a Democratic House candidate, against 30 percent who planned to vote Republican. And Mr. Trump\u2019s job approval rating in Pennsylvania is just 30 percent in the new poll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seven months out, but it looks like there\u2019ll be a Democratic wave,\u201d Mr. Madonna said.

Washington fears that Seoul might drift from their alliance and move closer to Beijing, while Mr. Trump feels his approach to North Korea is being undermined in the wake of a flurry of diplomatic initiatives by Mr. Kim in recent weeks, especially his meeting this week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, analysts said. (On Thursday, North Korea released an English-language version of a documentary of the trip.)\n\nWhen Mr. Kim began seeking talks this year after ratcheting up regional tensions with a string of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, United States officials argued that he had done so because of pressure from Mr. Trump, including the threat of sanctions.\n\nBut analysts say that Mr. Kim had already been planning to seek talks at the end of a hurried effort to complete what he called \u201ca state nuclear force\u201d last year.

At the same time, Mr. Kim\u2019s visit helped China reassert its role in diplomacy around denuclearizing North Korea, a process that has been dominated by South Korea and the United States in recent months. If China\u2019s role on the Korean Peninsula grows bigger, it strengthens North Korea\u2019s leverage in talks and helps China as well if a trade war with the United States comes to pass, said Professor Shim.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi has already complicated Mr. Trump\u2019s calculations.\n\nChina\u2019s state news media reported that Mr. Kim had called for \u201cphased, synchronized\u201d moves toward denuclearizing his country \u2014 the same approach the North insisted on in past negotiations with Washington. In those talks, the North said it would take only incremental steps toward giving up its nuclear program, beginning with a freeze, and demanded that the United States offer simultaneous incentives. Those past discussions all eventually collapsed as Washington and Pyongyang accused each other of reneging on agreements.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bolton, prefer.\n\nA key problem for Mr. Trump is that South Korea sides with China in arguing that the Libyan model is unrealistic, championing an \u201caction-for-action\u201d phased approach for denuclearization. When Mr. Xi\u2019s envoy, Yang Jiechi, visited Seoul this week, South Korea and China agreed to cooperate for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean crisis.

Mr. Trump\u2019s tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay.\n\nMr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nMr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hitler or Mussolini here,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, \u201cdisagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cEveryone who is married knows that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.\n\nAfter Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion \u201ccontribution to the U.S. economy\u201d over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States.\n\n\u201cYou know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants,\u201d the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to personally thank him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.\n\nMr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nMichael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, \u201cin places where we do see eye to eye, I think we\u2019re achieving extraordinary success.\u201d\n\nDean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201d\n\nThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.\n\nSome tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California\u2019s lawsuit on that issue.\n\nEven so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple\u2019s Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple\u2019s headquarters.\n\nSilicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan tax research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion \u201ccontribution\u201d to the American economy over five years.\n\nMost of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.\n\nThe president was quick to tweet the news.\n\nThe shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees.

Flynn resigned as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, the tabloid claimed that Mr. Obama had a secret plot to impeach Mr. Trump.

In January, he sought Saudi investors to help bankroll a possible acquisition of Time magazine, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. American Media disputed that.

He was considering expanding his media and events businesses into Saudi Arabia and also was hunting for moneyed partners in acquisitions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection of the tabloid publisher with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and Mr. Pecker, which was forged in the 1990s. At the time, Mr. Trump was celebrating a real estate comeback after his casino bankruptcies and was both the subject and the source of much gossip in New York.\n\nMr. Pecker, who had known Mr. Grine only for a few months, invited him to the dinner to thank him for advice he had provided about investing in the Middle East, according to someone who knew of the invitation.\n\nWord soon traveled back to Saudi Arabia about the dinner: It signaled Mr. Pecker\u2019s powerful status in Washington.\n\nTwo months later, he was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.\n\nAnd by January, Mr. Pecker was confident enough about his growing rapport with Saudi investors that he sought their help bankrolling a possible acquisition of Time magazine, which he had long coveted, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. A.M.I. disputed that.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe people briefed on the interactions between A.M.I. and Saudi Arabia requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Pecker\u2019s efforts to do business with the Saudis remains unclear. But he is still working to cultivate ties. This week, he and Mr. Grine both attended events in New York featuring Prince Mohammed, who is on a tour across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAhead of that visit, A.M.I. published a 97-page glossy magazine that is essentially a promotional brochure for Saudi Arabia and the crown prince. It makes no mention of anything troubling, like the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an influential client of Mr. Grine\u2019s.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 which refers to Saudi Arabia throughout as \u201cthe Magic Kingdom\u201d \u2014 includes an interview with Mr. Grine, accompanied by a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, taken during his visit with Mr. Pecker. It talks up the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, noting that Mr. Trump \u201cendorsed the crown prince\u2019s high profile anticorruption\u201d crackdown.\n\nA.M.I. has said it produced the magazine to \u201ccapitalize\u201d on interest in the crown prince, who is next in line to the throne, and has been careful to say it received no input or guidance from Saudi officials. That carries important legal implications: Foreign direction or control of such a purely promotional publication may require disclosure to the Justice Department. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 200,000 copies distributed in Walmart and other outlets, with a cover price of $13.99 and no advertising \u2014 provided a unique welcome mat for the prince, whose visit comes as the Trump administration is trying to establish tighter ties with the kingdom. Both countries are touting cross-border investment opportunities, including a pledge by the Saudi government to put $20 billion into a fund that will invest in American infrastructure projects. The kingdom is also nearing a deal to buy American-made missiles and other military equipment.\n\nMr. Grine, a 30-year-old French citizen, has helped broker deals between Saudi investors and companies in France, Senegal and the United States. He and Mr. Pecker were introduced last spring by Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the huge talent, entertainment and sports company based in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Grine and Mr. Pecker soon had a series of discussions about the investment landscape in Saudi Arabia, according to a person briefed on the talks. Mr. Pecker extended the White House dinner invitation shortly afterward.\n\nA.M.I. would not say who else was among the \u201cselect group of friends\u201d Mr. Pecker took to the White House at the president\u2019s invitation. During the evening, the Middle East and the recent French elections came up. In a statement, A.M.I. said, \u201cThe entire conversation was social, with the exception of a couple very brief mentions of current events.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pecker is best known for The Enquirer, but his media empire is wide-ranging.

Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, recently filed a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer was secretly involved when A.M.I. tried to bury her story about an affair with Mr. Trump. A.M.I. bought the rights to her story during the presidential campaign for $150,000 but never published it. In the world of gossip media, such a maneuver is known as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael D. Cohen and A.M.I. have denied the allegations. Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives say the affair never happened.\n\nDuring the campaign, The Enquirer also published scathing articles about Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, as well as perceived antagonists like the television host Megyn Kelly. In promoting Mr. Trump, The Enquirer endorsed a candidate for the first time in its history.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince he entered the White House, A.M.I. titles have run articles alleging a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine Mr. Trump.

He once endorsed Mr. Pecker to run Time magazine, whose cover, Mr. Trump has incorrectly asserted, has featured him more than anyone else.\n\n\u201cDavid Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine \u2014 nobody could bring it back like David!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a Tweet in 2013.\n\nAsked about Mr. Pecker\u2019s interest in Time, A.M.I.\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, said, \u201cAny media executive worth his or her salt must look at any acquisition opportunity in today\u2019s media climate.\u201d\n\nA.M.I. has struggled financially.

That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\u201d\n\nAs the Nielsen numbers for \u201cRoseanne\u201d rolled in, ABC executives went from gobsmacked \u2014 Mr. Sherwood said he thought the early figures he had seen were a mistake \u2014 to euphoric.\n\n\u201cPeople gather round and they see themselves in this family,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt speaks to a large number of people in the country who don\u2019t see themselves on television very often.\u201d\n\nBy Thursday, this dusted-off sitcom centered on a highly opinionated matriarch had become a flash point in the nation\u2019s culture wars. It had also spurred a cathartic response from many conservatives, who counted its opening-night success as their own.\n\nAmong those celebrating was President Trump, who called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the \u201chuge\u201d ratings. On Thursday, he gave a shout-out to the Emmy-winning star during a rally in Ohio.\n\n\u201cLook at Roseanne!

The onscreen Roseanne makes for a sharp foil to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s character, who wears a \u201cnasty woman\u201d T-shirt and accuses Trump supporters of \u201cwrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t advocate for Trump voters, but it respects them,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida. \u201cApparently, this is still news to people in the entertainment business, that there is an American working class.\u201d\n\nFor years, ABC focused on other demographic groups. With series like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d the network\u2019s lineup was notably diverse. But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.\n\nBy November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.\n\nThe meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201d\n\nIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nEven as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201d\n\nMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.\n\nAs a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\n\n\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201d", "keywords": ["victory", "roseanne", "heartland", "mr", "trumps", "trump", "abc", "sherwood", "success", "abcs", "president", "ratings", "network", "ms", "reboot", "sprang", "strategy"], "polarity": 0.0908357428632278, "subjectivity": 0.3910284427754307},

That continued a relatively muted celebration: The announcement of that agreement\u2019s details came not from Mr. Trump or his White House, but from South Korean officials; Trump administration officials unveiled the plan days later in a conference call with reporters.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump disparaged a previous version of a South Korea trade agreement as a \u201chorror show\u201d and a \u201cHillary Clinton special.\u201d He mused to the crowd that he might hold up finalizing the deal while he pursues planned talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, would you say?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seemed to veer off script in other areas as well.

We\u2019re going to have 100 percent of the caliphate, as they call it \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u2018land\u2019 \u2014 taking it all back quickly, quickly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe comment seemed in conflict with plans by his national security team to keep a small force in place. As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground\u201d and had \u201cdrawn off slightly\u201d to avoid accidental conflict with Russian troops, they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome foreign policy specialists said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria would leave a dangerous void. \u201cIf we\u2019re pulling those troops out, we\u2019re ceding the remnants of Syria to the Russians and the Iranians and the other actors, which actually I would argue would be a big victory for Russia,\u201d said Jamie M. Fly, a Republican scholar at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nMr. Trump eventually focused on infrastructure on Thursday, zeroing in on his plan to speed up permitting. But the subject and timing of the president\u2019s focus on his plan, announced in February, are curious. Congressional Republicans have not shown much appetite for taking up the infrastructure package, and neither have Democrats, who prefer proposals with much more federal spending.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged some of that reality in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get Democrat support very much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to wait until after the election.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have not mounted any sort of effort, in public or private, that matches the scale of the pressure campaign they employed before the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax cut package last year. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the infrastructure proposal, Gary D. Cohn, recently left his post as director of the National Economic Council. His successor, Larry Kudlow, is less enthusiastic about increases in federal infrastructure spending.\n\nThe administration envisions states, local governments and the private sector contributing the bulk of the funds, a recipe that experts doubt would result in anywhere close to the targeted level of investment.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill, said he was skeptical that the president\u2019s visit would spur any action.\n\n\u201cHe and Congress didn\u2019t blink whenever they shelled out a trillion and a half dollars in tax giveaways for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t seen a nickel yet for infrastructure. He can talk about it forever, but he\u2019s got to do something.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, echoed that sentiment on Thursday. \u201cDemocrats are eager to work with the administration on infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a lack of seriousness on this issue from the White House.\u201d", "keywords": ["south", "delay", "administration", "youre", "troops", "infrastructure", "heralds", "mr", "trump", "presidents", "officials", "deal", "plan", "korea", "trade", "syria"], "polarity": 0.0694902003762763, "subjectivity": 0.3339288910807898},

It cited the company\u2019s S.E.C. filing in concluding that Amazon took advantage of a variety of tax breaks and credits to avoid paying federal taxes.\n\nAmazon and the Postal Service\n\nMr. Trump has also previously criticized the relationship between Amazon and the Postal Service. In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.\n\nIt is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year. In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.\n\nThe beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.\n\nThose losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context.

Its mail business is still its \u201cmain source of revenue and contribution,\u201d the postmaster general, Megan J.

A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.\n\nIf that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.\n\nThe report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.\n\nThe report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.\n\nIn a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates.

They are mind-blowing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think to myself, You gave my guy grief because he wore a tan suit.\u201d\n\nMr. Holder said that if the same allegations of extramarital affairs had been made against Mr. Obama or President George W. Bush, their presidencies would have been over. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this has not had the reaction generated that would have been generated by any other president,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018American people need to know\u2019 the full story on C.I.A. interrogations.\n\nMr. Trump has nominated Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A., to be the next secretary of state and named a veteran of the spy agency, Gina Haspel, as the next director. Both nominations require Senate confirmation, and Ms. Haspel will certainly face questions about her work as a clandestine officer in the agency\u2019s counterterrorism operations. She oversaw a secret prison in Thailand involved in the rendition, detention and interrogation of detainees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Holder effectively closed that dark chapter in the C.I.A.\u2019s history, announcing that a three-year Justice Department investigation into brutal interrogations was ending without a prosecution. The decision outraged some liberals.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Holder said that Ms. Haspel would have to answer tough questions \u2014 and that the public deserved to know more about the country\u2019s enhanced interrogation program. He said that parts of the Justice Department report and a separate Senate investigation into the program should be declassified.\n\n\u201cThe American people need to know exactly what happened during that time period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018We have to do something\u2019 about gun violence.\n\nResponding to recent calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment, Mr. Holder said such an effort was impracticable but offered four suggestions to address what he called a \u201cgun violence epidemic in the United States.\u201d His remarks came days after John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, wrote an Op-Ed in The Times advocating repeal.\n\nAssault weapons should be banned, as well as higher-capacity magazines, Mr. Holder said. Background checks should be expanded for prospective gun buyers, and the government should reinstate the funding of studies on gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cCompare us to any other nation, and we are just off the charts when it comes to mass shootings and the number of people killed through the use of firearms,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cWe have to do something about it.\u201d", "keywords": ["block", "york", "citizenship", "gun", "justice", "haspel", "eric", "census", "hell", "mr", "violence", "president", "need", "question", "sue", "holder", "know"], "polarity": -0.026657251962130018, "subjectivity": 0.3431514623587794},

We have no actions at this time.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.\n\nHis comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.\n\nThe tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.\n\n\u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.\n\nDrew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nSeveral current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.\n\nBrad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d\n\nThe Post declined to comment.\n\nOne person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.\n\nThe president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThere was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nHow the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\n\n\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nBut the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.\n\nAT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.\n\nMr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.\n\nAmazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.\n\nThe size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.\n\nIn 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.\n\nBut when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "keywords": ["bezos", "saying", "does", "sales", "mr", "trump", "attacks", "pay", "amazon", "president", "company", "tax", "antitrust", "taxes"], "polarity": 0.03888908710337283, "subjectivity": 0.3692602269525346},

The claim was later shown to be false and based on flawed or selective intelligence.\n\nAmid the emotions that the war by then engendered, consideration of Mr. Bolton\u2019s nomination turned into a five-month standoff as Senate Democrats scrutinized what they saw as Mr. Bolton\u2019s efforts to subvert the government\u2019s own findings in pursuit of his and his allies\u2019 beliefs.\n\nThe release of thousands of pages of documents revealed Mr. Bolton, an ally of Vice President Dick Cheney, to be a volatile, aggressive infighter, who seemed willing to cherry-pick intelligence, steamroll analysts he did not agree with and end-run his State Department bosses in pursuit of an agenda considered bellicose even among Bush administration hawks. He shared that penchant with Mr. Cheney, who repeatedly confronted intelligence professionals and agencies whose analytical assessments did not support his conclusions in favor of the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cA lot of officials in Washington behave badly, so that, sadly enough, was unlikely to be disqualifying,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the committee\u2019s Democratic staff director. But in examining reasons for Mr. Bolton\u2019s behavior, \u201cThat\u2019s when threads started emerging, and when we pulled on them, we started to find things that were truly disturbing, including to Republican members of the committee.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut not all Republicans, according to Dan Diller, who was deputy staff director for the committee majority.\n\n\u201cThere was some validity\u201d to accusations of Mr. Bolton\u2019s behavior during the investigation, Mr. Diller wrote in an email, but it \u201cfound no clear ethical transgressions. He was an aggressive, sharp-elbowed bureaucratic operator who always tried to get his way, but would relent in the end rather than engaging in insubordination.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Bolton for the United Nations job in March 2005, Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, praised him as a \u201ctough-minded diplomat\u201d with a successful track record as an under secretary for arms control and an assistant secretary of state for international organizations.", "keywords": ["recalling", "changed", "iraq", "intelligence", "war", "kick", "mr", "say", "confirmation", "state", "process", "secretary", "senate", "president", "kiss", "bolton", "boltons"], "polarity": 0.012000000000000005, "subjectivity": 0.45399999999999996},

College-educated suburbanites outside Philadelphia are angry at Mr. Trump and in a mood to send him a message. And blue-collar voters in western Pennsylvania are suddenly up for grabs, after they turned out strongly in the special election this month to elect a moderate young Democrat, Conor Lamb, over a Republican who ran as a wingman to the president.\n\nIn the Philadelphia suburbs, three Republican incumbents who have seen the writing on the wall are retiring, and a fourth is stepping down after a sexual harassment scandal. The latest to retire is Representative Ryan Costello, who announced his decision over the weekend, citing the difficulty of being heard over the cacophony from the White House.\n\nThe shifts outside Philadelphia mirror changes in suburbs around the country, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and behavior have pushed away college-educated voters. The Pew Research Center reported this week that more voters with a four-year college degree now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic \u2014 54 percent \u2014 than at any time since 1994.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s suburbs were once so reliably Republican that Ronald Reagan\u2019s cabinet included three residents of Montgomery County alone. But the region\u2019s allegiance began to shift as well-educated and culturally liberal voters came to predominate in the suburbs in the 1990s.\n\nThe tide was held back in the last decade by gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Republicans to protect their candidates. But that map was thrown out by the state court in January, and Republicans lost appeals to have the United States Supreme Court intervene. The state's new districts hew more compactly to county and town boundaries.\n\nTwo nonpartisan handicappers of House races, the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, now rate four Republican-held seats in the Philadelphia suburbs as either \u201csolidly\u201d Democratic, \u201clikely\u201d to fall into the party\u2019s hands, or \u201cleaning\u201d that way.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a record of attracting crossover votes from Democrats and enjoys the advantages of incumbency but is in his first term. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get incumbents, you typically knock them off in their first term,\u201d Mr. Gerow said.\n\nAt the other end of the state, Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, is running his second race of the year, this time in a new district against an incumbent, Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican who was once paired by a political blog in a celebrity look-alike feature with the cartoon character Milhouse.\n\nThe new district, the 17th, is more evenly balanced in its partisan leanings than the former 18th District, where Mr. Lamb won his upset victory in part by reawakening dormant Democratic DNA in white working-class voters who had supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rothfus, by contrast, is \u201cseveral clicks to the right\u201d of his new district, according to one Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess the race.\n\nAnother Republican who was shifted to a more competitive district is Representative Scott Perry, who represents Harrisburg and York in central Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry is the only member of the far-right Freedom Caucus in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Mr. Trump won his old district by 21 percentage points; the new map places him in territory the president carried by only nine.\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Perry.

Washington fears that Seoul might drift from their alliance and move closer to Beijing, while Mr. Trump feels his approach to North Korea is being undermined in the wake of a flurry of diplomatic initiatives by Mr. Kim in recent weeks, especially his meeting this week with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, analysts said.

At the same time, Mr. Kim\u2019s visit helped China reassert its role in diplomacy around denuclearizing North Korea, a process that has been dominated by South Korea and the United States in recent months. If China\u2019s role on the Korean Peninsula grows bigger, it strengthens North Korea\u2019s leverage in talks and helps China as well if a trade war with the United States comes to pass, said Professor Shim.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s meeting with Mr. Xi has already complicated Mr. Trump\u2019s calculations.\n\nChina\u2019s state news media reported that Mr. Kim had called for \u201cphased, synchronized\u201d moves toward denuclearizing his country \u2014 the same approach the North insisted on in past negotiations with Washington. In those talks, the North said it would take only incremental steps toward giving up its nuclear program, beginning with a freeze, and demanded that the United States offer simultaneous incentives.

And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay.\n\nMr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nMr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Hitler or Mussolini here,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, \u201cdisagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cEveryone who is married knows that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.\n\nAfter Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion \u201ccontribution to the U.S. economy\u201d over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States.\n\n\u201cYou know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants,\u201d the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to personally thank him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.\n\nMr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nMichael Kratsios, the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, \u201cin places where we do see eye to eye, I think we\u2019re achieving extraordinary success.\u201d\n\nDean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201d\n\nThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.\n\nSome tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California\u2019s lawsuit on that issue.\n\nEven so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple\u2019s Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple\u2019s headquarters.\n\nSilicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan tax research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion \u201ccontribution\u201d to the American economy over five years.\n\nMost of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.\n\nThe president was quick to tweet the news.\n\nThe shifting relationship between Silicon Valley and Mr. Trump appears to have upset some tech employees. A Facebook page called \u201cAngry Googler,\u201d with nearly 1,000 followers, has been dedicated to criticizing Google for any sign it was cooperating with the president.\n\n\u201cNot happy about Google pulling a 180 and jumping into bed with Trump? Same here,\u201d said the \u201cAbout\u201d section of the page, which suggests it is run by a Google employee. This month, the page posted an article about Google helping the Defense Department analyze drone footage. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from organizing the world\u2019s information to \u2026 optimizing weapons of war,\u201d the page said.\n\nMessages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.\n\nSome tech firms remain discomfited about appearing as the president\u2019s allies. Last month, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, played down Russia\u2019s impact on the 2016 election after the Justice Department charged 13 Russians with trying to subvert its outcome, including by using Facebook. Mr. Trump retweeted Mr. Goldman approvingly.\n\nFacebook was uncomfortable with that association with the president, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d", "keywords": ["facebook", "silicon", "tech", "billion", "warms", "mr", "trump", "president", "tax", "google", "start", "apple", "chilly", "valley", "month"], "polarity": 0.12174335871625029, "subjectivity": 0.3749671847563413},

Flynn resigned as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, the tabloid claimed that Mr. Obama had a secret plot to impeach Mr. Trump. And as recently as March 2017 the tabloid continued to claim that Mr. Obama, who was born in Hawaii, was foreign born, even though Mr. Trump had since let go of the false birther theory that he long promoted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the love, and defense, of Trump\n\nThe National Enquirer and its parent company have not only helped the president by denigrating others, but also repeatedly praised Mr. Trump, his decisions and his character.\n\nIn March 2016, for the first time in its 90 years, The Enquirer endorsed a candidate for president \u2014 Donald J. Trump.\n\nWhile Ms. McDougal and a pornographic-film star, Stephanie Clifford, who is known professionally as Stormy Daniels, have come forward and said they have had affairs with the president, The Enquirer recently ran a favorable cover that blared: \u201cDonald & Melania Fight Back!

Through an Oval Office visit and at dinner with Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker showcased his access to the president \u2014 and word got back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSeveral months later, Mr. Pecker traveled to Saudi Arabia. In January, he sought Saudi investors to help bankroll a possible acquisition of Time magazine, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. American Media disputed that. As Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, arrived this month for a tour of the United States, Mr. Pecker\u2019s company published a 97-page magazine about Saudi Arabia that glosses over troubling details about the kingdom.\n\nThere is no mention of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals.", "keywords": ["saudi", "special", "article", "mr", "championed", "pecker", "trump", "obama", "2016", "times", "president", "defended", "david", "enquirer", "white"], "polarity": 0.026256736460818088, "subjectivity": 0.32224578142945487},

He was considering expanding his media and events businesses into Saudi Arabia and also was hunting for moneyed partners in acquisitions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection of the tabloid publisher with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and Mr. Pecker, which was forged in the 1990s. At the time, Mr. Trump was celebrating a real estate comeback after his casino bankruptcies and was both the subject and the source of much gossip in New York.\n\nMr. Pecker, who had known Mr. Grine only for a few months, invited him to the dinner to thank him for advice he had provided about investing in the Middle East, according to someone who knew of the invitation.\n\nWord soon traveled back to Saudi Arabia about the dinner: It signaled Mr. Pecker\u2019s powerful status in Washington.\n\nTwo months later, he was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.\n\nAnd by January, Mr. Pecker was confident enough about his growing rapport with Saudi investors that he sought their help bankrolling a possible acquisition of Time magazine, which he had long coveted, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. A.M.I. disputed that.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe people briefed on the interactions between A.M.I. and Saudi Arabia requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Pecker\u2019s efforts to do business with the Saudis remains unclear. But he is still working to cultivate ties. This week, he and Mr. Grine both attended events in New York featuring Prince Mohammed, who is on a tour across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAhead of that visit, A.M.I. published a 97-page glossy magazine that is essentially a promotional brochure for Saudi Arabia and the crown prince. It makes no mention of anything troubling, like the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an influential client of Mr. Grine\u2019s.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 which refers to Saudi Arabia throughout as \u201cthe Magic Kingdom\u201d \u2014 includes an interview with Mr. Grine, accompanied by a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, taken during his visit with Mr. Pecker. It talks up the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, noting that Mr. Trump \u201cendorsed the crown prince\u2019s high profile anticorruption\u201d crackdown.\n\nA.M.I. has said it produced the magazine to \u201ccapitalize\u201d on interest in the crown prince, who is next in line to the throne, and has been careful to say it received no input or guidance from Saudi officials. That carries important legal implications: Foreign direction or control of such a purely promotional publication may require disclosure to the Justice Department. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 200,000 copies distributed in Walmart and other outlets, with a cover price of $13.99 and no advertising \u2014 provided a unique welcome mat for the prince, whose visit comes as the Trump administration is trying to establish tighter ties with the kingdom. Both countries are touting cross-border investment opportunities, including a pledge by the Saudi government to put $20 billion into a fund that will invest in American infrastructure projects. The kingdom is also nearing a deal to buy American-made missiles and other military equipment.\n\nMr. Grine, a 30-year-old French citizen, has helped broker deals between Saudi investors and companies in France, Senegal and the United States. He and Mr. Pecker were introduced last spring by Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the huge talent, entertainment and sports company based in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Grine and Mr. Pecker soon had a series of discussions about the investment landscape in Saudi Arabia, according to a person briefed on the talks. Mr. Pecker extended the White House dinner invitation shortly afterward.\n\nA.M.I. would not say who else was among the \u201cselect group of friends\u201d Mr. Pecker took to the White House at the president\u2019s invitation. During the evening, the Middle East and the recent French elections came up. In a statement, A.M.I. said, \u201cThe entire conversation was social, with the exception of a couple very brief mentions of current events.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pecker is best known for The Enquirer, but his media empire is wide-ranging.

Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, recently filed a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer was secretly involved when A.M.I. tried to bury her story about an affair with Mr. Trump. A.M.I. bought the rights to her story during the presidential campaign for $150,000 but never published it. In the world of gossip media, such a maneuver is known as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael D. Cohen and A.M.I. have denied the allegations. Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives say the affair never happened.\n\nDuring the campaign, The Enquirer also published scathing articles about Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, as well as perceived antagonists like the television host Megyn Kelly. In promoting Mr. Trump, The Enquirer endorsed a candidate for the first time in its history.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince he entered the White House, A.M.I. titles have run articles alleging a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine Mr. Trump.

He once endorsed Mr. Pecker to run Time magazine, whose cover, Mr. Trump has incorrectly asserted, has featured him more than anyone else.\n\n\u201cDavid Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine \u2014 nobody could bring it back like David!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a Tweet in 2013.\n\nAsked about Mr. Pecker\u2019s interest in Time, A.M.I.\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, said, \u201cAny media executive worth his or her salt must look at any acquisition opportunity in today\u2019s media climate.\u201d\n\nA.M.I. has struggled financially.

That\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been really looking at with eyes open since that time.\u201d\n\nAs the Nielsen numbers for \u201cRoseanne\u201d rolled in, ABC executives went from gobsmacked \u2014 Mr. Sherwood said he thought the early figures he had seen were a mistake \u2014 to euphoric.\n\n\u201cPeople gather round and they see themselves in this family,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt speaks to a large number of people in the country who don\u2019t see themselves on television very often.\u201d\n\nBy Thursday, this dusted-off sitcom centered on a highly opinionated matriarch had become a flash point in the nation\u2019s culture wars. It had also spurred a cathartic response from many conservatives, who counted its opening-night success as their own.\n\nAmong those celebrating was President Trump, who called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the \u201chuge\u201d ratings. On Thursday, he gave a shout-out to the Emmy-winning star during a rally in Ohio.\n\n\u201cLook at Roseanne!

The onscreen Roseanne makes for a sharp foil to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s character, who wears a \u201cnasty woman\u201d T-shirt and accuses Trump supporters of \u201cwrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t advocate for Trump voters, but it respects them,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist based in Florida. \u201cApparently, this is still news to people in the entertainment business, that there is an American working class.\u201d\n\nFor years, ABC focused on other demographic groups. With series like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d the network\u2019s lineup was notably diverse. But it was also geared toward upper-middle-class viewers, Ms. Dungey said.\n\nBy November 2016, ABC was coming off a TV season when it had finished in last place among the four major broadcast networks, with little hope of escaping the ratings basement in the near future. Like other networks, it was also losing viewers to Netflix and other streaming platforms.\n\nThe meeting that took place on the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise victory led the network to reconsider its strategy. Mr. Sherwood summed up what was going through his mind that day: \u201cGiven the declines of broadcast television, the year-after-year declines, are we programming in a way that is turning people off?\u201d\n\nIn response, ABC decided to back the singing competition show \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d less than two years after it had been canceled on Fox, its original network home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe went after it because that\u2019s a show that, fundamentally, is about the American dream,\u201d Mr. Sherwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a girl with a cowboy hat and a boy with a banjo and people from small towns where music has saved their lives in different ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne,\u201d which had its first run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, was another prime candidate for a reboot. It was a top-rated comedy that had won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes \u2014 not to mention that the woman who played its title character had become a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nEven as the president portrayed the success of \u201cRoseanne\u201d as a win of his own, however, ABC executives and \u201cRoseanne\u201d producers rejected the notion that the show\u2019s popularity was mainly because of its appeal to Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI would compare this to \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d said Tom Werner, an executive producer of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and other hit sitcoms like \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and \u201c3rd Rock From the Sun.\u201d \u201cA number of people watching \u2018All in the Family\u2019 said, \u2018Archie\u2019s a conservative and therefore it\u2019s a show about a conservative.\u2019 Well, it was made by Norman Lear.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason the show is successful is because it taps into the frustration and disappointment that working-class people feel about the economy right now,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you watch all the episodes, we don\u2019t really mention politics as much as we did in the pilot.\u201d\n\nMr. Werner pointed out that \u201cRoseanne\u201d will deal with the opioid epidemic and immigration in its seven remaining episodes, adding that the president does not come up much as the show goes on.\n\nAs a topical, working-class sitcom led by a Trump supporter, \u201cRoseanne\u201d is unique \u2014 for now. Its early ratings success is likely to spur copycats in Hollywood, which is not known for its high percentage of conservatives.\n\n\u201cMoney is the ideology of Hollywood,\u201d said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center for media and society at the University of Southern California. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an executive who would turn down something for ideological reasons that they think has a chance to do a good number.\u201d", "keywords": ["victory", "roseanne", "heartland", "mr", "trumps", "trump", "abc", "sherwood", "success", "abcs", "president", "ratings", "network", "ms", "reboot", "sprang", "strategy"], "polarity": 0.0908357428632278, "subjectivity": 0.3910284427754307},

Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration\u2019s efforts to roll back what he called \u201cjob killing\u201d regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.\n\n\u201cReally, I have gotten done much more than I promised,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe did a lot of things I didn\u2019t even promise.\u201d\n\nIn the driving rain, Mr. Trump made his way to the training center, where he had been scheduled to sell an ambitious plan that would try to leverage $200 billion in federal spending to generate $1.5 trillion in total spending on projects such as tunnels, bridges and highways. White House officials had framed the event as a ramp-up, but this conflicted with the president\u2019s decision to say he would push the plan to next year, declaring that he did not expect it to pass at least until after the November midterm elections.\n\nAlso curiously, Mr. Trump spent little time on the trade deal struck with South Korea this week, which had been a win for his administration. That continued a relatively muted celebration: The announcement of that agreement\u2019s details came not from Mr. Trump or his White House, but from South Korean officials; Trump administration officials unveiled the plan days later in a conference call with reporters.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump disparaged a previous version of a South Korea trade agreement as a \u201chorror show\u201d and a \u201cHillary Clinton special.\u201d He mused to the crowd that he might hold up finalizing the deal while he pursues planned talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, would you say?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seemed to veer off script in other areas as well. At one point, he suggested that he planned to pull American troops out of Syria, where they have aided a military campaign that has recaptured the vast majority of the territory once controlled by the Islamic State, or ISIS. \u201cWe\u2019re knocking the hell out of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon.

We\u2019re going to have 100 percent of the caliphate, as they call it \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u2018land\u2019 \u2014 taking it all back quickly, quickly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe comment seemed in conflict with plans by his national security team to keep a small force in place. As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground\u201d and had \u201cdrawn off slightly\u201d to avoid accidental conflict with Russian troops, they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome foreign policy specialists said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria would leave a dangerous void. \u201cIf we\u2019re pulling those troops out, we\u2019re ceding the remnants of Syria to the Russians and the Iranians and the other actors, which actually I would argue would be a big victory for Russia,\u201d said Jamie M. Fly, a Republican scholar at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nMr. Trump eventually focused on infrastructure on Thursday, zeroing in on his plan to speed up permitting. But the subject and timing of the president\u2019s focus on his plan, announced in February, are curious. Congressional Republicans have not shown much appetite for taking up the infrastructure package, and neither have Democrats, who prefer proposals with much more federal spending.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged some of that reality in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get Democrat support very much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to wait until after the election.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have not mounted any sort of effort, in public or private, that matches the scale of the pressure campaign they employed before the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax cut package last year. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the infrastructure proposal, Gary D. Cohn, recently left his post as director of the National Economic Council. His successor, Larry Kudlow, is less enthusiastic about increases in federal infrastructure spending.\n\nThe administration envisions states, local governments and the private sector contributing the bulk of the funds, a recipe that experts doubt would result in anywhere close to the targeted level of investment.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill, said he was skeptical that the president\u2019s visit would spur any action.\n\n\u201cHe and Congress didn\u2019t blink whenever they shelled out a trillion and a half dollars in tax giveaways for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t seen a nickel yet for infrastructure. He can talk about it forever, but he\u2019s got to do something.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, echoed that sentiment on Thursday. \u201cDemocrats are eager to work with the administration on infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a lack of seriousness on this issue from the White House.\u201d", "keywords": ["south", "delay", "administration", "youre", "troops", "infrastructure", "heralds", "mr", "trump", "presidents", "officials", "deal", "plan", "korea", "trade", "syria"], "polarity": 0.0694902003762763, "subjectivity": 0.3339288910807898},

In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.\n\nIt is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year.

In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.\n\nThose losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context.

A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.\n\nIf that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.\n\nThe report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.\n\nThe report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.\n\nIn a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates.

Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d\n\nThe Post declined to comment.\n\nOne person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.\n\nThe president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThere was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nHow the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\n\n\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nBut the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.\n\nAT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.\n\nMr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.\n\nAmazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.\n\nThe size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.\n\nIn 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.\n\nBut when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "keywords": ["bezos", "saying", "does", "sales", "mr", "trump", "attacks", "pay", "amazon", "president", "company", "tax", "antitrust", "taxes"], "polarity": 0.03888908710337283, "subjectivity": 0.3692602269525346},

Bolton, President Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, was portrayed during a 2005 Senate confirmation hearing as a threat to U.S. interests. Audio\n\nThe confirmation battle took place during the first years of the Iraq war, a conflict Mr. Bolton supported and defends to this day. In the run-up to the war, he was a key proponent of the administration\u2019s argument for the invasion: that the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in 2002. The claim was later shown to be false and based on flawed or selective intelligence.\n\nAmid the emotions that the war by then engendered, consideration of Mr. Bolton\u2019s nomination turned into a five-month standoff as Senate Democrats scrutinized what they saw as Mr. Bolton\u2019s efforts to subvert the government\u2019s own findings in pursuit of his and his allies\u2019 beliefs.\n\nThe release of thousands of pages of documents revealed Mr. Bolton, an ally of Vice President Dick Cheney, to be a volatile, aggressive infighter, who seemed willing to cherry-pick intelligence, steamroll analysts he did not agree with and end-run his State Department bosses in pursuit of an agenda considered bellicose even among Bush administration hawks. He shared that penchant with Mr. Cheney, who repeatedly confronted intelligence professionals and agencies whose analytical assessments did not support his conclusions in favor of the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cA lot of officials in Washington behave badly, so that, sadly enough, was unlikely to be disqualifying,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the committee\u2019s Democratic staff director. But in examining reasons for Mr. Bolton\u2019s behavior, \u201cThat\u2019s when threads started emerging, and when we pulled on them, we started to find things that were truly disturbing, including to Republican members of the committee.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut not all Republicans, according to Dan Diller, who was deputy staff director for the committee majority.\n\n\u201cThere was some validity\u201d to accusations of Mr. Bolton\u2019s behavior during the investigation, Mr. Diller wrote in an email, but it \u201cfound no clear ethical transgressions. He was an aggressive, sharp-elbowed bureaucratic operator who always tried to get his way, but would relent in the end rather than engaging in insubordination.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Bolton for the United Nations job in March 2005, Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, praised him as a \u201ctough-minded diplomat\u201d with a successful track record as an under secretary for arms control and an assistant secretary of state for international organizations.", "keywords": ["recalling", "changed", "iraq", "intelligence", "war", "kick", "mr", "say", "confirmation", "state", "process", "secretary", "senate", "president", "kiss", "bolton", "boltons"], "polarity": 0.012000000000000005, "subjectivity": 0.45399999999999996},

Call me a crybaby snowflake, but this victory seemed rigged. Kindly donate to my GoFundMe campaign to finance a recount.\n\nThe winners were named team leaders for the maxi challenge, a \u201cpharma-Rusical\u201d (translation: a RuPaul-branded musical parody of modern pharmaceuticals and the ads that push them \u2014 it was a reach), and invited to choose their respective teams. The precarious phoenix Eureka was last standing, and landed by default on Team Asia, whose eponymous captain was displeased. \u201cShe talks a lot,\u201d Asia snipped.\n\nShe talked a lot. \u201cCan I suggest something?\u201d \u201cCan we just read through it out loud?\u201d \u201cCan we have a team name?\u201d Look, I\u2019m all for women raising their voices and seizing positions of power, but this is a maxi-challenge and time is short, and, however undemocratically elected, there is a team leader.

The self-proclaimed triple threat Blair St. Clair showed us that her dancing is certainly no threat, and her acting at best a passive-aggressive text.

In nine seasons of this show, we\u2019ve been brought to our knees over and over by the stunning, innovative creations of much lesser queens than those assembled on this runway. Are these queens more substance than style? Have we all now arrived at the anniversary after which we cheat and let ourselves go? Is this feminism?\n\nThe Vixen\u2019s was, again inexplicably, declared the winning team, and in a shocking and senseless upset, she was named the singular winner of the maxi-challenge. I have to hand it to her: When she\u2019s angry, she is keen and shrewd. And though her talent be but little, for some reason, RuPaul thinks she is fierce.\n\nEureka was scolded for her utter failure of a lip sync in the maxi challenge, and she wept as she confessed her fear and anxiety about her ability to make the most of her comeback opportunity. Mama Ru, in one of her Drag Oprah moments, said, \u201cEureka, I wish there was a pill to make you believe in yourself as much as we do,\u201d as she sentenced both she and Kalorie to lip sync for their lives to \u201cBest of My Love,\u201d by the underrated Emotions.\n\nWhatever pill Eureka took before pulling out her paroxysmic lip sync, she should do an actual ad for it \u2014 unless the vertigo that seems to keep knocking her off her feet is its side effect \u2014 because it reuptook her to safety.

The Pit Crew wheeled in a 99-cent store\u2019s worth of pool noodles, dish sponges and assorted capitalist effluvia, from which the queens cobbled together an impressive array of looks and hit the runway.\n\nBefore the judging, Ru announced that another queen would be returning. (No, it wasn\u2019t Shangela. She\u2019s walking in the woods.) The competitors visibly blanched as Ru introduced the Season 9 contestant Farrah Moan \u2026 who was quickly Ru-vealed to actually be Farrah\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger, the guest judge Christina Aguilera. Ms. Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why \u201cBurlesque\u201d was her last notable acting job, then pulled out a hand-held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run. The queens swooned.\n\nMayhem, who crafted a cigarette-girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags, leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge. The judge and national treasure Ross Mathews soothed and encouraged her by saying, \u201cThis is your time.\u201d I paid my therapist $200 an hour to tell me that when my husband left me, so, Mayhem, consider that money in your bank. Invest in Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe bottom two were Kalorie, correctly called on the carpet for her \u201cmillion dollar dress\u201d of generic Monopoly money hot-glued to an ill-fitting bustier (a fourth-removed cousin of superior cash-fronted gowns of queens past), and Vanessa, spatchcocked by Michelle Visage for her definition-deficient, doll-festooned silk-flower leotard. (\u201cIt\u2019s literally a head and legs, and the rest is flowers,\u201d Michelle hissed, somehow turning into an insult the exact phrase I\u2019ve always dreamed a man would use to describe my body.)

In a coup de gr\u00e2ce, she pulled a fistful of dollar bills from her bustier and made it rain on herself.\n\nVanessa\u2019s lip sync was a bit wan in comparison, and she was, sadly, the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave. She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away \u2014 I hope this isn\u2019t the last we see of her.\n\nRu declared at the top of the episode that the mission of \u201cDrag Race\u201d is to take over the world, and 10 years in, his coup seems to be just about complete. The show\u2019s stars have millions of fans and fill performance halls in red states, with teenage girls cosplaying as their favorite queens.

I\u2019ll admit: I love a flash mob proposal, I love an OK Go video, I love a high school theater troupe\u2019s mannequin challenge. I love live television and I love a feat. And this got me.\n\nIn the loading dock, Kennedy and the dancers charged out of the back of a U-Haul, kicking, spinning and flipping. \u201cMake the world remember your name,\u201d she sang.\n\nShangela stomped in Knowles-Carter formation with tool-belted female dancers \u2014 \u201cI worked my way, paid my dues, got the whole world screamin\u2019 \u2018Halleloo\u2019\u201d \u2014 and pushed the camera over to BeBe, purring among a bunch of sewing machines, which is rich because she can\u2019t sew: \u201cFace face face, body and all, another day, another slay, meow meow.\u201d (Can a university press release her book of poems, please?)\n\nTrixie beckoned the camera down a side hallway, teasing, \u201cI\u2019m the MVP headin\u2019 up to bat,\u201d pushing through costume racks and pieing one of the Pit Crew.\n\nOn the runway, the queens were asked to wear their best drag. BeBe prowled in a surprisingly low-key dress with leopard print swirls and a leopard headpiece, complete with bared teeth; Kennedy wore a rainbow-ruffled mermaid dress with a flaming-red wig; Trixie was wrapped flatteringly in black sheers, with a poodle wig; and Shangela looked incredible in a glittering charcoal-grey gown, jewels and Hollywood-blonde curls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGuess who\u2019s back in the house?\u201d RuPaul asked. Seated by the runway were the six eliminated queens \u2014 Morgan, Thorgy, Milk, Chi Chi, Aja and the sheepish deserter BenDeLaCreme, probably only there because she\u2019d been served papers in Seattle. With the exception of a blissed-out Chi Chi, they all looked pretty glum, like extended family whose flight home got canceled due to snow.\n\nThey would vote to determine the top two, RuPaul explained. (Really? You\u2019re not exactly dealing with the top brass there, Ru.)\n\nThe judges offered bits of final praise \u2014 to BeBe, for her mix of high fashion and camp; to Kennedy, for her formidable dancing; to Shangela, for her stage chops and polish; and to Trixie, for her growth.\n\n\u201cTrixie, I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d RuPaul said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Shangela,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Kennedy, and BeBe\u201d \u2014 sounding a bit like Selina Meyer on \u201cVeep\u201d having names whispered in her ear \u2014 \u201cand all of the girls.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Aja served Terry Gross Eleganza: \u201cWhat do you think you could contribute to the future of drag that we don\u2019t already get from Chad Michaels and Alaska?\u201d she asked BeBe; \u201cYou\u2019re a very good representation of where drag comes from, so I want to know how you can take that to the future?\u201d she asked Kennedy; \u201cYour brand is very stamped; how can you broaden that with this title?\u201d she asked Trixie.\n\nThorgy wanted to know who BeBe was going to eliminate in the episode prior. \u201cI asked the girls is it O.K. if I don\u2019t reveal, and everybody agreed that I should not,\u201d BeBe said, lying, and tape disproving this was immediately rolled.\n\n\u201cNone of the top four need this as much as I do,\u201d Kennedy told them, referencing BeBe\u2019s prior win and Trixie and Shangela\u2019s already-large careers.\n\n\u201cAfter Season 2 and 3, I went to drag school,\u201d Shangela said. \u201cI feel like tonight is my graduation. I earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Thorgy said \u2014 a nice bit of peacemaking.\n\nTrixie rattled off her post-Season 7 resume \u2014 a comedy tour; a hit album; a TV show \u2014 as proof she\u2019d utilize the crown. \u201cI felt like an All Star before I got here,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBack on the runway, \u201cMadam Forewoman\u201d Morgan stepped forward to deliver their tabulated vote. The top two: Kennedy \u2026 and Trixie. (I\u2019m sorry, what? Can, like, a drag Electoral College weigh in?)\n\n\u201cShangela and BeBe,\u201d RuPaul said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dears, but this is not your time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling,\u201d Shangela admitted in a confessional, in a moment of real emotion. \u201cBut the way Ru\u2019s looking at me is like, \u2018That\u2019s my child up there.\u2019 I\u2019m\u2019a keep my head up. My story\u2019s not over.\u201d\n\nKennedy and Trixie squared off in the final lip-sync, to Miley Cyrus\u2019s \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d an angsty choice for a finale. Trixie, in Dolly Parton hair, fell to her knees while Kennedy went full Jacob\u2019s Pillow, twirling barefoot.\n\nThe winner? Trixie.\n\n\u201cI remember being the weird new queen in Milwaukee nobody even wanted to give a gig to,\u201d she said triumphantly in a confessional.\n\nI harbor no ill will toward Trixie, whose show I watch and EPs I own. But it\u2019s hard to feel satisfied by a competition that made itself supplemental to an already-hot career. It\u2019s also hard to accept a top two that didn\u2019t include Shangela, who showed up prepared, who played the game full-out every episode, winning challenges with charm and a panoply of looks. I would\u2019ve loved her in a final lip-sync with BenDeLaCreme, who most surely would\u2019ve been there, and whose departure we can passive-aggressively assign some blame to.\n\nWhat Shangela feared had come to pass: her fellow queens had gone \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on her; this was the third treason. (In bonus footage of their vote released by World of Wonder, only Thorgy chose Shangela. BenDeLaCreme, who prioritized track records and challenge wins all season long, abandoned that rubric.)\n\nFor RuPaul to cede determining the final pair to an unruly gang feels odd and lawless. If ultimately, \u201cAll Stars\u201d is a competition that comes down to how 10 people feel about each other at any given moment, it might be time to revamp the rules.\n\nThat being said, there were highlights \u2014 I loved Kennedy and BenDeLaCreme in \u201cThe Bitchelor\u201d; I loved Aja\u2019s death-drops and BeBe\u2019s Diana Ross; I loved Milk\u2019s tentative first steps into introspection (it\u2019s always hardest for the hottest), and Chi Chi\u2019s knowing how long to stay at the fair.\n\nAnd I loved watching it with all of you.

Scene partners often overshadowed her in her season, but not here; she harnessed a, dare I say it, Katya-esque brio and nailed it. Kennedy, as struggling musical theater actress La La, high-kicked and sang aimlessly, and BeBe, as the Queen, was beguilingly odd, per usual. \u201cI wonder why I\u2019m being given the Queen,\u201d BeBe asked earnestly in a confessional, while wrapped in 40 fabrics.\n\n\u201cBeBe\u2019s character is just BeBe doing BeBe,\u201d Shangela complained in a confessional.

Trixie, who\u2019s not social and hates hugs, said she wants to be less standoffish; Kennedy, who\u2019d copped to coming off as a grump in Season 7, lamented not being a fan favorite; and BeBe was shocked \u2014 and delighted \u2014 to hear that people thought she was elitist. \u201cBut I am very goofy,\u201d she protested.

All three ranked in the bottom.\n\nThe top two: Shangela, in red spikes that \u2014 my goodness \u2014 inflated as she walked, and Trixie, witty-sexy in red hot pants with a stack of books and an apple on her head.\n\n\u201cYou are making yourself do things that wouldn\u2019t be in your comfort zone,\u201d Michelle Visage told Trixie. \u201cYou taking these risks is paying off.\u201d (I don\u2019t know that an acting challenge is necessarily out of her comfort zone, but sure \u2014 and she did wear a brown wig!)\n\nBackstage, Trixie compared BeBe\u2019s decorated face to Ornacia, Season 6 contestant Vivacious\u2019 infamous headpiece. BeBe looked at her blankly and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Ornacia?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fully never seen \u2018Drag Race,\u2019\u201d Trixie deadpanned to the camera as the group hooted. \u201cBeBe won \u2018Drag Race\u2019 and stopped watching it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl, get ready,\u201d Kennedy said, adding that the fans would \u201cme-me\u201d this moment to death.\n\n\u201cWhat is me-me?\u201d Shangela asked, correcting: \u201cMeme.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that,\u201d Kennedy replied.\n\nI miss Milk.\n\nThe bottom three made their cases for staying \u2014 BeBe\u2019s track record, Kennedy\u2019s drive, and Morgan\u2019s too-brief stint. \u201cThis is her second chance,\u201d Shangela said in a confessional, of Morgan. \u201cAnd look, I know about second chances.\u201d (God, she\u2019s good at this.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShangela and Trixie lip-synced to RuPaul\u2019s \u201cFreaky Money,\u201d and even an assured Trixie, fun in a neon-green wig and pink bodysuit, was no match for Shangela, who showed up to win. And win she did \u2014 ripping off a housedress to reveal a bulging, bikinied fat suit, Shangela went full clown, grinding and death-dropping as the judges shrieked with laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not over \u2019til the fat lady twerks,\u201d RuPaul said.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s not something I want to do, but it\u2019s part of what the gig is,\u201d Shangela said, and eliminated Morgan, who took it in stride.\n\n\u201cLove you guys,\u201d she said as she left.\n\nIt felt anti-climactic for the penultimate episode \u2014 a zero sum, or a deficit, if you missed BenDeLaCreme\u2019s ingenuity, which I did.

The cameras, like sharks smelling blood, circled.\n\nAs they powdered their faces for the runway, the group continued to discuss elimination ethics. \u201cSomething I really wanted to do was write who placed where every week, and try to do some math,\u201d BenDeLaCreme said, planning to AutoSum her way in Excel to the crown.\n\nAja weighed in, \u201cIf we\u2019re basing it on track record \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich we should not,\u201d Kennedy said, cutting her off. \u201cIf you end up in the top, you know what you gotta do. You\u2019ve been in this profession long enough to make your own decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still am interested in finding different perspectives,\u201d BenDeLaCreme replied.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Kennedy snapped, as battle drums pounded and Aja gasped.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Kennedy felt the need to escalate this, and the whole argument reminded me of a mind-numbing night learning The Settlers of Catan with friends. For the briefest of moments, I missed Milk. If we\u2019re just going to be debating the bylaws every week from here on out, bring back a mouthy delusional!\n\nOn the runway, the can drive kicked off with Aja in a \u201cSugar Tits\u201d candy soup can; Shangela with caffeinated \u201cHalleloops\u201d; Trixie\u2019s \u201cPep/Abysmal,\u201d which \u201cmay cause death\u201d; Kennedy\u2019s \u201cGrandma Kennedy\u2019s Pot Licka\u2019 Juice\u201d; BeBe\u2019s \u201cZaZa\u201d African peanut soup; and BenDeLaCreme\u2019s all-purpose \u201cCream de la Cr\u00e8me,\u201d \u201cwinner of literally everything.\u201d\n\nFor the couture challenge, each queen hopped off a (fake) white horse. Kennedy was safe, redeeming her off-brand grandma soup with incredible runway makeup. \u201cYou\u2019d definitely be catching everybody\u2019s attention at Studio 54,\u201d said the 30-year-old guest judge Shay Mitchell, an actress. BenDeLaCreme, in a fur wrap, was also safe.\n\nAt the top: Trixie, a pink, flare-panted vision \u2014 \u201cYou showed up today,\u201d Ross Matthews said; they love this narrative \u2014 and BeBe, whose sequined fringe dress the judges loved.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I see that for you, and I see that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the tables were turned, I wouldn\u2019t expect Shangela to save me just because I saved her once,\u201d Trixie said in a confessional. (Um, that\u2019s exactly what Shangela is expecting you\u2019ll do. Cut to Shangela\u2019s confessional ... )\n\n\u201cWhen Daenerys is creating alliances on \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 she\u2019s creating them out of mutual respect,\u201d said Shangela, who must be getting paid per reference. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I think I\u2019ve done in this competition.\u201d (Not for nothing, but Daenerys was also warned about \u201cthree treasons\u201d at the House of the Undying. Trixie\u2019s no ally; circle the dragons.)\n\nAcross the workroom, BeBe talked over Aja, saying everything but \u201cthanks for the dress.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve made it, girl, you\u2019re here,\u201d BeBe said in a condescending barrage. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you. I really love you. Let\u2019s go back to the group.\u201d\n\nTrixie and BeBe squared off in a lip-sync to Diana Ross\u2019s unimpeachable \u201cThe Boss.\u201d So many queens go big with a big song, but BeBe didn\u2019t. Like Latrice Royale or the late, great Sweetie, she stood still and sent out each lyric with joyous, knowing eyes. Trixie, whose makeup doesn\u2019t allow for much range, danced wildly around her, but BeBe won.\n\nIn a breathless coo, BeBe eliminated Aja. (The right decision, I suppose \u2014 even though you practiced the bake at home, sometimes it\u2019s hotter in the tent, as they say \u2014 but BeBe did Aja dirty this week.)\n\nBackstage, Aja shrugged it off; she\u2019s a star and she\u2019ll be fine. Before the credits rolled, we cut back to the dark main stage, where RuPaul sat alone. \u201cHow many of my eliminated queens were you able to capture?\u201d she asked Chad Michaels and Alaska, back in handmaid robes.\n\n\u201cWe think you\u2019ll be pleased,\u201d they replied, and three additional handmaids, with heads bowed, joined them.\n\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d RuPaul cackled.\n\nWill one of the ousted queens fight her way back? And at whose expense? Will BenDeLaCreme get that spreadsheet working? Will Shangela make better use of her HBO and branch out to other shows \u2014 \u201cVeep,\u201d maybe? \u201cThe Deuce\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil next week.", "keywords": ["stars", "soup", "drag", "race", "episode", "aja", "bendelacreme", "rupaul", "bebe", "trixie", "queens", "soups", "rupauls", "main", "week", "shangela", "season"], "polarity": 0.20597466259230965, "subjectivity": 0.4741405653170359},

The stakes are high and smarts prevail.\n\nTrixie announced she\u2019d be impersonating RuPaul, to a workroom full of stares. \u201cEvery time I do RuPaul in front of people they think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna win the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound real confident, sis,\u201d Aja said, with a hint of friendly warning.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Trixie replied, missing it.\n\nThe real RuPaul entered the workroom, with the designer Marc Jacobs, to walk around and instill doubt.

Aja did fine as a salty Crystal LaBeija, from the 1968 pageant documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d as did BeBe Zahara Benet, as Grace Jones. Shangela wisely opted for Jenifer Lewis, a personal friend she channeled loud and clear. Chi Chi DeVayne, on the other hand, faltered as Maya Angelou, misspelling Ms. Angelou\u2019s name right out of the gate.\n\nThe guest judge Kristin Chenoweth played as well. \u201cI always thought that one of these queens would do me, and no one ever did, so I decided to come here and do me,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said, singing a high note, something I worry she does in restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSweetheart, none of these queens are gonna do ya,\u201d BenDeLaCreme, as Mr. Lynde, quipped.\n\nAnd Trixie started out with a decent RuPaul impression that probably does get laughs in small doses but couldn\u2019t be sustained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won an uncomfortable phone call to your ex and a half-eaten hot dog from the back of my car,\u201d she interjected after another queen\u2019s answer, and Michelle Visage looked on, frozen, like an aunt at the Olympics whose niece just fell on the ice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said. (\u201cYeah,\u201d the producers of Trixie\u2019s hit Viceland show added, at home.)\n\nBackstage, the top two took meetings. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to plug away at this,\u201d BenDeLaCreme told Chi Chi, sounding a bit like the teacher of that painting class I shouldn\u2019t have taken.\n\nMeanwhile, Aja \u2014 who has calmly consoled so many queens backstage this season \u2014 sat with a vulnerable Trixie. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of drag in the real world,\u201d Trixie said, and I felt for her. She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances. Is Trixie Jon Snow, or is she Cersei Lannister?\u201d (Actually, right now I\u2019d say Trixie\u2019s more Season 3 Edmure Tully, firing arrows at his father\u2019s funeral boat and missing, am I right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s not-timeless \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d both Shangela and BenDeLaCreme were crowned winners and, in a twist, each was given the chance to eliminate one of the bottom three queens. BenDeLaCreme eliminated Chi Chi, fine, and Shangela, who really did a supermarket sweep of this episode, milked the moment. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve chosen didn\u2019t leave with the crown, but they made a career,\u201d she said, teasing out what sounded like a Trixie elimination, only to reveal she\u2019d eliminated Chi Chi as well. (Warning shot: fired \u2014 and a sobbing Trixie clearly heard it.)\n\n\u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chi Chi said, waving. \u201cI\u2019m sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could,\u201d she added backstage, smiling. \u201c\u2018All Stars 3\u2019 was hard.\u201d\n\nFinally: a gracious exit. God, I love Chi Chi. Does she bake? If she can get to the U.K., and get a consistent layer of jam between two Victoria sponges, there\u2019s a show I\u2019d like to see her on.\n\nWill Shangela get played? Will Trixie finally triumph?

BeBe started out strong as the Virgin, a princess direct from Africa who kept kneeling at his feet but ran out of steam fast. Trixie, as the Fake Bitch, wrested a couple moments from Milk, who, as the Psycho Stalker, babbled and shrieked over her. (\u201cDon\u2019t talk over each other,\u201d Michelle Visage had cautioned beforehand.) Chi Chi and Shangela, as a polyamorous lesbian couple, were unspecific and out to sea.

Even funnier was Kennedy\u2019s raunchy Party Girl, who also had trouble getting out of the limo, and hid bottle service in her padding. \u201cWe gonna make a toast to love,\u201d she said as Mr. Bowyer-Chapman disrobed for a massage by the pool, and the camera swooped in for a thirsty \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d pan of his torso. Kennedy slathered him in lotion, went in for a sloppy kiss, and, before passing out drunk, added, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d (This tour de force should come as no surprise; her turn as Little Richard won her Season 7\u2019s Snatch Game.)\n\nThe runway challenge, Wigs on Wigs on Wigs, was inspired by the Season 5 runner-up Roxxxy Andrews\u2019s reveal of a second wig during a lip-sync. The queens scrambled to get ready, gluing down their eyebrows and predicting the bottom three. How fun, with everyone in earshot! Tell me when you\u2019re tired of this, but on the show with the amateur British bakers, if someone has extra time \u2014 say they\u2019ve gotten their bread dough in the proving drawer early, or their 3-D gingerbread story didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 they\u2019ll help other bakers, glaze things, get things from the fridge for them.\n\nOn the runway, BeBe, Shangela and Trixie were safe. In the bottom: Aja, whose three-wigged Kawaii look was the best of the night but didn\u2019t redeem her failed Needy Girl performance; mod-clad Milk, deservedly dragged for her one-note Psycho (if only they\u2019d seen the workroom footage); and Chi Chi, lovely on the runway but overshadowed in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chi Chi tearfully told the judges, admitting the other queens\u2019 skills made her question her worth.\n\n\u201cChi Chi, you\u2019re worth it,\u201d the guest judge and pop-up life coach Constance Zimmer said.\n\nThe top two? BenDeLaCreme, for the third week in a row, and Kennedy, who announced backstage that she would forgo one-on-one appeals and decide who to eliminate on her own terms. BenDeLaCreme still kept office hours, though. Aja stopped by, knowing full well she wasn\u2019t going home \u2014 three wigs. Chi Chi shuffled over resignedly, as did Milk, who whispered, \u201cThe judges actually want me to continue in this.\u201d (What a choice: Chi Chi, a box of puppies, and Milk, a parking ticket.)\n\nA steady, inhabited lip-sync to Lorde\u2019s \u201cGreen Light\u201d won Kennedy the episode, and she eliminated Milk, who proved you can go big and go home.\n\nWill Chi Chi conquer her self-doubt?

The queens were assigned divas to impersonate \u2014 Trixie Mattel got Dolly Parton; Aja, Amy Winehouse; Thorgy Thor, Stevie Nicks \u2014 pairings that felt surprisingly considerate of each queen\u2019s strengths.\n\nThorgy, who admitted Ms. Nicks was one of her biggest inspirations, nevertheless bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, because that\u2019s what I was in Season 8,\u201d she said, before launching into a conspiracy theory: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being set up to fail. Next to Diana Ross and Janet Jackson, she is not like, \u2018Werk!\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t feel fair.\u201d\n\nFirst off, Stevie Nicks said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d that she carried a gram of cocaine in her boot for years, like a Laurel Canyon Mary Poppins; that\u2019s drama.

The queens lip-synced to cloyingly impersonated covers of RuPaul\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 you know VH1 can afford 40 seconds of \u201cNasty,\u201d so this move felt particularly cynical \u2014 followed by a \u201cRudemption\u201d runway, where they spruced up disastrous looks from their previous stints on the show.\n\nIn the top were BenDeLaCreme, who rapped cheekily as Julie Andrews; BeBe Zahara Benet, who nailed Diana Ross; and Shangela, who hammed up Mariah Carey and strutted the runway in a giant, rolling bubble. In the bottom: Kennedy Davenport, who lip-synced messily; Thorgy, who, surprise, didn\u2019t quite commit; and, for reasons unclear to me, Chi Chi, who put across a great Patti LaBelle and wore a shapely runway outfit, after repeated criticism from the Season 8 judges for not wearing padding. (\u201cI just loved you in \u2018Eraser,\u2019\u201d Chi Chi gushed to guest judge Vanessa Williams. \u201c\u2018Eraser,\u2019 baby, \u2018Eraser.\u201d\u201d)\n\nDid Thorgy deserve a bottom spot as well? Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion. Backstage, she behaved ru-diculously, crying and cursing, while the others rubbernecked in bemused shock. \u201cI was in character the entire time and to not be commended for it, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Milk said. \u201cI hate this.\u201d (I mean, they know this is going to be on television, right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBenDeLaCreme and Shangela were named top two and faced off in a lip-sync to The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cJump (For My Love).\u201d BenDeLaCreme unzipped to a second look mid-song, but Shangela whipped out a jump rope and victory was hers, as was the task of eliminating either Kennedy or Thorgy, who\u2019d continued to grouse backstage and angle for alliances. No dice: Shangela axed her.\n\n\u201cGross,\u201d Thorgy said. \u201cHave a good time without me,\u201d she added in the workroom, packing up. \u201cBye, it\u2019s going to be boring TV.\u201d\n\nTruly, get out. Also, you know, I hate to be a broken record, but there\u2019s this show with amateur British bakers, and if their meringues curdle it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but theirs, for not watching them more closely. They acknowledge and internalize this in their confessionals, which are filmed in the nearby meadow.

The precarious phoenix Eureka was last standing, and landed by default on Team Asia, whose eponymous captain was displeased. \u201cShe talks a lot,\u201d Asia snipped.\n\nShe talked a lot. \u201cCan I suggest something?\u201d \u201cCan we just read through it out loud?\u201d \u201cCan we have a team name?\u201d Look, I\u2019m all for women raising their voices and seizing positions of power, but this is a maxi-challenge and time is short, and, however undemocratically elected, there is a team leader. Lean out, Eureka.\n\nOn the other side of the workroom, installed autocrat The Vixen set about demonstrating that it can happen here by assigning roles outright, without accepting any input from her team members. \u201cThat is so cute,\u201d she smugly sang in a confessional. \u201c\u201cY\u2019all really think I\u2019m gonna leave it to you?\u201d Reject expert intelligence and go with your gut, Vixen.

In nine seasons of this show, we\u2019ve been brought to our knees over and over by the stunning, innovative creations of much lesser queens than those assembled on this runway. Are these queens more substance than style? Have we all now arrived at the anniversary after which we cheat and let ourselves go? Is this feminism?\n\nThe Vixen\u2019s was, again inexplicably, declared the winning team, and in a shocking and senseless upset, she was named the singular winner of the maxi-challenge. I have to hand it to her: When she\u2019s angry, she is keen and shrewd. And though her talent be but little, for some reason, RuPaul thinks she is fierce.\n\nEureka was scolded for her utter failure of a lip sync in the maxi challenge, and she wept as she confessed her fear and anxiety about her ability to make the most of her comeback opportunity. Mama Ru, in one of her Drag Oprah moments, said, \u201cEureka, I wish there was a pill to make you believe in yourself as much as we do,\u201d as she sentenced both she and Kalorie to lip sync for their lives to \u201cBest of My Love,\u201d by the underrated Emotions.\n\nWhatever pill Eureka took before pulling out her paroxysmic lip sync, she should do an actual ad for it \u2014 unless the vertigo that seems to keep knocking her off her feet is its side effect \u2014 because it reuptook her to safety. Kalorie\u2019s lip sync was sweet, but comparatively empty, and she sashayed away to an unhappy ending.\n\nConflama may have financed Andy Cohen\u2019s West Village condo expansion, but it is not what we love about this show. What we love about this show is its flashes of defiant beauty, its bruises of deep courage and self-discovery, and Ross Mathews. We don\u2019t want to watch the kind of infighting among allies that infects our social media feeds, however telegenic the fighters. We don\u2019t want the next drag superstar to be an angry, vengeful villain. We want the next drag superstar to be someone who can give us the best of their love. And it is frightening to think that they may not be out there.\n\nBut take it from a real-life Tinderella: Sometimes, to find out if one of your matches is that person, you have to pretend that the past was a dream, accept the apologies of the five o\u2019clock shadows that have offended you, and give them your hands.\n\nSee you next week.", "keywords": ["challenge", "lip", "drag", "team", "conflama", "sync", "race", "love", "episode", "queens", "asia", "best", "vixen", "rupauls", "abuse", "season"], "polarity": 0.13368602437751376, "subjectivity": 0.4156467793435879},

The Pit Crew wheeled in a 99-cent store\u2019s worth of pool noodles, dish sponges and assorted capitalist effluvia, from which the queens cobbled together an impressive array of looks and hit the runway.\n\nBefore the judging, Ru announced that another queen would be returning. (No, it wasn\u2019t Shangela. She\u2019s walking in the woods.) The competitors visibly blanched as Ru introduced the Season 9 contestant Farrah Moan \u2026 who was quickly Ru-vealed to actually be Farrah\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger, the guest judge Christina Aguilera. Ms. Aguilera did a quick bit that reminded us why \u201cBurlesque\u201d was her last notable acting job, then pulled out a hand-held mic from seemingly nowhere and did a quick melismatic run. The queens swooned.\n\nMayhem, who crafted a cigarette-girl ensemble out of latex gloves and trash bags, leaked tears when she was named the winner of the challenge. The judge and national treasure Ross Mathews soothed and encouraged her by saying, \u201cThis is your time.\u201d I paid my therapist $200 an hour to tell me that when my husband left me, so, Mayhem, consider that money in your bank. Invest in Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe bottom two were Kalorie, correctly called on the carpet for her \u201cmillion dollar dress\u201d of generic Monopoly money hot-glued to an ill-fitting bustier (a fourth-removed cousin of superior cash-fronted gowns of queens past), and Vanessa, spatchcocked by Michelle Visage for her definition-deficient, doll-festooned silk-flower leotard. (\u201cIt\u2019s literally a head and legs, and the rest is flowers,\u201d Michelle hissed, somehow turning into an insult the exact phrase I\u2019ve always dreamed a man would use to describe my body.) They were ordered to lip sync for their lives to Ms. Aguilera\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t No Other Man.\u201d\n\nKalorie described herself as \u201cthe twerking queen,\u201d and she is not wrong. In a coup de gr\u00e2ce, she pulled a fistful of dollar bills from her bustier and made it rain on herself.\n\nVanessa\u2019s lip sync was a bit wan in comparison, and she was, sadly, the first bat to be plucked from the renovated cave. She bravely fought back tears as she sashayed away \u2014 I hope this isn\u2019t the last we see of her.\n\nRu declared at the top of the episode that the mission of \u201cDrag Race\u201d is to take over the world, and 10 years in, his coup seems to be just about complete. The show\u2019s stars have millions of fans and fill performance halls in red states, with teenage girls cosplaying as their favorite queens. RuPaul has built a juggernaut on the wigs of queens old enough not just to be this season\u2019s drag mothers, but their birth mothers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut with great power comes great Ru-sponsibility.

But this crop of girls seems especially fun and smart, with good wigs on their padded shoulders, and I trust that one of them will responsibly lead us to the midterms.

It\u2019s also hard to accept a top two that didn\u2019t include Shangela, who showed up prepared, who played the game full-out every episode, winning challenges with charm and a panoply of looks. I would\u2019ve loved her in a final lip-sync with BenDeLaCreme, who most surely would\u2019ve been there, and whose departure we can passive-aggressively assign some blame to.\n\nWhat Shangela feared had come to pass: her fellow queens had gone \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on her; this was the third treason. (In bonus footage of their vote released by World of Wonder, only Thorgy chose Shangela. BenDeLaCreme, who prioritized track records and challenge wins all season long, abandoned that rubric.)\n\nFor RuPaul to cede determining the final pair to an unruly gang feels odd and lawless. If ultimately, \u201cAll Stars\u201d is a competition that comes down to how 10 people feel about each other at any given moment, it might be time to revamp the rules.\n\nThat being said, there were highlights \u2014 I loved Kennedy and BenDeLaCreme in \u201cThe Bitchelor\u201d; I loved Aja\u2019s death-drops and BeBe\u2019s Diana Ross; I loved Milk\u2019s tentative first steps into introspection (it\u2019s always hardest for the hottest), and Chi Chi\u2019s knowing how long to stay at the fair.\n\nAnd I loved watching it with all of you.

Scene partners often overshadowed her in her season, but not here; she harnessed a, dare I say it, Katya-esque brio and nailed it. Kennedy, as struggling musical theater actress La La, high-kicked and sang aimlessly, and BeBe, as the Queen, was beguilingly odd, per usual. \u201cI wonder why I\u2019m being given the Queen,\u201d BeBe asked earnestly in a confessional, while wrapped in 40 fabrics.\n\n\u201cBeBe\u2019s character is just BeBe doing BeBe,\u201d Shangela complained in a confessional.

I see that for you, and I see that for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the tables were turned, I wouldn\u2019t expect Shangela to save me just because I saved her once,\u201d Trixie said in a confessional.

Like Latrice Royale or the late, great Sweetie, she stood still and sent out each lyric with joyous, knowing eyes. Trixie, whose makeup doesn\u2019t allow for much range, danced wildly around her, but BeBe won.\n\nIn a breathless coo, BeBe eliminated Aja. (The right decision, I suppose \u2014 even though you practiced the bake at home, sometimes it\u2019s hotter in the tent, as they say \u2014 but BeBe did Aja dirty this week.)\n\nBackstage, Aja shrugged it off; she\u2019s a star and she\u2019ll be fine.

The stakes are high and smarts prevail.\n\nTrixie announced she\u2019d be impersonating RuPaul, to a workroom full of stares. \u201cEvery time I do RuPaul in front of people they think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna win the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound real confident, sis,\u201d Aja said, with a hint of friendly warning.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Trixie replied, missing it.\n\nThe real RuPaul entered the workroom, with the designer Marc Jacobs, to walk around and instill doubt. (Jacobs, curiously, was not there for a fashion challenge \u2014 perhaps they were getting lunch and Ru was like, \u201cJust a sec, I have to tape this, come with.\u201d)\n\n\u201cYour accent sounded a little like Ireland,\u201d RuPaul told Shangela, who shelved her plans to be Miss Cleo then and there.\n\nDuring the challenge, BenDeLaCreme killed with an inspired, pitch-perfect Paul Lynde, while Kennedy flopped as Phaedra Parks, of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d (Both won Snatch Game in their respective seasons.) Aja did fine as a salty Crystal LaBeija, from the 1968 pageant documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d as did BeBe Zahara Benet, as Grace Jones. Shangela wisely opted for Jenifer Lewis, a personal friend she channeled loud and clear. Chi Chi DeVayne, on the other hand, faltered as Maya Angelou, misspelling Ms. Angelou\u2019s name right out of the gate.\n\nThe guest judge Kristin Chenoweth played as well. \u201cI always thought that one of these queens would do me, and no one ever did, so I decided to come here and do me,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said, singing a high note, something I worry she does in restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSweetheart, none of these queens are gonna do ya,\u201d BenDeLaCreme, as Mr. Lynde, quipped.\n\nAnd Trixie started out with a decent RuPaul impression that probably does get laughs in small doses but couldn\u2019t be sustained. \u201cYou\u2019ve won an uncomfortable phone call to your ex and a half-eaten hot dog from the back of my car,\u201d she interjected after another queen\u2019s answer, and Michelle Visage looked on, frozen, like an aunt at the Olympics whose niece just fell on the ice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said. (\u201cYeah,\u201d the producers of Trixie\u2019s hit Viceland show added, at home.)\n\nBackstage, the top two took meetings. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to plug away at this,\u201d BenDeLaCreme told Chi Chi, sounding a bit like the teacher of that painting class I shouldn\u2019t have taken.\n\nMeanwhile, Aja \u2014 who has calmly consoled so many queens backstage this season \u2014 sat with a vulnerable Trixie. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of drag in the real world,\u201d Trixie said, and I felt for her. She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances. Is Trixie Jon Snow, or is she Cersei Lannister?\u201d (Actually, right now I\u2019d say Trixie\u2019s more Season 3 Edmure Tully, firing arrows at his father\u2019s funeral boat and missing, am I right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s not-timeless \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d both Shangela and BenDeLaCreme were crowned winners and, in a twist, each was given the chance to eliminate one of the bottom three queens. BenDeLaCreme eliminated Chi Chi, fine, and Shangela, who really did a supermarket sweep of this episode, milked the moment. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve chosen didn\u2019t leave with the crown, but they made a career,\u201d she said, teasing out what sounded like a Trixie elimination, only to reveal she\u2019d eliminated Chi Chi as well. (Warning shot: fired \u2014 and a sobbing Trixie clearly heard it.)\n\n\u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chi Chi said, waving. \u201cI\u2019m sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could,\u201d she added backstage, smiling. \u201c\u2018All Stars 3\u2019 was hard.\u201d\n\nFinally: a gracious exit. God, I love Chi Chi. Does she bake? If she can get to the U.K., and get a consistent layer of jam between two Victoria sponges, there\u2019s a show I\u2019d like to see her on.\n\nWill Shangela get played? Will Trixie finally triumph?

BeBe started out strong as the Virgin, a princess direct from Africa who kept kneeling at his feet but ran out of steam fast. Trixie, as the Fake Bitch, wrested a couple moments from Milk, who, as the Psycho Stalker, babbled and shrieked over her. (\u201cDon\u2019t talk over each other,\u201d Michelle Visage had cautioned beforehand.) Chi Chi and Shangela, as a polyamorous lesbian couple, were unspecific and out to sea.

Even funnier was Kennedy\u2019s raunchy Party Girl, who also had trouble getting out of the limo, and hid bottle service in her padding. \u201cWe gonna make a toast to love,\u201d she said as Mr. Bowyer-Chapman disrobed for a massage by the pool, and the camera swooped in for a thirsty \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d pan of his torso. Kennedy slathered him in lotion, went in for a sloppy kiss, and, before passing out drunk, added, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d (This tour de force should come as no surprise; her turn as Little Richard won her Season 7\u2019s Snatch Game.)\n\nThe runway challenge, Wigs on Wigs on Wigs, was inspired by the Season 5 runner-up Roxxxy Andrews\u2019s reveal of a second wig during a lip-sync. The queens scrambled to get ready, gluing down their eyebrows and predicting the bottom three. How fun, with everyone in earshot! Tell me when you\u2019re tired of this, but on the show with the amateur British bakers, if someone has extra time \u2014 say they\u2019ve gotten their bread dough in the proving drawer early, or their 3-D gingerbread story didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 they\u2019ll help other bakers, glaze things, get things from the fridge for them.\n\nOn the runway, BeBe, Shangela and Trixie were safe. In the bottom: Aja, whose three-wigged Kawaii look was the best of the night but didn\u2019t redeem her failed Needy Girl performance; mod-clad Milk, deservedly dragged for her one-note Psycho (if only they\u2019d seen the workroom footage); and Chi Chi, lovely on the runway but overshadowed in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Chi Chi tearfully told the judges, admitting the other queens\u2019 skills made her question her worth.\n\n\u201cChi Chi, you\u2019re worth it,\u201d the guest judge and pop-up life coach Constance Zimmer said.\n\nThe top two? BenDeLaCreme, for the third week in a row, and Kennedy, who announced backstage that she would forgo one-on-one appeals and decide who to eliminate on her own terms. BenDeLaCreme still kept office hours, though. Aja stopped by, knowing full well she wasn\u2019t going home \u2014 three wigs. Chi Chi shuffled over resignedly, as did Milk, who whispered, \u201cThe judges actually want me to continue in this.\u201d (What a choice: Chi Chi, a box of puppies, and Milk, a parking ticket.)\n\nA steady, inhabited lip-sync to Lorde\u2019s \u201cGreen Light\u201d won Kennedy the episode, and she eliminated Milk, who proved you can go big and go home.\n\nWill Chi Chi conquer her self-doubt?

The queens were assigned divas to impersonate \u2014 Trixie Mattel got Dolly Parton; Aja, Amy Winehouse; Thorgy Thor, Stevie Nicks \u2014 pairings that felt surprisingly considerate of each queen\u2019s strengths.\n\nThorgy, who admitted Ms. Nicks was one of her biggest inspirations, nevertheless bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, because that\u2019s what I was in Season 8,\u201d she said, before launching into a conspiracy theory: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being set up to fail.

The queens lip-synced to cloyingly impersonated covers of RuPaul\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 you know VH1 can afford 40 seconds of \u201cNasty,\u201d so this move felt particularly cynical \u2014 followed by a \u201cRudemption\u201d runway, where they spruced up disastrous looks from their previous stints on the show.\n\nIn the top were BenDeLaCreme, who rapped cheekily as Julie Andrews; BeBe Zahara Benet, who nailed Diana Ross; and Shangela, who hammed up Mariah Carey and strutted the runway in a giant, rolling bubble. In the bottom: Kennedy Davenport, who lip-synced messily; Thorgy, who, surprise, didn\u2019t quite commit; and, for reasons unclear to me, Chi Chi, who put across a great Patti LaBelle and wore a shapely runway outfit, after repeated criticism from the Season 8 judges for not wearing padding. (\u201cI just loved you in \u2018Eraser,\u2019\u201d Chi Chi gushed to guest judge Vanessa Williams. \u201c\u2018Eraser,\u2019 baby, \u2018Eraser.\u201d\u201d)\n\nDid Thorgy deserve a bottom spot as well? Not really, but the producers were clearly carving a narrative. Milk, on the other hand, was safe somehow, despite a snoozy-glam runway outing and, in the Divas Live challenge, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to Celine Dion. Backstage, she behaved ru-diculously, crying and cursing, while the others rubbernecked in bemused shock. \u201cI was in character the entire time and to not be commended for it, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Milk said. \u201cI hate this.\u201d (I mean, they know this is going to be on television, right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBenDeLaCreme and Shangela were named top two and faced off in a lip-sync to The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cJump (For My Love).\u201d BenDeLaCreme unzipped to a second look mid-song, but Shangela whipped out a jump rope and victory was hers, as was the task of eliminating either Kennedy or Thorgy, who\u2019d continued to grouse backstage and angle for alliances.

They acknowledge and internalize this in their confessionals, which are filmed in the nearby meadow. It is not boring TV.\n\nRuPaul popped on the workroom television to, yet again, coo ominous reassurances to Thorgy, while previous winners (and RuPaul handmaids) Chad Michaels and Alaska stalked up behind her.\n\nWhen Thorgy inevitably returns, will she be chastened?

Point guard Jerry Harkness was the star, an All-American who went on to play for the Knicks. Les Hunter and Vic Rouse dominated the boards.\n\nPhoto\n\nMississippi State, led by Leland Mitchell, was also a top 10 team. But while Loyola played a geographically diverse schedule, Mississippi State stayed in the South, playing only teams without black players. Indeed, Mississippi State had won the two previous Southeastern Conference titles, but it had turned down invitations to the N.C.A.A. tournament because of the probability of facing a team with black players.\n\nBefore the Game\n\nBy the end of the 1962-63 regular season, things were changing. Mississippi State\u2019s players and coaches wanted no more of the \u201cunwritten law\u201d and planned to prove themselves in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The university president, D.W. Colvard, announced that this time the team was in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLoyola won its preliminary game, 111-42, over Tennessee Tech, still the biggest margin ever in a tournament game. That set up the match against Mississippi State in the round of 16 in East Lansing, Mich.\n\nYet there were still plenty of people who did not want the game played. One of them was Mississippi\u2019s governor, Ross R. Barnett. In 1960, he had said of integrated sports: \u201cIf there were a half-dozen Negroes on the team, where are they going to eat? Are they going to want to go to the dance later and want to dance with our girls?\u201d\n\nA special meeting of the state college board was called. It voted, 8-3, to let the team play. Segregationists turned to the courts and won an injunction, but it was overturned by a state Supreme Court judge a day before the game.\n\nBut the team was still concerned about further legal action, to the point that it turned to subterfuge. The second string was sent to the Starkville airport first, as decoys, to draw out any lawyers wielding further injunctions. Had one arrived, the first team, hiding in their dormitory, would have been spirited away by some other method.\n\nBut when the coast was determined to be clear, the team flew to Michigan together. Coach Babe McCarthy had been sent out of state, to Nashville, and joined the team when its plane stopped there.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There were friendly handshakes before and after. Loyola got 20 points on 7-of-11 shooting by its star, Harkness, and 19 rebounds from Rouse to win by 61-51.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one incident,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cand not because we weren\u2019t trying or trying to be nice.\u201d\n\nAftermath\n\nLoyola kept it up, beating Illinois and then Duke at the Final Four in Louisville. In the championship game, its opponent was formidable: the two-time defending champion, Cincinnati, which had been No. 1 all year. Loyola, using only five players the whole game, rallied to tie the score on a last-second shot by Harkness.

The description, which has been used to dehumanize black people, set off protests at South African stores that left mannequins toppled and racks overturned.\n\nIn the aftermath, H&M chose a lawyer and company insider, Annie Wu, to lead a new four-person team at its Stockholm headquarters focused on global diversity and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cWe want to be held accountable,\u201d she said this week in her first interview since taking the job.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t recognize that in this now new age of transparency,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat the brand stands for is super important to people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLost in Translation\n\nFast fashion companies, which specialize in low-priced, quickly produced clothing and have grown faster than the apparel industry as a whole for years, are under pressure to be more prolific and provocative as they sell across more borders.\n\nH&M, which added 479 stores last year, now has more than 4,000 stores in dozens of countries.

In a statement at the time, he said that the frogs had \u201cno connection at all with anything related to hate, violence or discrimination.\u201d\n\nRicardo Cavolo, another artist who designed for the same collection, said in an email that the design process \u201cwas pretty fast.\u201d He spent two days at Zara\u2019s headquarters in Spain, creating paintings on denim that the company then reproduced without making any suggestions or changes, he said.\n\nSupply chain experts urge more careful, decentralized vetting procedures that send designs through a central checkpoint at headquarters and also past gatekeepers in the country of sale.\n\nSoon after shifting into her new role at H&M, Ms. Wu said, she visited South Africa, where the importance of soliciting local input quickly became clear.\n\n\u201cI thought I was very culturally aware,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in New York and speaks Mandarin. \u201cI learned so much more just by being in that office.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Homogeneous Work Force\n\nA few months ago, during a long day spent styling and photographing products for H&M\u2019s website, no one on the Stockholm set appeared to raise concerns about one more item to process, the hoodie with the offensive message, according to a person familiar with the shoot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics said the garment might have been flagged if H&M\u2019s team was more diverse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to avoid this kind of controversy,\u201d said Angel Sinclair, the founder of the advocacy group Models of Diversity. \u201cIf you care about being culturally sensitive, just be more culturally inclusive of talent and managers in the business.\u201d\n\nH&M has more than 100,000 workers worldwide.

And retail experts said that much of the creative process takes place in and around its European home office, far from many of its markets.\n\nMs. Wu, who reports directly to H&M\u2019s chief executive, Karl-Johan Persson, said she did not know the ethnic or racial backgrounds of the employees and contractors involved with the monkey hoodie. But an internal investigation of the incident \u2014 which she declined to discuss in detail \u2014 showed \u201chow important awareness-raising is generally,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of steps of getting a product to market \u2014 it\u2019s never one point in time where we can say, \u2018It\u2019s your fault,\u2019 because there are teams at work on things, there are approval processes throughout,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to pinpoint when.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Need for Speed\n\nH&M and Zara used to stun the industry with their ability to move garments from design to store floor within weeks, when other retailers required more than half a year.

Instead, \u201cPersonal Problems\u201d sits itself down at sidewalk cafes, in nightclub corners, at apartments where parties are celebrated and memorial gatherings attended. The setting is mostly Harlem, including Harlem Hospital where some of its characters work.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cPersonal Problems\u201d contains not a single shot that can be called beautiful, but there\u2019s also not a genuinely wrong-footed view in the whole work. It\u2019s as if the camera is negotiating with reality, trying to find a place at the characters\u2019 tables. The viewer gets a wide window into African-American life in New York at this time; it\u2019s intimate to the point of awkwardness. The title derives from what Ms. Brown, who works as a nurse (and is brought to spectacular, unaffected life by Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, the groundbreaking culinary anthropologist and writer) says in an onscreen interview at the opening of the work. Reflecting on her place in the city relative to South Carolina, from where she came, and how she related to a patient who came in with a bullet wound who was also from that state, she goes on: \u201cOf course everybody\u2019s got their own personal problems so you go home, you got the problems of home \u2026 I\u2019m tense, a lot of the time.\u201d The tensions are such that anyone can understand them, but this work is also about how the added dimension of being black in America increases stress.\n\nThis is hardly a humorless examination though. At a lunch, a group of women gossip snarkily; one recounts of a friend, \u201cShe said \u2018I\u2019m doing office work now,\u2019 guess what, she means she was cleaning offices.\u201d There\u2019s a boisterous, querulous argument in the back room of a bar between characters played by Mr. Reed and Kip Hanrahan, the recording artist and musical impresario; Mr. Hanrahan\u2019s white radical posture generates no small amusement. The movie shows the personal as political while never overtly insisting on the point.\n\nThis is a work that looks as if it were evolving even as portions of it were completed.

On the evening of March 18, two officers from the Sacramento Police Department were dispatched to investigate a complaint that someone was breaking vehicle windows.\n\nPhoto\n\nA helicopter from the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department was also hovering over the scene looking for a potential suspect when it identified a man with a crowbar heading toward a nearby house.\n\nA few minutes after responding to the call, with the apparent guidance from the sheriff\u2019s helicopter, the city police officers spotted Mr. Clark, who they said ran from them. They followed him into the backyard and ordered him to show his hands, police video shows. Seconds later, in the dark, one officer shouted, \u201cgun, gun, gun, gun!\u201d and they shot 20 times at Mr. Clark. The officers believed Mr. Clark had a weapon and opened fire \u201cfearing for their lives,\u201d according to a police statement.\n\nThe entire encounter lasted roughly 10 minutes. The officers looked for a gun but all they found was a cellphone.\n\nVideo\n\nMinutes later more officers arrived and the team handcuffed Mr. Clark, who lay mortally wounded.\n\nAs other officers arrived, the two involved in the shooting muted the audio feeds to their body cameras. One of the officers was black and the other was white. They are both on paid leave, Mr. Hahn said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTimothy Davis, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, called the event a tragedy and voiced his support for the officers involved. \u201cNo police officer ever wants to have to take a life,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cOur officers are out there serving this community, leaving their family behind to serve this community.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if the decision to mute the cameras went against official protocol, but the act alone has prompted intense suspicion. The Clark family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the move \u201creeks of impropriety\u201d and that the Police Department was trying to cover something up. Mr. Crump represented the families of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012, and Michael Brown, killed by the police in Ferguson two years later.\n\nMr. Hahn said that the department could not explain why the officers muted their cameras, but that the officers\u2019s actions were under investigation. The department had been considering banning muting cameras outright before Mr. Clark was shot, he said.\n\n\u201cIn their training they are told a couple different instances when they can mute their body cameras. The bigger ongoing question that we are already looking into and revising our policy is: Are those reasons acceptable?\u201d Mr. Hahn said. \u201cShould we continue to allow people to mute those cameras for those reasons?\u201d\n\nDozens attended the wake for Mr. Clark on Wednesday and hundreds are expected to attend his funeral on Thursday, including activists from outside the city and from the Black Lives Matters movement, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. More vigils and protests are planned in cities across the country in the coming days.\n\nAnger over Mr. Clark\u2019s death has not let up in the days since the shooting. For four hours on Tuesday night hundreds of residents gathered at a Sacramento City Council meeting to complain that Mr. Clark\u2019s death was just the latest in a long list of injustices against the black residents.\n\nLate last year, a young black man was punched by a county police officer repeatedly during a jaywalking stop. Video of the attack attracted widespread attention on social media and the county later settled a lawsuit in response.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Later, they blocked entry to another Sacramento Kings game.\n\nMs. Faison said the body-camera video of Mr. Clark\u2019s death, which the police released in the days after the shooting, painted a damning portrait of the police.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just disgusting, honestly. That video. I don\u2019t even know. I feel like they started shooting before they even looked at him. It looked like they were coming around the corner shooting and he was walking toward them to see what the noise was,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would you fly a helicopter for someone breaking into cars?\u201d\n\nMayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento, who has received the brunt of the criticism and led the council meeting, said in an interview Wednesday that he was sympathetic to the complaints and that people of color in Sacramento have genuine grievances about the police.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the outcome of the investigation, which will be based on the current laws and the current policies and the current training, what happened here, the outcome, was plain wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cA 22-year-old man should not have died in this way.\u201d", "keywords": ["shots", "killing", "reignites", "20", "hahn", "stephon", "york", "clark", "department", "sacramento", "later", "mr", "officers", "furor", "cameras", "sign"], "polarity": 0.01726556101556102, "subjectivity": 0.40237168987168964},

Harper, the Conservative prime minister at the time, apologized on behalf of the government and established the reconciliation commission.\n\nChief Bellegarde said that the pope\u2019s direct apology in 2015 during a trip to Bolivia for \u201cgrave sins\u201d committed by the church against Indigenous people in the Americas gave him confidence that a similar apology over residential schools was still possible.\n\nThe schools operated from 1883 until the last one closed in 1998. The commission found that children were severely punished for speaking Indigenous languages or following their cultural practices. It concluded that 3,201 students died while in the schools, often from mistreatment or neglect. About 80,000 former students are still alive.\n\nPope Francis has tried to decentralize authority away from the Vatican and giving more authority to local bishops. And while some in the Vatican bristle at the notion that the pope should have to answer to a request of a secular government, the more important factor could be what guidance came from the bishops in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe big question is what is the position of the Canadian bishops on this,\u201d said Thomas Reese, a veteran Vatican watcher and senior analyst at Religion News Service. \u201cIf the bishops are saying \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 he is getting mixed signals and he tends to support the local bishops.\u201d Mr. Reese added that \u201cfor him to turn down the bishops and the government, that would be noteworthy.\u201d\n\nSome in the Vatican have worried about the legal implications of apologies in cases with potentially large damages. About 50 Catholic organizations agreed to a financial settlement in the case of residential schools but were unable to raise enough money to fully cover the commitment. A 2015 court ruling released them from fulfilling the agreement.\n\nYet popes have recently made a habit of public apologies.\n\nAfter apologizing for Catholic involvement in the slave trade, the church\u2019s treatment of Jews and treating Galileo as a heretic, Pope John Paul II issued in 2000 a sweeping blanket request for forgiveness for the church\u2019s sins over the past 2,000 years. \u201cRecognizing the deviations of the past serves to reawaken our consciences to the compromises of the present,\u201d John Paul II said.\n\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI apologized with \u201cshame and remorse\u201d to the victims of decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland.\n\nIn addition to his apology in Bolivia, Francis asked for forgiveness in 2017 for the church\u2019s role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. As recently as January, Francis apologized to Chilean victims of abuse, though he created a larger problem for himself and his pontificate when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up that abuse.\n\nThe letter to Canada\u2019s Indigenous people said the pope was considering a trip to Canada and would make meeting Indigenous people a priority in the event of a visit.", "keywords": ["sign", "york", "francis", "indigenous", "bishops", "rejects", "apology", "churchs", "pope", "canadas", "schools", "vatican"], "polarity": 0.05400571650571651, "subjectivity": 0.30693958818958816},

I had developed a relationship with her since her days as an activist in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown. Ms. Yates didn\u2019t hold back with me: She has already been open on social media about her struggles within the movement and had a very public falling out with its leaders.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Ms. Garner had a heart attack last year and later died; while she was in a coma, Ms. Yates shared an image on Instagram of a text message exchange in which Ms. Yates encouraged Ms. Garner to not be bothered by people talking negatively about her on social media.\n\n\u201cI have to make clear just how invisible some of the most heinous violence we experience is,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in the Instagram post in December. \u201cHow we are often left alone on the front lines grown cold because media and figureheads move on to the next hot story.\u201d\n\nI asked Ms. Yates, who moved to Oakland a couple of years back to work as an activist full time, if she ever had the urge to just say forget it, and take her college degree and go into a traditional profession. Of course she did, she told me, especially when you see someone dropping dead at 27 of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely scary,\u201d said Ms. Yates, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you want to quit.\u201d\n\nBut more than just reflecting on the difficulties of activism and the trauma that comes with it, Ms. Yates ventured into another area that I had not thought about: self-care.\n\nAs it turns out, taking care of yourself is a big issue in the present movement, unlike in times past. There are trained \u201chealers\u201d in communities who run workshops and do private counseling for activists. Ms. Yates started seeing a therapist about a year ago. She also talked about the things that seem small but can make a big difference for her: going to the ocean, putting her toes in sand, remembering to eat, taking time to talk with her friends about things that have nothing to do with activism. Some of these might seem obvious, but for those immersed in the work, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nAs one reader commented on the story, young activists should temper their expectations for immediate results \u201cand put their personal health first in order to reduce their toxic levels of stress.\u201d\n\nBecause, he added, \u201cstress can kill; emotionally and spiritually, as well as physically.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "social", "yates", "black", "work", "movement", "lives", "taking", "casualties", "quiet", "times", "garner", "things", "sign", "ms"], "polarity": 0.027650363820576594, "subjectivity": 0.3347075619416045},
{"title": "\n                    \u2018He Is Not a Victim\u2019: Our Austin Bomber Coverage Explained                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/reader-center/austin-bomber-media-coverage.html", "text": "In the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people, law enforcement officials called Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook terrorists. The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim! When a POC is the victim they are treated far worse than this \u201cgodly boy\u201d whom we are lucky didn\u2019t kill more people with his bombs. Imagine if he was Muslim. \u2014 Tyrone Dockery When it\u2019s a white kid, we are quick to throw out the \u201cmisguided\u201d or \u201cseverely disturbed\u201d or whatever linkage to their mental state \u2014 TBunkNasty Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.\u201d He was African-American.\n\nWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New York\n\nCarolyn Ryan, Assistant Managing Editor: We have aggressively pushed to recruit more people of color, and last year, more than a third of our newsroom hires were people of color, and 60 percent were women. We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out? Open your eyes. \u2014 Hannah Drake\n\nHanna Ingber, Reader Center\u2019s Editorial Director: Thank you for your comment. I see how it came across that way and do understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nWe invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.\n\nAdditional Reader Points\n\nIn responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/charleston-international-african-american-museum.html", "text": "Right here. The spot used to be Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. Historians estimate nearly half of all African slaves brought to America arrived in Charleston, most of them at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. At 840-feet-long, it was, two centuries ago, the largest wharf in America. Thousands of Africans waited in the wharf\u2019s warehouses to be auctioned off.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn what has become a parking lot, just inland, 700 of them froze to death.\n\nFor millions of African-Americans today, the site is \u201cground zero,\u201d as the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has put it, for \u201cblackness, black culture, the African experience, the African-American experience, slavery \u2014 however you want to slice it.\u201d\n\nEvery era erects, removes, amends \u2014 or ignores \u2014 monuments. Monuments and historical museums are always mirrors, advertisements, time bombs. Hardly a street or building in Germany today lacks some sign or plaque, redressing the past. It was the proposed removal of a Jim Crow-era statue of Robert E. Lee that became the excuse for the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, where a white nationalist is to go on trial late this year in the murder of a protester at the event.\n\nUnlike Virginia, South Carolina hasn\u2019t taken down Confederate monuments. Much has changed here but much has not. The state\u2019s most recent proposal for social studies standards in public schools doesn\u2019t mention the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks.\n\nThe Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a young white man massacred nine black congregants in 2015 is virtually in the shadow of what\u2019s still the city\u2019s tallest monument (another Jim Crow relic) of the antebellum vice president and proud white supremacist John C. Calhoun.\n\nIt has been nearly two decades since Joseph P. Riley Jr., Charleston\u2019s mayor at the time, floated the idea of a museum of African-American culture and history, on a different site, nearby. A dozen years passed, then more.\n\nMr. Riley retired in 2016, after 40 years in office, having been elected during the 1970s as a racial bridge builder. White racists called him \u201cL\u2019il Black Joe\u201d when he appointed a black police chief in 1975. Charleston prospered over the intervening decades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut gentrification had its effects. Two-thirds black in the early 1980s, the population has become 70 percent white. I suggested to Mr. Riley the other day that Charleston can come across to a visitor as Disneyland for the Confederacy, still enthralled by its era of slavery, with a monument on seemingly every downtown corner commemorating some Confederate soldier, plantation aristocrat or antebellum judge who opposed Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe worked hard while I was mayor to avoid alienation, to make this a city where everyone feels welcome. When I was in school, they didn\u2019t teach us about slavery. I really only learned the truth about how slaves were treated when I had already been in office for many years. That\u2019s when I began to think seriously about the museum.\u201d\n\nBut without enough money or much public enthusiasm, the plan sputtered. Then excavations turned up traces of Gadsden\u2019s Wharf in the muck beneath the grassy lot. Through the exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum, Mr. Riley reached out to Mr. Cobb.\n\nPretty much the architect\u2019s first question: Why not build on the location of the wharf?\n\nBy that point, the city had sold the property to a local restaurateur, unaware of its history. Mr. Riley spent a tidy sum buying the land back.\n\n\u201cSometimes you quick-cook something, it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d rationalized the former mayor, who has taken to calling the museum his \u201cmost important work,\u201d especially after the church murders. \u201cIt turned out to be good that we had a lengthy germination period.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Working here with the structural engineer Guy Nordenson, he describes this project as an \u201cunrhetorical work of architecture.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite true. On the edge of the cobblestoned tourist area, with its ornate Gothic Revival-style churches and Queen Anne houses, the museum\u2019s plain-spoken modernism comes across as almost whisperingly defiant, a turning of the page, promising a deliverance from history, modernism\u2019s originating goal.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoody Nolan are the architects of record. Slender brick cladding underscores the pavilion\u2019s long horizontal spans and extended cantilevers on either end. Pointed columns are meant to make the structure\u2019s mass appear to float. Perching the museum on piers will take account of rising waters. But it\u2019s also hard not to see an allusion to a wharf.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside, galleries will document the many diverse cultures Africans brought to America, and a family center will let visitors trace their roots to Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Hood has reimagined a constrained and narrow property, about a football-field long. The late, great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer was an inspiration. Mr. Hood creates a shaded public plaza, in the breezy space underneath the raised structure, where people may congregate around the building\u2019s double-sided staircase, so the museum can become a gathering spot, not just a pilgrimage site.\n\nThe memorial garden and tidal pool, at the same time, insure that it\u2019s recognized as hallowed ground, a place for contemplation.\n\nThe budget for building the museum is $75 million. The goal is for bulldozers to start digging later this year and for construction to finish in 2020. But there\u2019s a hitch. No shovel will be lifted until all the money is raised. Charleston has committed its $25 million share, along with the land, and private donations are approaching the $25 million goal.\n\nBut the South Carolina legislature, after an understanding that it would contribute $25 million over five years, allocated $14 million, and now won\u2019t promise the remaining $11 million. The clock is ticking. The current legislature remains in session only until the end of May.\n\nState Representative Brian White, a Republican who heads South Carolina\u2019s House Ways and Means Committee, is one of those holding the money back. The museum \u201cis not a state project and we have a lot of state needs right now that far outweigh a municipality\u2019s request,\u201d he recently told the Greenville News, citing competing priorities like education.\n\nBobby Hitt, South Carolina\u2019s commerce secretary, by contrast, has pointed out that the museum will help attract businesses to the state. It adds a work of architectural dignity. And as for educational value, plainly it fills a gap.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t a black project,\u201d as Bakari Sellers, a former Democrat in the state legislature, put it to the Greenville News. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a Charleston project.

Mr. Moore said his ancestors were among the slaves who arrived in shackles at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nHis great-great grandfather was Robert Smalls, who commandeered a Confederate ship, turning it over to Union forces and winning freedom for himself, his family and his crew. Smalls became a crusading state legislator and United States congressman during Reconstruction. He brought free public education to South Carolina.\n\nA plaque honoring Smalls was installed on a squat little pillar downtown not long ago. Mr. Moore showed me a picture of it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThink, the Stonehenge set from \u201cSpinal Tap.\u201d The memorial looks tiny, and is periodically obscured by bushes.\n\nNot far away, a big statue on a huge round pedestal, at the tip of the battery facing Fort Sumter, honors the Confederate Defenders of Charleston.\n\nSymbols matter.

But the idea that secularism means the separation of church and state \u201cis an old idea\u201d that has been challenged by scholars for about the last 20 years, she said.\n\nThese scholars now argue that the condition of secularism is in fact one in which the state has become \u201cmore and more involved in the regulation of religious life and religious institutions,\u201d she said.\n\nThus, when Islamic movements struggle to make the state their means to Islamicize society, they\u2019re in line with this modern conception of secularism, Professor Mahmood maintained.\n\n\u201cEven in America, Protestantism is a very crucial aspect that informs almost all laws and practices,\u201d she said.\n\nHer work has been translated into Arabic, French, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and Polish.\n\nSaba Mahmood was born on Feb. 3, 1961, in Quetta, Pakistan, to Mahmood Hussein, a policeman, and Latif Begum, a homemaker.\n\nMs. Mahmood moved to the United States in 1981 to study architecture and urban planning at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Samuel Cohen, 74, who was at the march with his wife, L\u00e9a, 70, was one of several who carried a sign that read, \u201cIn France, we kill grandmothers because they\u2019re Jewish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a little exaggerated to say that we are not safe in France today,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cYet it\u2019s true that we are worried, that it\u2019s become hard to practice one\u2019s faith in some areas, and that we\u2019ve reached a new degree of anti-Semitism with this murder.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials attended the march, as did representatives of France\u2019s main political parties, including the head of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen. She has been trying to shed her party\u2019s racist and anti-Semitic past, but was booed at the march.\n\nIn 2015, she kicked Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 her father, and a founder of the National Front \u2014 out of the party for reiterating comments he had made previously that dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail of World War II history.\u201d\n\nThe Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, one of the largest Jewish advocacy groups here, known by its French initials C.R.I.F., said ahead of the march that neither the far-left nor the far-right was welcome to join, arguing that anti-Semites were \u201coverrepresented\u201d on both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nBut Daniel Knoll, one of Ms. Knoll\u2019s two sons, said on Wednesday that everyone could come.\n\n\u201cThe C.R.I.F. is playing politics, and I am opening my heart,\u201d Mr. Knoll said on the French news channel BFM TV. \u201cI open my heart to everybody, everyone who has a mother \u2014 which means everybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbearable, today in France, to know that someone can die like this, in such an atrocious way,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Knoll was stabbed 11 times, and her body was found partly burned after her attackers tried to set her apartment on fire.

Shortly after he was confirmed last year, Mr. Carson tried to reverse an Obama-era program that would make it easier for recipients of housing vouchers to use them in affluent neighborhoods.\n\nThe move was struck down by the courts, and Mr. Carson abandoned the effort.\n\nLast week, Mr. Carson told members of the Senate Banking Committee that he planned to delay another Obama-era rule that would have required local governments to create detailed plans to integrate racially divided neighborhoods.\n\nAnd a provision barring localities from using federal funding to undertake such programs was stealthily inserted into the 2018 spending plan passed last week by Congress.\n\nDespite these moves, Mr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the department was merely \u201clooking to streamline\u201d its enforcement efforts and to focus on new, neglected areas of discrimination.\n\n\u201cThere is no mission shift. We are, in fact, putting more emphasis in sexual harassment\u201d complaints, Mr. Brown wrote in an email. \u201cIn addition, 60 percent of the fair housing complaints we receive are disability related, and the majority of those have to do with service animals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most significant fight over fair housing under Mr. Trump is taking place in Houston, a sprawling metropolis ranked in numerous studies as one of the United States\u2019 most segregated cities, where overt opposition to a housing development based on race and income has drawn the attention of career HUD investigators.\n\nIn January 2017, before Mr. Obama left office, HUD lawyers accused Houston officials of violating fair housing requirements cited in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The city\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, had killed a 233-unit mixed-income, mixed-race housing development slated for an affluent white area known for its high-end shopping and excellent schools.\n\nHUD told the city to undertake specific remedies as a condition of continued funding, including the approval of the development, known as the Fountain View Project, and the adoption of tough new zoning laws.\n\nIn a scathing letter, HUD officials accused Mr. Turner, who is African-American, of succumbing to \u201cracially motivated local opposition,\u201d claiming that he caved to protests by white business owners and residents.\n\nMr. Turner has denied the accusation, arguing that he opposed the development because only 23 apartments were set aside for low-income families. He also objected to the idea of forced integration, putting him in agreement with Mr. Carson.\n\n\u201cI have chosen to stay in the neighborhood where I grew up, and I will not tell children in similar communities they must live somewhere else,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who grew up in an all-black development.\n\nBut he might have had other reasons for opposing the project. In one meeting, Mr. Turner privately admitted that he hoped his position on the project would coax white Republican state legislators to support a bill needed to restructure Houston\u2019s ailing pension system, according to a former federal official who attended the meeting.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe mayor denied that account.\n\n\u201cHe never told anyone he opposed the Fountain View Project to win votes for his pension overhaul,\u201d said Mary Benton, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, few Democrats have done quite so well in negotiating with the Trump administration as Mr. Turner, who began pressing Mr. Carson to release the city from the order shortly after Mr. Carson was confirmed.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, with Mr. Carson\u2019s blessing, began negotiating directly with Mr. Turner and other city officials. She largely excluded the career lawyers who had already begun drafting a tougher order \u2014 one that required the city to pay the Houston Housing Authority, Fountain View\u2019s developer, as much as $14 million if it insisted on blocking the deal, according to an official in Houston.\n\nBut Mr. Turner, who believes the case to be a distraction from his city\u2019s rebuilding effort, prevailed.\n\nThis month, Ms. Far\u00edas signed a new, less stringent agreement that other Houston officials eager to get federal money flowing into hard-hit neighborhoods \u2014 including Representative Al Green, a Democrat and harsh Carson critic \u2014 hailed as a victory.\n\nBut a coalition of local advocacy groups and national organizations are suing to block the disbursement of $5 billion in HUD recovery money unless the city abides by civil rights-era fair housing laws.\n\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, then damn it, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d said John Henneberger, a director of Texas Housers, an advocacy group that filed a lawsuit last week in Federal District Court to enforce the original HUD letter.\n\n\u201cFountain View was kind of the last stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent eight or nine years documenting systematic and pervasive racial discrimination in Houston \u2014 it is an open-and-shut case.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the agreement required the city to \u201cput in place new procedures for the building of affordable housing\u201d and a study on how to increase affordable housing in the city\u2019s Galleria district, where Fountain View was to be built.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are other signs of change within HUD that could make it far less likely that similar cases would ever be pursued.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, according to six current department officials, has told HUD managers that she intends to replace her top subordinate, Timothy Smyth, who played a central role in the Houston case. Bryan Greene, another senior manager, will be reassigned as part of the shake-up, the officials said.\n\nMr. Brown, in an email, said no one had been reassigned yet \u2014 but he added that it was \u201cwell within the assistant secretary\u2019s authority after 120 days to reassign senior-level personnel.\u201d\n\nMorale at the division is sinking. At a meeting this month of HUD regional housing directors in Atlanta, Ms. Far\u00edas \u2014 a former vice chairwoman of the Bexar County, Tex., Republicans and a Trump campaign supporter \u2014 told one of the directors that she preferred older HUD employees because they were more likely to have had experience working for Republican administrations.\n\nEarlier, according to two aides who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, she had told her staff that it was her intention to root out people she viewed as \u201cObama plants.\u201d\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, through a spokesman, denied making those statements.", "keywords": ["according", "hud", "turner", "far\u00edas", "enforcement", "carson", "mr", "ben", "fair", "housing", "city", "officials", "scales"], "polarity": 0.1182145015478349, "subjectivity": 0.44603205436538773},

(Dozens of people died in the 1919 riot in Chicago.)\n\nThe Chicago Commission on Human Rights (formerly the Mayor\u2019s Commission on Race Relations), which was established after the June 1943 Detroit riot, urged newspaper editors to play down the discord, including an August 1947 attack on black veterans in the Fernwood Park neighborhood and a November 1949 riot that broke out in the Englewood district over rumors that African-Americans were looking to buy in the neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThanks to television, the violence burst into full view in July 1951, when a crowd of at least 2,000 and possibly as many as 5,000 whites in the suburb of Cicero attacked an apartment building after one black family had moved into one of its 20 units. Later that decade, schools, playgrounds, parks and beaches became the sites of racial conflict.\n\nAmbitious programs, billed as \u201curban renewal,\u201d in South Side neighborhoods like Hyde Park-Kenwood and Lake Meadows reinforced segregation. Black politicians, like Representative William L. Dawson, the first African-American to be named chairman of a congressional committee, were muted in their opposition to such projects, partly because they were beneficiaries of the patronage of the city\u2019s entrenched Democratic machine.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs deprived cities of vital tax revenues, exacerbating the problems of the poor neighborhoods.\n\nProfessor Hirsch likened the process of ghetto creation and maintenance to the \u201ccontainment\u201d policies that sought to curb communist expansion abroad during the Cold War. He insisted that the urban crises of the 1960s and \u201970s had not been the fault of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs, which some characterized as liberal excesses, but rather had originated in decisions made a generation earlier.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe compounded shortcomings of slum clearance, urban renewal and segregated high-rise public housing resulted not from an unfettered liberalism\u2019s social experimentation during the civil rights era, but, rather, from a conservative reaction more emblematic of the 1950s and the Cold War,\u201d Professor Hirsch wrote in 1997 in a new foreword to the book.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe \u2018second ghetto\u2019 did not just happen.

He grew up in the West Rogers Park section of Chicago, graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1970 and received a Ph.D. in history, from the same institution, in 1978.\n\nThere, he studied with Gilbert Osofsky, the author of \u201cHarlem: The Making of a Ghetto\u201d (1963), who, until his death at 39 in 1974, was a mentor to Professor Hirsch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Hirsch began teaching history at the University of New Orleans in 1970 and was an emeritus professor there at his death.

But it was dropped from the 1960 general census (there was no census in 1965) and relegated in 1970 to a longer list of questions that were asked of a small minority of residents. After 2000, the question was asked only on the American Community Survey, a separate mandatory poll of a fraction of the population that is conducted more frequently than the census.\n\nCritics noted that the citizenship question was added at the last minute \u2014 the deadline for proposing new questions for the 2020 head count is April 1 \u2014 and that it sidestepped the years of vetting undergone by every other question that will be asked.

Tens of thousands of forms mailed to local residents this month do not contain the citizenship question.\n\nExperts dismissed Mr. Ross\u2019s statement that the citizenship question did not need further testing, arguing that the census and the American Community Survey differ in almost every aspect, from size to public awareness to whether a response is required. \u201cWhen you do this once every 10 years, for 340 million people, you\u2019ve got to get it right,\u201d said William H. Frey, a University of Michigan demographer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, critics of Mr. Ross\u2019s decision made available a letter sent to Mr. Ross in January from six former directors of the Census Bureau who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The letter stated that they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that adding the citizenship question would \u201cconsiderably increase the risks to the 2020 enumeration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of evidence that even small changes in survey question order, wording and instructions can have significant, and often unexpected, consequences for the rate, quality and truthfulness of response,\u201d said the former directors, who included Mr. Prewitt. \u201cThe effect of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census on data quality and census accuracy, therefore, is completely unknown.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the states suing the Trump administration are run by Democrats, who risk losing representation if the census undercounts people of color.\n\nCarmen Queveda, an undocumented immigrant in Los Angeles, said on Tuesday she was not about to step out of her house to participate in a census that inquires whether she is a citizen.\n\n\u201cI would never answer, because I don\u2019t have papers,\u201d said the 46-year-old native of Guatemala, who is also the mother of a 14-year-old American boy. \u201cObviously, I am afraid. I have a son.\u201d\n\nThe last official estimate of the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States, made in 2012 by the Department of Homeland Security, placed the number at 11.4 million.\n\nAt a morning E.S.L. class in Queens, N.Y., at Sunnyside Community Services, about 30 students hailing from Spanish-speaking countries, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, were asked about the citizenship question by Johan Lopez, New York City\u2019s director of adult and immigrant services. Mr. Lopez said their answer alarmed him.\n\n\u201cI asked them directly how this would affect their ability to respond or whether they would even open the door,\u201d he said. All but one \u201csuggested that they likely wouldn\u2019t open the door.\u201d", "keywords": ["administration", "york", "citizenship", "bureau", "census", "mr", "trump", "community", "2020", "american", "question", "sue", "asked", "states"], "polarity": 0.07303377692266583, "subjectivity": 0.4370859387526053},

Les Hunter and Vic Rouse dominated the boards.\n\nPhoto\n\nMississippi State, led by Leland Mitchell, was also a top 10 team. But while Loyola played a geographically diverse schedule, Mississippi State stayed in the South, playing only teams without black players. Indeed, Mississippi State had won the two previous Southeastern Conference titles, but it had turned down invitations to the N.C.A.A. tournament because of the probability of facing a team with black players.\n\nBefore the Game\n\nBy the end of the 1962-63 regular season, things were changing. Mississippi State\u2019s players and coaches wanted no more of the \u201cunwritten law\u201d and planned to prove themselves in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The university president, D.W.

That set up the match against Mississippi State in the round of 16 in East Lansing, Mich.\n\nYet there were still plenty of people who did not want the game played. One of them was Mississippi\u2019s governor, Ross R. Barnett. In 1960, he had said of integrated sports: \u201cIf there were a half-dozen Negroes on the team, where are they going to eat? Are they going to want to go to the dance later and want to dance with our girls?\u201d\n\nA special meeting of the state college board was called. It voted, 8-3, to let the team play. Segregationists turned to the courts and won an injunction, but it was overturned by a state Supreme Court judge a day before the game.\n\nBut the team was still concerned about further legal action, to the point that it turned to subterfuge. The second string was sent to the Starkville airport first, as decoys, to draw out any lawyers wielding further injunctions. Had one arrived, the first team, hiding in their dormitory, would have been spirited away by some other method.\n\nBut when the coast was determined to be clear, the team flew to Michigan together. Coach Babe McCarthy had been sent out of state, to Nashville, and joined the team when its plane stopped there.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At a lunch, a group of women gossip snarkily; one recounts of a friend, \u201cShe said \u2018I\u2019m doing office work now,\u2019 guess what, she means she was cleaning offices.\u201d There\u2019s a boisterous, querulous argument in the back room of a bar between characters played by Mr. Reed and Kip Hanrahan, the recording artist and musical impresario; Mr. Hanrahan\u2019s white radical posture generates no small amusement. The movie shows the personal as political while never overtly insisting on the point.\n\nThis is a work that looks as if it were evolving even as portions of it were completed.

On the evening of March 18, two officers from the Sacramento Police Department were dispatched to investigate a complaint that someone was breaking vehicle windows.\n\nPhoto\n\nA helicopter from the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department was also hovering over the scene looking for a potential suspect when it identified a man with a crowbar heading toward a nearby house.\n\nA few minutes after responding to the call, with the apparent guidance from the sheriff\u2019s helicopter, the city police officers spotted Mr. Clark, who they said ran from them. They followed him into the backyard and ordered him to show his hands, police video shows. Seconds later, in the dark, one officer shouted, \u201cgun, gun, gun, gun!\u201d and they shot 20 times at Mr. Clark. The officers believed Mr. Clark had a weapon and opened fire \u201cfearing for their lives,\u201d according to a police statement.\n\nThe entire encounter lasted roughly 10 minutes. The officers looked for a gun but all they found was a cellphone.\n\nVideo\n\nMinutes later more officers arrived and the team handcuffed Mr. Clark, who lay mortally wounded.\n\nAs other officers arrived, the two involved in the shooting muted the audio feeds to their body cameras. One of the officers was black and the other was white. They are both on paid leave, Mr. Hahn said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTimothy Davis, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, called the event a tragedy and voiced his support for the officers involved. \u201cNo police officer ever wants to have to take a life,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cOur officers are out there serving this community, leaving their family behind to serve this community.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if the decision to mute the cameras went against official protocol, but the act alone has prompted intense suspicion. The Clark family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the move \u201creeks of impropriety\u201d and that the Police Department was trying to cover something up. Mr. Crump represented the families of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012, and Michael Brown, killed by the police in Ferguson two years later.\n\nMr. Hahn said that the department could not explain why the officers muted their cameras, but that the officers\u2019s actions were under investigation. The department had been considering banning muting cameras outright before Mr. Clark was shot, he said.\n\n\u201cIn their training they are told a couple different instances when they can mute their body cameras. The bigger ongoing question that we are already looking into and revising our policy is: Are those reasons acceptable?\u201d Mr. Hahn said. \u201cShould we continue to allow people to mute those cameras for those reasons?\u201d\n\nDozens attended the wake for Mr. Clark on Wednesday and hundreds are expected to attend his funeral on Thursday, including activists from outside the city and from the Black Lives Matters movement, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. More vigils and protests are planned in cities across the country in the coming days.\n\nAnger over Mr. Clark\u2019s death has not let up in the days since the shooting. For four hours on Tuesday night hundreds of residents gathered at a Sacramento City Council meeting to complain that Mr. Clark\u2019s death was just the latest in a long list of injustices against the black residents.\n\nLate last year, a young black man was punched by a county police officer repeatedly during a jaywalking stop. Video of the attack attracted widespread attention on social media and the county later settled a lawsuit in response.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Later, they blocked entry to another Sacramento Kings game.\n\nMs. Faison said the body-camera video of Mr. Clark\u2019s death, which the police released in the days after the shooting, painted a damning portrait of the police.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just disgusting, honestly.

Harper, the Conservative prime minister at the time, apologized on behalf of the government and established the reconciliation commission.\n\nChief Bellegarde said that the pope\u2019s direct apology in 2015 during a trip to Bolivia for \u201cgrave sins\u201d committed by the church against Indigenous people in the Americas gave him confidence that a similar apology over residential schools was still possible.\n\nThe schools operated from 1883 until the last one closed in 1998. The commission found that children were severely punished for speaking Indigenous languages or following their cultural practices. It concluded that 3,201 students died while in the schools, often from mistreatment or neglect. About 80,000 former students are still alive.\n\nPope Francis has tried to decentralize authority away from the Vatican and giving more authority to local bishops. And while some in the Vatican bristle at the notion that the pope should have to answer to a request of a secular government, the more important factor could be what guidance came from the bishops in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe big question is what is the position of the Canadian bishops on this,\u201d said Thomas Reese, a veteran Vatican watcher and senior analyst at Religion News Service. \u201cIf the bishops are saying \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 he is getting mixed signals and he tends to support the local bishops.\u201d Mr. Reese added that \u201cfor him to turn down the bishops and the government, that would be noteworthy.\u201d\n\nSome in the Vatican have worried about the legal implications of apologies in cases with potentially large damages. About 50 Catholic organizations agreed to a financial settlement in the case of residential schools but were unable to raise enough money to fully cover the commitment. A 2015 court ruling released them from fulfilling the agreement.\n\nYet popes have recently made a habit of public apologies.\n\nAfter apologizing for Catholic involvement in the slave trade, the church\u2019s treatment of Jews and treating Galileo as a heretic, Pope John Paul II issued in 2000 a sweeping blanket request for forgiveness for the church\u2019s sins over the past 2,000 years. \u201cRecognizing the deviations of the past serves to reawaken our consciences to the compromises of the present,\u201d John Paul II said.\n\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI apologized with \u201cshame and remorse\u201d to the victims of decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland.\n\nIn addition to his apology in Bolivia, Francis asked for forgiveness in 2017 for the church\u2019s role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. As recently as January, Francis apologized to Chilean victims of abuse, though he created a larger problem for himself and his pontificate when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up that abuse.\n\nThe letter to Canada\u2019s Indigenous people said the pope was considering a trip to Canada and would make meeting Indigenous people a priority in the event of a visit.", "keywords": ["sign", "york", "francis", "indigenous", "bishops", "rejects", "apology", "churchs", "pope", "canadas", "schools", "vatican"], "polarity": 0.05400571650571651, "subjectivity": 0.30693958818958816},

Ms. Garner had a heart attack last year and later died; while she was in a coma, Ms. Yates shared an image on Instagram of a text message exchange in which Ms. Yates encouraged Ms. Garner to not be bothered by people talking negatively about her on social media.\n\n\u201cI have to make clear just how invisible some of the most heinous violence we experience is,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in the Instagram post in December. \u201cHow we are often left alone on the front lines grown cold because media and figureheads move on to the next hot story.\u201d\n\nI asked Ms. Yates, who moved to Oakland a couple of years back to work as an activist full time, if she ever had the urge to just say forget it, and take her college degree and go into a traditional profession. Of course she did, she told me, especially when you see someone dropping dead at 27 of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely scary,\u201d said Ms. Yates, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you want to quit.\u201d\n\nBut more than just reflecting on the difficulties of activism and the trauma that comes with it, Ms. Yates ventured into another area that I had not thought about: self-care.\n\nAs it turns out, taking care of yourself is a big issue in the present movement, unlike in times past. There are trained \u201chealers\u201d in communities who run workshops and do private counseling for activists. Ms. Yates started seeing a therapist about a year ago. She also talked about the things that seem small but can make a big difference for her: going to the ocean, putting her toes in sand, remembering to eat, taking time to talk with her friends about things that have nothing to do with activism. Some of these might seem obvious, but for those immersed in the work, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nAs one reader commented on the story, young activists should temper their expectations for immediate results \u201cand put their personal health first in order to reduce their toxic levels of stress.\u201d\n\nBecause, he added, \u201cstress can kill; emotionally and spiritually, as well as physically.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "social", "yates", "black", "work", "movement", "lives", "taking", "casualties", "quiet", "times", "garner", "things", "sign", "ms"], "polarity": 0.027650363820576594, "subjectivity": 0.3347075619416045},

The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim! When a POC is the victim they are treated far worse than this \u201cgodly boy\u201d whom we are lucky didn\u2019t kill more people with his bombs. Imagine if he was Muslim. \u2014 Tyrone Dockery When it\u2019s a white kid, we are quick to throw out the \u201cmisguided\u201d or \u201cseverely disturbed\u201d or whatever linkage to their mental state \u2014 TBunkNasty Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.\u201d He was African-American.\n\nWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New York\n\nCarolyn Ryan, Assistant Managing Editor: We have aggressively pushed to recruit more people of color, and last year, more than a third of our newsroom hires were people of color, and 60 percent were women. We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out? Open your eyes. \u2014 Hannah Drake\n\nHanna Ingber, Reader Center\u2019s Editorial Director: Thank you for your comment. I see how it came across that way and do understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nWe invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.\n\nAdditional Reader Points\n\nIn responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward. Here is a selection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s almost nonexistent for news media to use flattering images of people of color in crime reporting, even if that person is innocent or the victim. \u2014 R. A. Rodriguez\n\nThe coverage is ABSOLUTELY different for White Christian attackers. Had the Austin terrorist been Muslim, there would have been national hysteria. It\u2019s a double standard and must be called out every time. \u2014 Hesham Hassaballa, Chicago\n\nTrayvon Martin was murdered by an over-excited wannabe security guard because he was black and walking through the neighborhood, but somehow the NYT had to tell us all that he\u2019d had trouble at school for pot. The photos of him that were posted weren\u2019t the smiling, friendly sort, like the one posted of Mark Conditt, but was of him in a hoodie, trying to look tough. \u2014 Laura Kenney, Traverse City, Mich.\n\nYou literally have harder hitting profiles of black murder victims than of white Christian serial killers. \u2014 Dylan Brady, Eugene, Ore.\n\nI often see coverage of violent criminals who are Muslim include reactions from the leader or members of their religious community. It is not often asked of Christian faith leaders how the sins of their congregant reflect on the congregation or Christians at large. \u2014 Angelo M. Pinto, Audubon, N.J.\n\nWhenever any sort of mass murder is perpetuated by someone from the \u201cother\u201d category, the entire community is dragged onto the public forum with only one expectation \u2014 own it and repent.\u2014 Nish Patel, Boston", "keywords": ["austin", "used", "continue", "national", "muslim", "coverage", "bomber", "victims", "explained", "conditt", "readers", "main", "victim", "terrorist"], "polarity": 0.08031838551773898, "subjectivity": 0.4224687465312465},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/charleston-international-african-american-museum.html", "text": "Right here. The spot used to be Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. Historians estimate nearly half of all African slaves brought to America arrived in Charleston, most of them at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. At 840-feet-long, it was, two centuries ago, the largest wharf in America. Thousands of Africans waited in the wharf\u2019s warehouses to be auctioned off.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn what has become a parking lot, just inland, 700 of them froze to death.\n\nFor millions of African-Americans today, the site is \u201cground zero,\u201d as the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has put it, for \u201cblackness, black culture, the African experience, the African-American experience, slavery \u2014 however you want to slice it.\u201d\n\nEvery era erects, removes, amends \u2014 or ignores \u2014 monuments. Monuments and historical museums are always mirrors, advertisements, time bombs. Hardly a street or building in Germany today lacks some sign or plaque, redressing the past. It was the proposed removal of a Jim Crow-era statue of Robert E. Lee that became the excuse for the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, where a white nationalist is to go on trial late this year in the murder of a protester at the event.\n\nUnlike Virginia, South Carolina hasn\u2019t taken down Confederate monuments. Much has changed here but much has not. The state\u2019s most recent proposal for social studies standards in public schools doesn\u2019t mention the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks.\n\nThe Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a young white man massacred nine black congregants in 2015 is virtually in the shadow of what\u2019s still the city\u2019s tallest monument (another Jim Crow relic) of the antebellum vice president and proud white supremacist John C. Calhoun.\n\nIt has been nearly two decades since Joseph P. Riley Jr., Charleston\u2019s mayor at the time, floated the idea of a museum of African-American culture and history, on a different site, nearby. A dozen years passed, then more.\n\nMr. Riley retired in 2016, after 40 years in office, having been elected during the 1970s as a racial bridge builder. White racists called him \u201cL\u2019il Black Joe\u201d when he appointed a black police chief in 1975. Charleston prospered over the intervening decades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut gentrification had its effects. Two-thirds black in the early 1980s, the population has become 70 percent white. I suggested to Mr. Riley the other day that Charleston can come across to a visitor as Disneyland for the Confederacy, still enthralled by its era of slavery, with a monument on seemingly every downtown corner commemorating some Confederate soldier, plantation aristocrat or antebellum judge who opposed Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe worked hard while I was mayor to avoid alienation, to make this a city where everyone feels welcome. When I was in school, they didn\u2019t teach us about slavery. I really only learned the truth about how slaves were treated when I had already been in office for many years. That\u2019s when I began to think seriously about the museum.\u201d\n\nBut without enough money or much public enthusiasm, the plan sputtered. Then excavations turned up traces of Gadsden\u2019s Wharf in the muck beneath the grassy lot. Through the exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum, Mr. Riley reached out to Mr. Cobb.\n\nPretty much the architect\u2019s first question: Why not build on the location of the wharf?\n\nBy that point, the city had sold the property to a local restaurateur, unaware of its history. Mr. Riley spent a tidy sum buying the land back.\n\n\u201cSometimes you quick-cook something, it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d rationalized the former mayor, who has taken to calling the museum his \u201cmost important work,\u201d especially after the church murders. \u201cIt turned out to be good that we had a lengthy germination period.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Working here with the structural engineer Guy Nordenson, he describes this project as an \u201cunrhetorical work of architecture.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite true. On the edge of the cobblestoned tourist area, with its ornate Gothic Revival-style churches and Queen Anne houses, the museum\u2019s plain-spoken modernism comes across as almost whisperingly defiant, a turning of the page, promising a deliverance from history, modernism\u2019s originating goal.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoody Nolan are the architects of record. Slender brick cladding underscores the pavilion\u2019s long horizontal spans and extended cantilevers on either end. Pointed columns are meant to make the structure\u2019s mass appear to float. Perching the museum on piers will take account of rising waters. But it\u2019s also hard not to see an allusion to a wharf.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside, galleries will document the many diverse cultures Africans brought to America, and a family center will let visitors trace their roots to Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Hood has reimagined a constrained and narrow property, about a football-field long. The late, great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer was an inspiration. Mr. Hood creates a shaded public plaza, in the breezy space underneath the raised structure, where people may congregate around the building\u2019s double-sided staircase, so the museum can become a gathering spot, not just a pilgrimage site.\n\nThe memorial garden and tidal pool, at the same time, insure that it\u2019s recognized as hallowed ground, a place for contemplation.\n\nThe budget for building the museum is $75 million. The goal is for bulldozers to start digging later this year and for construction to finish in 2020. But there\u2019s a hitch. No shovel will be lifted until all the money is raised. Charleston has committed its $25 million share, along with the land, and private donations are approaching the $25 million goal.\n\nBut the South Carolina legislature, after an understanding that it would contribute $25 million over five years, allocated $14 million, and now won\u2019t promise the remaining $11 million. The clock is ticking. The current legislature remains in session only until the end of May.\n\nState Representative Brian White, a Republican who heads South Carolina\u2019s House Ways and Means Committee, is one of those holding the money back. The museum \u201cis not a state project and we have a lot of state needs right now that far outweigh a municipality\u2019s request,\u201d he recently told the Greenville News, citing competing priorities like education.\n\nBobby Hitt, South Carolina\u2019s commerce secretary, by contrast, has pointed out that the museum will help attract businesses to the state. It adds a work of architectural dignity. And as for educational value, plainly it fills a gap.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t a black project,\u201d as Bakari Sellers, a former Democrat in the state legislature, put it to the Greenville News. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a Charleston project. This is an American project.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOr as James Baldwin said, \u201cIf you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne recent morning I toured the site with Mr. Hood and Michael Boulware Moore, the museum\u2019s president, then we looked out over the harbor. Mr. Moore said his ancestors were among the slaves who arrived in shackles at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nHis great-great grandfather was Robert Smalls, who commandeered a Confederate ship, turning it over to Union forces and winning freedom for himself, his family and his crew. Smalls became a crusading state legislator and United States congressman during Reconstruction. He brought free public education to South Carolina.\n\nA plaque honoring Smalls was installed on a squat little pillar downtown not long ago. Mr. Moore showed me a picture of it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThink, the Stonehenge set from \u201cSpinal Tap.\u201d The memorial looks tiny, and is periodically obscured by bushes.\n\nNot far away, a big statue on a huge round pedestal, at the tip of the battery facing Fort Sumter, honors the Confederate Defenders of Charleston.\n\nSymbols matter.

But the idea that secularism means the separation of church and state \u201cis an old idea\u201d that has been challenged by scholars for about the last 20 years, she said.\n\nThese scholars now argue that the condition of secularism is in fact one in which the state has become \u201cmore and more involved in the regulation of religious life and religious institutions,\u201d she said.\n\nThus, when Islamic movements struggle to make the state their means to Islamicize society, they\u2019re in line with this modern conception of secularism, Professor Mahmood maintained.\n\n\u201cEven in America, Protestantism is a very crucial aspect that informs almost all laws and practices,\u201d she said.\n\nHer work has been translated into Arabic, French, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and Polish.\n\nSaba Mahmood was born on Feb. 3, 1961, in Quetta, Pakistan, to Mahmood Hussein, a policeman, and Latif Begum, a homemaker.\n\nMs. Mahmood moved to the United States in 1981 to study architecture and urban planning at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Samuel Cohen, 74, who was at the march with his wife, L\u00e9a, 70, was one of several who carried a sign that read, \u201cIn France, we kill grandmothers because they\u2019re Jewish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a little exaggerated to say that we are not safe in France today,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cYet it\u2019s true that we are worried, that it\u2019s become hard to practice one\u2019s faith in some areas, and that we\u2019ve reached a new degree of anti-Semitism with this murder.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials attended the march, as did representatives of France\u2019s main political parties, including the head of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen. She has been trying to shed her party\u2019s racist and anti-Semitic past, but was booed at the march.\n\nIn 2015, she kicked Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2014 her father, and a founder of the National Front \u2014 out of the party for reiterating comments he had made previously that dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail of World War II history.\u201d\n\nThe Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, one of the largest Jewish advocacy groups here, known by its French initials C.R.I.F., said ahead of the march that neither the far-left nor the far-right was welcome to join, arguing that anti-Semites were \u201coverrepresented\u201d on both extremes of the political spectrum.\n\nBut Daniel Knoll, one of Ms. Knoll\u2019s two sons, said on Wednesday that everyone could come.\n\n\u201cThe C.R.I.F. is playing politics, and I am opening my heart,\u201d Mr. Knoll said on the French news channel BFM TV. \u201cI open my heart to everybody, everyone who has a mother \u2014 which means everybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbearable, today in France, to know that someone can die like this, in such an atrocious way,\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Knoll was stabbed 11 times, and her body was found partly burned after her attackers tried to set her apartment on fire. One suspect was a neighbor who had often been hosted by Ms. Knoll, while the other was a homeless friend of his.\n\nAn official close to the investigation, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said that the friend had told investigators that he had heard Ms. Knoll\u2019s neighbor say \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic during the killing.

Shortly after he was confirmed last year, Mr. Carson tried to reverse an Obama-era program that would make it easier for recipients of housing vouchers to use them in affluent neighborhoods.\n\nThe move was struck down by the courts, and Mr. Carson abandoned the effort.\n\nLast week, Mr. Carson told members of the Senate Banking Committee that he planned to delay another Obama-era rule that would have required local governments to create detailed plans to integrate racially divided neighborhoods.\n\nAnd a provision barring localities from using federal funding to undertake such programs was stealthily inserted into the 2018 spending plan passed last week by Congress.\n\nDespite these moves, Mr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the department was merely \u201clooking to streamline\u201d its enforcement efforts and to focus on new, neglected areas of discrimination.\n\n\u201cThere is no mission shift. We are, in fact, putting more emphasis in sexual harassment\u201d complaints, Mr. Brown wrote in an email. \u201cIn addition, 60 percent of the fair housing complaints we receive are disability related, and the majority of those have to do with service animals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most significant fight over fair housing under Mr. Trump is taking place in Houston, a sprawling metropolis ranked in numerous studies as one of the United States\u2019 most segregated cities, where overt opposition to a housing development based on race and income has drawn the attention of career HUD investigators.\n\nIn January 2017, before Mr. Obama left office, HUD lawyers accused Houston officials of violating fair housing requirements cited in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The city\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, had killed a 233-unit mixed-income, mixed-race housing development slated for an affluent white area known for its high-end shopping and excellent schools.\n\nHUD told the city to undertake specific remedies as a condition of continued funding, including the approval of the development, known as the Fountain View Project, and the adoption of tough new zoning laws.\n\nIn a scathing letter, HUD officials accused Mr. Turner, who is African-American, of succumbing to \u201cracially motivated local opposition,\u201d claiming that he caved to protests by white business owners and residents.\n\nMr. Turner has denied the accusation, arguing that he opposed the development because only 23 apartments were set aside for low-income families. He also objected to the idea of forced integration, putting him in agreement with Mr. Carson.\n\n\u201cI have chosen to stay in the neighborhood where I grew up, and I will not tell children in similar communities they must live somewhere else,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who grew up in an all-black development.\n\nBut he might have had other reasons for opposing the project. In one meeting, Mr. Turner privately admitted that he hoped his position on the project would coax white Republican state legislators to support a bill needed to restructure Houston\u2019s ailing pension system, according to a former federal official who attended the meeting.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe mayor denied that account.\n\n\u201cHe never told anyone he opposed the Fountain View Project to win votes for his pension overhaul,\u201d said Mary Benton, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, few Democrats have done quite so well in negotiating with the Trump administration as Mr. Turner, who began pressing Mr. Carson to release the city from the order shortly after Mr. Carson was confirmed.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, with Mr. Carson\u2019s blessing, began negotiating directly with Mr. Turner and other city officials. She largely excluded the career lawyers who had already begun drafting a tougher order \u2014 one that required the city to pay the Houston Housing Authority, Fountain View\u2019s developer, as much as $14 million if it insisted on blocking the deal, according to an official in Houston.\n\nBut Mr. Turner, who believes the case to be a distraction from his city\u2019s rebuilding effort, prevailed.\n\nThis month, Ms. Far\u00edas signed a new, less stringent agreement that other Houston officials eager to get federal money flowing into hard-hit neighborhoods \u2014 including Representative Al Green, a Democrat and harsh Carson critic \u2014 hailed as a victory.\n\nBut a coalition of local advocacy groups and national organizations are suing to block the disbursement of $5 billion in HUD recovery money unless the city abides by civil rights-era fair housing laws.\n\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, then damn it, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d said John Henneberger, a director of Texas Housers, an advocacy group that filed a lawsuit last week in Federal District Court to enforce the original HUD letter.\n\n\u201cFountain View was kind of the last stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent eight or nine years documenting systematic and pervasive racial discrimination in Houston \u2014 it is an open-and-shut case.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the agreement required the city to \u201cput in place new procedures for the building of affordable housing\u201d and a study on how to increase affordable housing in the city\u2019s Galleria district, where Fountain View was to be built.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are other signs of change within HUD that could make it far less likely that similar cases would ever be pursued.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, according to six current department officials, has told HUD managers that she intends to replace her top subordinate, Timothy Smyth, who played a central role in the Houston case. Bryan Greene, another senior manager, will be reassigned as part of the shake-up, the officials said.\n\nMr. Brown, in an email, said no one had been reassigned yet \u2014 but he added that it was \u201cwell within the assistant secretary\u2019s authority after 120 days to reassign senior-level personnel.\u201d\n\nMorale at the division is sinking. At a meeting this month of HUD regional housing directors in Atlanta, Ms. Far\u00edas \u2014 a former vice chairwoman of the Bexar County, Tex., Republicans and a Trump campaign supporter \u2014 told one of the directors that she preferred older HUD employees because they were more likely to have had experience working for Republican administrations.\n\nEarlier, according to two aides who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, she had told her staff that it was her intention to root out people she viewed as \u201cObama plants.\u201d\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, through a spokesman, denied making those statements.", "keywords": ["according", "hud", "turner", "far\u00edas", "enforcement", "carson", "mr", "ben", "fair", "housing", "city", "officials", "scales"], "polarity": 0.1182145015478349, "subjectivity": 0.44603205436538773},

(Dozens of people died in the 1919 riot in Chicago.)\n\nThe Chicago Commission on Human Rights (formerly the Mayor\u2019s Commission on Race Relations), which was established after the June 1943 Detroit riot, urged newspaper editors to play down the discord, including an August 1947 attack on black veterans in the Fernwood Park neighborhood and a November 1949 riot that broke out in the Englewood district over rumors that African-Americans were looking to buy in the neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThanks to television, the violence burst into full view in July 1951, when a crowd of at least 2,000 and possibly as many as 5,000 whites in the suburb of Cicero attacked an apartment building after one black family had moved into one of its 20 units. Later that decade, schools, playgrounds, parks and beaches became the sites of racial conflict.\n\nAmbitious programs, billed as \u201curban renewal,\u201d in South Side neighborhoods like Hyde Park-Kenwood and Lake Meadows reinforced segregation. Black politicians, like Representative William L. Dawson, the first African-American to be named chairman of a congressional committee, were muted in their opposition to such projects, partly because they were beneficiaries of the patronage of the city\u2019s entrenched Democratic machine.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs deprived cities of vital tax revenues, exacerbating the problems of the poor neighborhoods.\n\nProfessor Hirsch likened the process of ghetto creation and maintenance to the \u201ccontainment\u201d policies that sought to curb communist expansion abroad during the Cold War. He insisted that the urban crises of the 1960s and \u201970s had not been the fault of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs, which some characterized as liberal excesses, but rather had originated in decisions made a generation earlier.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe compounded shortcomings of slum clearance, urban renewal and segregated high-rise public housing resulted not from an unfettered liberalism\u2019s social experimentation during the civil rights era, but, rather, from a conservative reaction more emblematic of the 1950s and the Cold War,\u201d Professor Hirsch wrote in 1997 in a new foreword to the book.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe \u2018second ghetto\u2019 did not just happen.

But it was dropped from the 1960 general census (there was no census in 1965) and relegated in 1970 to a longer list of questions that were asked of a small minority of residents. After 2000, the question was asked only on the American Community Survey, a separate mandatory poll of a fraction of the population that is conducted more frequently than the census.\n\nCritics noted that the citizenship question was added at the last minute \u2014 the deadline for proposing new questions for the 2020 head count is April 1 \u2014 and that it sidestepped the years of vetting undergone by every other question that will be asked. This month, they added, President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign used the addition of a citizenship question in an emailed fund-raising appeal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that adding the question was a \u201creckless decision to suddenly abandon nearly 70 years of practice.\u201d He argued that the move \u201cwill create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would make impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars.\u201d\n\nIn a seven-page announcement released late Monday, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the secretary of commerce, foresaw those concerns, and sought to allay them. Decades of experience with citizenship questions on earlier censuses and other surveys, he stated, indicate that including it on the 2020 form would not deter people from volunteering to be counted. And he noted that other democracies, from Australia to the United Kingdom, routinely ask about citizenship in their head counts without any difficulty.\n\nMr. Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, acknowledged that both outside experts and leaders within the bureau had been opposed to the change. But he said that \u201cneither the Census Bureau nor the concerned stakeholders could document that the response rate would in fact decline materially.\u201d\n\nAnd although the citizenship question was not tested for inclusion on the 2020 form, he said, it is used in the American Community Survey.\n\nKenneth Prewitt, a director of the Census Bureau under President Clinton, dismissed the administration\u2019s rationale that the question is needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly unnecessary,\u201d said Mr. Prewitt, now a professor of public affairs at Columbia University. \u201cThe Voting Rights Act is being administered very well with data from the American Community Survey.

The only full dress rehearsal of the 2020 census, unfolding this month in Providence County, R.I., has been scaled back in some areas. Tens of thousands of forms mailed to local residents this month do not contain the citizenship question.\n\nExperts dismissed Mr. Ross\u2019s statement that the citizenship question did not need further testing, arguing that the census and the American Community Survey differ in almost every aspect, from size to public awareness to whether a response is required. \u201cWhen you do this once every 10 years, for 340 million people, you\u2019ve got to get it right,\u201d said William H. Frey, a University of Michigan demographer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, critics of Mr. Ross\u2019s decision made available a letter sent to Mr. Ross in January from six former directors of the Census Bureau who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The letter stated that they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that adding the citizenship question would \u201cconsiderably increase the risks to the 2020 enumeration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of evidence that even small changes in survey question order, wording and instructions can have significant, and often unexpected, consequences for the rate, quality and truthfulness of response,\u201d said the former directors, who included Mr. Prewitt. \u201cThe effect of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census on data quality and census accuracy, therefore, is completely unknown.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the states suing the Trump administration are run by Democrats, who risk losing representation if the census undercounts people of color.\n\nCarmen Queveda, an undocumented immigrant in Los Angeles, said on Tuesday she was not about to step out of her house to participate in a census that inquires whether she is a citizen.\n\n\u201cI would never answer, because I don\u2019t have papers,\u201d said the 46-year-old native of Guatemala, who is also the mother of a 14-year-old American boy. \u201cObviously, I am afraid.

Hundreds of readers left comments, many expressing worry about the possibility that the results could be misinterpreted or nefariously applied. Here are Dr. Reich\u2019s responses to some of the comments. \u2014 The Editors\n\nUnfortunately, science has always been misused. From slavery, to eugenics, to economic Darwinism, to anti-abortion politics, the latest scientific knowledge has been employed in the service of evil. The idea of forestalling such efforts is valiant but fruitless. Science must continue its pursuit of truth, and scientists, as always, must speak out when their discoveries are exploited for harmful purposes. \u2014 Syfredrick, Providence, R.I.\n\nWe scientists always need to keep in mind our social responsibilities and to think about whether what we are doing has positive or negative effects on our world.\n\nWith respect to today\u2019s study of human variation, I am optimistic \u2014 I believe that it has been socially positive. It is making every racist view of the world untenable. In my just-published book, I explain how the ancient DNA revolution \u2014 which has provided far greater power to reveal what happened in our deep past than what was available before \u2014 has done far more to undermine racist beliefs than to support them. As I wrote in the final paragraph of my book:\n\nThe study of human variation has not always been a force for good. In Nazi Germany, someone with my expertise at interpreting genetic data would have been tasked with categorizing people by ancestry had that been possible with the science of the 1930s. But in our time, the findings from ancient DNA leave little solace for racist or nationalistic misinterpretation. In this field, the pursuit of truth for its own sake has overwhelmingly had the effect of exploding stereotypes, undercutting prejudice, and highlighting the connections among peoples not previously known to be related. I am optimistic that the direction of my work and that of my colleagues is to promote understanding, and I welcome our opportunity to do our best by the people, ancient and modern, whom we have been given the privilege to study.\n\nMy book also gives concrete examples of how it is no longer so easy to twist science to support long-cherished stereotypes because ancient DNA is now debunking the stories that used to be made up about the nature of human variation. As I wrote there:\n\nThe Nazi ideology of a \u201cpure\u201d Indo-European-speaking Aryan race with deep roots in Germany, traceable through artifacts of the Corded Ware culture, has been shattered by the finding that the people who used these artifacts came from a mass migration from the Russian steppe, a place that German nationalists would have despised as a source. The Hindutva ideology that there was no major contribution to Indian culture from migrants from outside South Asia is undermined by the fact that approximately half of the ancestry of Indians today is derived from multiple waves of mass migration from Iran and the Eurasian steppe within the last five thousand years. Similarly, the idea that the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi have ancestry from West Eurasian farmers that Hutus do not \u2014 an idea that has been incorporated into arguments for genocide \u2014 is nonsense. We now know that nearly every group living today is the product of repeated population mixtures that have occurred over thousands and tens of thousands of years. Mixing is in human nature, and no one population is \u2014 or could be \u2014 pure.\n\nHaving been immersed in the ancient DNA revolution for the past 10 years, I am confident that anyone who pays attention to what it is finding cannot come away feeling affirmed in racist beliefs. My childhood guesses about who we are and how we\u2019re related to one another \u2014 and about the nature of differences among people \u2014 have been shown to be wrong again and again.", "keywords": ["dna", "variation", "genetics", "idea", "opinion", "race", "human", "nature", "racist", "wrote", "science", "talk", "ancestry", "ancient"], "polarity": 0.11693773993302296, "subjectivity": 0.46492281303602045},

The word has a quaint ring today \u2014 like \u2018gramophone\u2019 or \u2018nylons.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow we seem to have entered a phase of trepidation, or even passive segregation. Race is on everybody\u2019s mind, but are there enough efforts to create intimate bonds across racial lines? Jacoby emphasizes that there are two kinds of integration, objective and subjective. The former is about putting people of different races in the same classroom, office and neighborhood. The latter is about emotional bonds of connection, combining a positive sense of pride in group with an overall sense that we are a \u201cwe.\u201d", "keywords": ["racial", "jacoby", "bonds", "opinion", "different", "phrase", "integrated", "sense", "forever", "schools", "integration", "everybodys"], "polarity": 0.06818181818181818, "subjectivity": 0.36783176593521416},

The description, which has been used to dehumanize black people, set off protests at South African stores that left mannequins toppled and racks overturned.\n\nIn the aftermath, H&M chose a lawyer and company insider, Annie Wu, to lead a new four-person team at its Stockholm headquarters focused on global diversity and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cWe want to be held accountable,\u201d she said this week in her first interview since taking the job.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t recognize that in this now new age of transparency,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat the brand stands for is super important to people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLost in Translation\n\nFast fashion companies, which specialize in low-priced, quickly produced clothing and have grown faster than the apparel industry as a whole for years, are under pressure to be more prolific and provocative as they sell across more borders.\n\nH&M, which added 479 stores last year, now has more than 4,000 stores in dozens of countries. Inditex, the enormous parent company behind Zara, has more than 7,500 stores in 94 countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZara outsources a small fraction of its designs \u2014 just 2 percent of the 20,000 designs it produces each year \u2014 and all are sent through multiple reviews before being offered for sale. But some of the outsourced designs have proved problematic.\n\nWhen fashion is contracted out, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot less control, a lot less oversight and involvement from the company along every step of the process,\u201d said Felipe Caro, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has spent years studying Zara.\n\nLast year, critics complained that images of frogs on a Zara skirt resembled a cartoon character called Pepe, which was designated a hate symbol of the alt-right by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe skirt was designed by an independent Spanish artist, Mario de Santiago, who is based in London. In a statement at the time, he said that the frogs had \u201cno connection at all with anything related to hate, violence or discrimination.\u201d\n\nRicardo Cavolo, another artist who designed for the same collection, said in an email that the design process \u201cwas pretty fast.\u201d He spent two days at Zara\u2019s headquarters in Spain, creating paintings on denim that the company then reproduced without making any suggestions or changes, he said.\n\nSupply chain experts urge more careful, decentralized vetting procedures that send designs through a central checkpoint at headquarters and also past gatekeepers in the country of sale.\n\nSoon after shifting into her new role at H&M, Ms. Wu said, she visited South Africa, where the importance of soliciting local input quickly became clear.\n\n\u201cI thought I was very culturally aware,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in New York and speaks Mandarin. \u201cI learned so much more just by being in that office.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Homogeneous Work Force\n\nA few months ago, during a long day spent styling and photographing products for H&M\u2019s website, no one on the Stockholm set appeared to raise concerns about one more item to process, the hoodie with the offensive message, according to a person familiar with the shoot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics said the garment might have been flagged if H&M\u2019s team was more diverse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to avoid this kind of controversy,\u201d said Angel Sinclair, the founder of the advocacy group Models of Diversity. \u201cIf you care about being culturally sensitive, just be more culturally inclusive of talent and managers in the business.\u201d\n\nH&M has more than 100,000 workers worldwide. But the fashion giant\u2019s board is entirely white. And retail experts said that much of the creative process takes place in and around its European home office, far from many of its markets.\n\nMs. Wu, who reports directly to H&M\u2019s chief executive, Karl-Johan Persson, said she did not know the ethnic or racial backgrounds of the employees and contractors involved with the monkey hoodie. But an internal investigation of the incident \u2014 which she declined to discuss in detail \u2014 showed \u201chow important awareness-raising is generally,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of steps of getting a product to market \u2014 it\u2019s never one point in time where we can say, \u2018It\u2019s your fault,\u2019 because there are teams at work on things, there are approval processes throughout,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to pinpoint when.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Need for Speed\n\nH&M and Zara used to stun the industry with their ability to move garments from design to store floor within weeks, when other retailers required more than half a year. But some brands can now perform the same feat much faster, while others, like Amazon and Adidas, are experimenting with on-demand manufacturing.\n\nASOS, an online fashion retailer, adds 4,500 new products to its website each week, according to a recent report from the Fung Global Retail & Technology research firm.\n\nH&M, which has suffered a string of gloomy earnings reports and said this week that it is sitting on $4.3 billion in unsold goods, plans to invest in its supply chain to make it \u201cfaster, more flexible and more responsive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is a low-tech, low-profit, low-growth industry that is being turned upside down,\u201d said John S. Thorbeck, an expert on retail supply chains. \u201cEach of these companies would rather get something as rapidly to market as possible and retract a mistake.\u201d\n\nPrioritizing speed means fewer checks and balances, said Adheer Bahulkar, a retail expert at the consulting firm A.

In 2016, it hired a committee of diversity officers. Diversity and inclusion training has become mandatory for all new employees.\n\nAt H&M, Ms. Wu said she was organizing workshops to help employees recognize unconscious bias and was also reaching out to anti-racism groups and other organizations.

If you go to Dubai and win the Dubai World Cup, you make $6 million less the fees, so it ends up about $4.8 million.\n\n\u201cYou are weighing these things, and we knew we had a horse who had already shown he was a world-class athlete. Everything was basically right with him, he just needed some time off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBalancing business with horsemanship, it was determined California Chrome, who had some bone bruising, would go to Taylor Made to rest and ideally race as a 5-year-old. It proved to be the smart, and sporting, decision.\n\n[READ MORE: The Dubai World Cup, a Story of Horses and Money]\n\nCalifornia Chrome romped to an almost four-length victory in Dubai the following March, and his win was ultimately named the Moment of the Year by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\nHis triumph, which included drama as his saddle slipped, was part of another championship season that culminated in him once again being named Horse of the Year.\n\nComing back as an older horse proved California Chrome\u2019s 2014 Triple Crown run was not a fluke, which made him more commercial as a stallion, and it meant his popularity with the general public continued to grow.\n\nRetired and standing for $40,000, California Chrome \u2014 whose name is a result of the fact he was born in California and has significant white, or chrome, markings \u2014 was bred to 145 mares in the Northern Hemisphere last year. A mare\u2019s gestation period is about 11 months, and the first foals sired by California Chrome are being born this spring.\n\n\u201cWith California Chrome, there is a real pedigree pattern that is very similar to what Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew had,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTo have that kind of breeding further back in his pedigree, that\u2019s how you get a great horse like that. Seattle Slew had the same kind of breeding, and he ended up becoming a good stallion.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor Made is all in on promoting its star, whether California Chrome succeeds as a stallion will be determined in the years to come, as his first runners will not hit the track until 2020. A stallion\u2019s fee is initially determined by his own accomplishments and pedigree, then later by how his foals sell, and ultimately, by how his progeny run.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first two stages are largely speculative, and while the last one is not, it takes years to determine. For example, the most expensive stallion in North America is Tapit, who has wildly outperformed expectations. He first stood for $15,000 before dropping to $12,500 because his popularity waned. When his runners hit the track though, he became the leading sire in the country and now he commands $300,000. Tapit is also an exception to the rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe number of stallions that actually make it are probably 1 out of 15, and there might be 3 out of 15 that look like they are going to make it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is a very emotional business. It changes easily, and it is all about having the momentum at the right time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Made is aware that California Chrome\u2019s fans are still invested in his story, and it is part of an initiative called Horse Country, a nonprofit started in Kentucky by farms, equine medical clinics, and other equine attractions looking to offer experiences to the public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Today, visits with California Chrome and American Pharoah, who is at Ashford Stud, are two of the most common requests.\n\nAccording to Horse Country officials, more than 8,600 fans have come to Taylor Made, and most are there to see California Chrome. This led to the creation of another tour called The California Chrome Experience, which guarantees meeting both the horse and some of his first foals. It is almost sold out.\n\n\u201cI think people were so compelled by California Chrome because of his underdog story and his longevity,\u201d said Anne Hardy, the executive director of Horse Country. \u201cHe was on the track longer than we typically see champions racing now. People love a special way to connect authentically, and that the Taylors would be so open to welcoming guests in so close is exceptional.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors want to help the sport grow, and California Chrome\u2019s popularity is a way to get people to the farm to see behind the scenes. With that in mind, they also partnered with adventure magazine True.Ink to offer fans a chance to vote on a broodmare to be covered by California Chrome with an opportunity to buy into the resulting foal.\n\nAccording to True.Ink, more than 600 people joined the project, which is called The People\u2019s Horse, in an effort to breed the world\u2019s first crowdfunded racehorse. The chosen mare, Colerful Bride, will deliver in April.\n\n\u201cHorse racing for the most part in America is boiled down to brief moments,\u201d said True.Ink\u2019s founder Geoffrey Gray. \u201cThere is the Kentucky Derby and mint juleps and celebrities, and then the year turns. But there is so much more to a horse\u2019s life, and there is more to the experience.\n\n\u201cNot only is this project a way to get people involved in horse racing, but it is another way to be part of California Chrome\u2019s legacy.

{"title": "\n                    \u2018He Is Not a Victim\u2019: Our Austin Bomber Coverage Explained                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/reader-center/austin-bomber-media-coverage.html", "text": "In the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people, law enforcement officials called Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook terrorists. The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim! When a POC is the victim they are treated far worse than this \u201cgodly boy\u201d whom we are lucky didn\u2019t kill more people with his bombs. Imagine if he was Muslim. \u2014 Tyrone Dockery When it\u2019s a white kid, we are quick to throw out the \u201cmisguided\u201d or \u201cseverely disturbed\u201d or whatever linkage to their mental state \u2014 TBunkNasty Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.\u201d He was African-American.\n\nWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias?

We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out?

The research was based on data about virtually all Americans now in their late 30s.\n\nThis first animated chart illustrates one of the study\u2019s main findings: White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way, while black boys raised in similarly wealthy households are more likely to fall to the bottom than stay at the top in their own adult households.\n\nBlack and white boys raised in wealthy families\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nIn the days since that article was published, we\u2019ve heard from many readers eager to know more \u2013 about women, about other racial groups and about the differences between individual income and household income. The charts below make several such comparisons, and at the bottom of this page, we\u2019ve created a tool that lets you make these animations for virtually any combination of race, gender, income type and household income level. If you\u2019re an American born between 1978 and 1983, you are most likely reflected in this data (most of us at The Times who worked on this project are, too).\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by individual income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack and white women raised in families with comparable incomes earn more similar amounts as individuals in adulthood. Previous research has suggested that black women may work longer hours than white women to compensate for the fact that they\u2019re more likely to be the sole earner in a family. But \u2014 contrary to that idea \u2014 this data found that black and white women from similar backgrounds in this age group worked a similar number of hours per week, and made about the same amount of money per hour. They also had similar occupations.\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack women\u2019s economic prospects are still different from white women\u2019s, however. As individuals, black and white women who start from the same place have comparable incomes. But white women are significantly more likely to marry than black women are, and that means they\u2019re also more likely to have a second income at home. The household incomes of white women, as a result, are higher on average.\n\nAsian-American and white children raised in middle-class families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Asian-Americans and whites are likelier to move up the income ladder than down it. One reason Asian-Americans appear to have higher upward mobility rates than whites is that the children of Asian immigrants do particularly well in this data. If we look only at children whose mothers were born in the United States, Asian-Americans and whites fare about equally well.\n\nBlack and Hispanic children from all income groups, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Hispanic and black Americans grow up to earn less than whites raised at the same income level. But Hispanics are on track to close that gap in several generations if mobility stays the same, while blacks are not. (The data included Americans born in the United States and authorized immigrants.)\n\nWhite boys and white girls from all income groups\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nAnother way to think about this data is that white men earn more than almost anyone else. They earn more than black men and they earn more than white women. Both gender and race contribute to inequality, and white men hold advantages in both ways. In this chart, which compares individual incomes, they fare better than white women, in part because men were about 10 percentage points more likely than women to be employed.\n\nCreate Your Own Mobility Animations\n\nPick any two demographic groups.

A recent study led by the economist Daniel Benjamin compiled information on the number of years of education from more than 400,000 people, almost all of whom were of European ancestry. After controlling for differences in socioeconomic background, he and his colleagues identified 74 genetic variations that are over-represented in genes known to be important in neurological development, each of which is incontrovertibly more common in Europeans with more years of education than in Europeans with fewer years of education.\n\nIt is not yet clear how these genetic variations operate. A follow-up study of Icelanders led by the geneticist Augustine Kong showed that these genetic variations also nudge people who carry them to delay having children. So these variations may be explaining longer times at school by affecting a behavior that has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\nThis study has been joined by others finding genetic predictors of behavior. One of these, led by the geneticist Danielle Posthuma, studied more than 70,000 people and found genetic variations in more than 20 genes that were predictive of performance on intelligence tests.\n\nIs performance on an intelligence test or the number of years of school a person attends shaped by the way a person is brought up? Of course. But does it measure something having to do with some aspect of behavior or cognition? Almost certainly. And since all traits influenced by genetics are expected to differ across populations (because the frequencies of genetic variations are rarely exactly the same across populations), the genetic influences on behavior and cognition will differ across populations, too.\n\nYou will sometimes hear that any biological differences among populations are likely to be small, because humans have diverged too recently from common ancestors for substantial differences to have arisen under the pressure of natural selection. This is not true. The ancestors of East Asians, Europeans, West Africans and Australians were, until recently, almost completely isolated from one another for 40,000 years or longer, which is more than sufficient time for the forces of evolution to work. Indeed, the study led by Dr. Kong showed that in Iceland, there has been measurable genetic selection against the genetic variations that predict more years of education in that population just within the last century.\n\nTo understand why it is so dangerous for geneticists and anthropologists to simply repeat the old consensus about human population differences, consider what kinds of voices are filling the void that our silence is creating. Nicholas Wade, a longtime science journalist for The New York Times, rightly notes in his 2014 book, \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History,\u201d that modern research is challenging our thinking about the nature of human population differences. But he goes on to make the unfounded and irresponsible claim that this research is suggesting that genetic factors explain traditional stereotypes.\n\nOne of Mr. Wade\u2019s key sources, for example, is the anthropologist Henry Harpending, who has asserted that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry have no propensity to work when they don\u2019t have to because, he claims, they did not go through the type of natural selection for hard work in the last thousands of years that some Eurasians did. There is simply no scientific evidence to support this statement. Indeed, as 139 geneticists (including myself) pointed out in a letter to The New York Times about Mr. Wade\u2019s book, there is no genetic evidence to back up any of the racist stereotypes he promotes.", "keywords": ["study", "populations", "genetics", "genetic", "behavior", "work", "opinion", "race", "variations", "times", "selection", "differences", "changing", "understanding", "led"], "polarity": 0.09331955922865015, "subjectivity": 0.4207693821330185},

From slavery, to eugenics, to economic Darwinism, to anti-abortion politics, the latest scientific knowledge has been employed in the service of evil. The idea of forestalling such efforts is valiant but fruitless. Science must continue its pursuit of truth, and scientists, as always, must speak out when their discoveries are exploited for harmful purposes. \u2014 Syfredrick, Providence, R.I.\n\nWe scientists always need to keep in mind our social responsibilities and to think about whether what we are doing has positive or negative effects on our world.\n\nWith respect to today\u2019s study of human variation, I am optimistic \u2014 I believe that it has been socially positive. It is making every racist view of the world untenable. In my just-published book, I explain how the ancient DNA revolution \u2014 which has provided far greater power to reveal what happened in our deep past than what was available before \u2014 has done far more to undermine racist beliefs than to support them. As I wrote in the final paragraph of my book:\n\nThe study of human variation has not always been a force for good. In Nazi Germany, someone with my expertise at interpreting genetic data would have been tasked with categorizing people by ancestry had that been possible with the science of the 1930s. But in our time, the findings from ancient DNA leave little solace for racist or nationalistic misinterpretation. In this field, the pursuit of truth for its own sake has overwhelmingly had the effect of exploding stereotypes, undercutting prejudice, and highlighting the connections among peoples not previously known to be related. I am optimistic that the direction of my work and that of my colleagues is to promote understanding, and I welcome our opportunity to do our best by the people, ancient and modern, whom we have been given the privilege to study.\n\nMy book also gives concrete examples of how it is no longer so easy to twist science to support long-cherished stereotypes because ancient DNA is now debunking the stories that used to be made up about the nature of human variation. As I wrote there:\n\nThe Nazi ideology of a \u201cpure\u201d Indo-European-speaking Aryan race with deep roots in Germany, traceable through artifacts of the Corded Ware culture, has been shattered by the finding that the people who used these artifacts came from a mass migration from the Russian steppe, a place that German nationalists would have despised as a source. The Hindutva ideology that there was no major contribution to Indian culture from migrants from outside South Asia is undermined by the fact that approximately half of the ancestry of Indians today is derived from multiple waves of mass migration from Iran and the Eurasian steppe within the last five thousand years. Similarly, the idea that the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi have ancestry from West Eurasian farmers that Hutus do not \u2014 an idea that has been incorporated into arguments for genocide \u2014 is nonsense. We now know that nearly every group living today is the product of repeated population mixtures that have occurred over thousands and tens of thousands of years. Mixing is in human nature, and no one population is \u2014 or could be \u2014 pure.\n\nHaving been immersed in the ancient DNA revolution for the past 10 years, I am confident that anyone who pays attention to what it is finding cannot come away feeling affirmed in racist beliefs. My childhood guesses about who we are and how we\u2019re related to one another \u2014 and about the nature of differences among people \u2014 have been shown to be wrong again and again.", "keywords": ["dna", "variation", "genetics", "idea", "opinion", "race", "human", "nature", "racist", "wrote", "science", "talk", "ancestry", "ancient"], "polarity": 0.11693773993302296, "subjectivity": 0.46492281303602045},

It proved to be the smart, and sporting, decision.\n\n[READ MORE: The Dubai World Cup, a Story of Horses and Money]\n\nCalifornia Chrome romped to an almost four-length victory in Dubai the following March, and his win was ultimately named the Moment of the Year by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\nHis triumph, which included drama as his saddle slipped, was part of another championship season that culminated in him once again being named Horse of the Year.\n\nComing back as an older horse proved California Chrome\u2019s 2014 Triple Crown run was not a fluke, which made him more commercial as a stallion, and it meant his popularity with the general public continued to grow.\n\nRetired and standing for $40,000, California Chrome \u2014 whose name is a result of the fact he was born in California and has significant white, or chrome, markings \u2014 was bred to 145 mares in the Northern Hemisphere last year. A mare\u2019s gestation period is about 11 months, and the first foals sired by California Chrome are being born this spring.\n\n\u201cWith California Chrome, there is a real pedigree pattern that is very similar to what Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew had,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTo have that kind of breeding further back in his pedigree, that\u2019s how you get a great horse like that. Seattle Slew had the same kind of breeding, and he ended up becoming a good stallion.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor Made is all in on promoting its star, whether California Chrome succeeds as a stallion will be determined in the years to come, as his first runners will not hit the track until 2020. A stallion\u2019s fee is initially determined by his own accomplishments and pedigree, then later by how his foals sell, and ultimately, by how his progeny run.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first two stages are largely speculative, and while the last one is not, it takes years to determine. For example, the most expensive stallion in North America is Tapit, who has wildly outperformed expectations. He first stood for $15,000 before dropping to $12,500 because his popularity waned. When his runners hit the track though, he became the leading sire in the country and now he commands $300,000. Tapit is also an exception to the rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe number of stallions that actually make it are probably 1 out of 15, and there might be 3 out of 15 that look like they are going to make it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is a very emotional business. It changes easily, and it is all about having the momentum at the right time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Made is aware that California Chrome\u2019s fans are still invested in his story, and it is part of an initiative called Horse Country, a nonprofit started in Kentucky by farms, equine medical clinics, and other equine attractions looking to offer experiences to the public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Today, visits with California Chrome and American Pharoah, who is at Ashford Stud, are two of the most common requests.\n\nAccording to Horse Country officials, more than 8,600 fans have come to Taylor Made, and most are there to see California Chrome. This led to the creation of another tour called The California Chrome Experience, which guarantees meeting both the horse and some of his first foals. It is almost sold out.\n\n\u201cI think people were so compelled by California Chrome because of his underdog story and his longevity,\u201d said Anne Hardy, the executive director of Horse Country. \u201cHe was on the track longer than we typically see champions racing now. People love a special way to connect authentically, and that the Taylors would be so open to welcoming guests in so close is exceptional.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors want to help the sport grow, and California Chrome\u2019s popularity is a way to get people to the farm to see behind the scenes. With that in mind, they also partnered with adventure magazine True.Ink to offer fans a chance to vote on a broodmare to be covered by California Chrome with an opportunity to buy into the resulting foal.\n\nAccording to True.Ink, more than 600 people joined the project, which is called The People\u2019s Horse, in an effort to breed the world\u2019s first crowdfunded racehorse. The chosen mare, Colerful Bride, will deliver in April.\n\n\u201cHorse racing for the most part in America is boiled down to brief moments,\u201d said True.Ink\u2019s founder Geoffrey Gray. \u201cThere is the Kentucky Derby and mint juleps and celebrities, and then the year turns. But there is so much more to a horse\u2019s life, and there is more to the experience.\n\n\u201cNot only is this project a way to get people involved in horse racing, but it is another way to be part of California Chrome\u2019s legacy. It is a way to be part of the California Chrome family, only in this version, the family is going to be a lot larger than normal.\u201d", "keywords": ["winner", "foals", "kentucky", "way", "taylor", "california", "chrome", "country", "horse", "dubai", "kids", "racing"], "polarity": 0.20342220910402722, "subjectivity": 0.4297200085268267},
{"title": "\n                    \u2018He Is Not a Victim\u2019: Our Austin Bomber Coverage Explained                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/reader-center/austin-bomber-media-coverage.html", "text": "In the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people, law enforcement officials called Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook terrorists. The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.\n\nBut in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.\n\nUnder the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: The words \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are problematic because there is no universal consensus on what they mean. Thus, the decision to label an attack or attacker \u201cterrorist\u201d is almost always at least partly a political judgment.\n\nContradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.\n\nIt strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.\n\nFor these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.\n\nCalling a Black Child a Man\n\nWhy do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with you that, at the age of 17, Draylen Mason was a child, a teenager, one who had a promising future as a musician, as we noted here. There were two instances in which we referred to him as a man. Both were later updated. I appreciate your raising this issue.\n\nTreatment of White Suspects\n\nHe is not the victim! When a POC is the victim they are treated far worse than this \u201cgodly boy\u201d whom we are lucky didn\u2019t kill more people with his bombs. Imagine if he was Muslim. \u2014 Tyrone Dockery When it\u2019s a white kid, we are quick to throw out the \u201cmisguided\u201d or \u201cseverely disturbed\u201d or whatever linkage to their mental state \u2014 TBunkNasty Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: I agree with readers on this point \u2014 that the only victims in this story are the ones Mark Conditt killed and injured. He is not a victim.\n\nAfter such events, we journalists write profiles of the perpetrators of such attacks as we try to understand their backgrounds and what may have motivated them. Here\u2019s one such piece we did on Omar Mateen and another on Dylann Roof.\n\nWe wrote of Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and wounded seven others in Dallas in 2016: \u201cThere was a time when he was known as a well-mannered young man \u2014 a regular at his church and a pleasant presence on a tree-lined, suburban, multicultural street in a neighborhood called Camelot. He grew up to serve his country in Afghanistan.\u201d He was African-American.\n\nWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.\n\nLanguage Used in a Tweet\n\nWhy did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, Detroit\n\nCynthia Collins, Social Media Editor: As a practice, we use Twitter to highlight new details as they emerge on stories that are continuing to develop.\n\nPeople had been actively seeking updates on the Austin investigation. Our article had just been updated to include interviews with the suspect\u2019s neighbors. We tweeted quotes from one of these interviews to share another element of our emerging profile of the suspect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe continued to provide additional updates over the next few hours to this tweet in an effort to provide more context.\n\nHowever, we quickly heard from disappointed readers who believed we painted an overly sympathetic picture of the suspect in this tweet. I share this belief.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.\n\nTreatment of Muslim Victims and Suspects\n\nThe social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts. However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical. All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, Dublin\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: This too has its echo in the Middle East. We do try our best to delve into the stories, perspectives and contexts of both victims and perpetrators. It\u2019s not always possible, because of access issues. But at the same time, in the media in general there is a dynamic in which the more bombings happen in a place, the more they come to seem routine and not newsworthy, a thing that \u201cjust happens over there\u201d (unless that place is the United States or Europe). This distorts the fact that the vast majority of victims of Islamist extremist violence are Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Do we not count as full humans?\n\nAfter a spate of bombings in mostly Muslim countries around the world, I talked with Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, in Paris. He was leaning wearily over his coffee at a Left Bank cafe, wondering: Where was the global outrage?\n\nWhere was the outpouring that came after the same terrorist groups unleashed horror in Brussels and in Paris? In a supposedly globalized world, do nonwhites, non-Christians and non-Westerners count as fully human?\n\nI believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCovering Black Victims\n\nWhy did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, Washington\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: We published information on the victims in Austin as soon as we gathered it. The correspondents assigned to this story went more than once to the victims\u2019 families to try to tell more complete stories about them.\n\nIn each case, the families were too traumatized, understandably, to let us in. We wrote what we could from the sidelines. We remain committed to pursuing this, because the story of such a loss is never over. Here is one piece on those who died.\n\nDetails of a Suspect\u2019s Life\n\nI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif. I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, Seattle\n\nMarc Lacey, National Editor: With an event of this magnitude, with consequences so horrific, The Times made the decision to give four correspondents in Austin and four others in New York one assignment: Find out anything possible about this perpetrator and help us understand how he could have committed these terrible acts.\n\nWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.\n\nPhoto Selection\n\nI have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, Chicago The photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.\n\nCrista Chapman, National Photo Editor: The photo of the suspect that we published was the only one that was confirmed at the time by the wire services that we subscribe to. We were unable to independently confirm other photos that allegedly showed Mark Conditt holding an assault rifle, including the photo referenced by the reader.\n\nThere were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.\n\nWe did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaff Diversity\n\nWhat is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif. What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New York\n\nCarolyn Ryan, Assistant Managing Editor: We have aggressively pushed to recruit more people of color, and last year, more than a third of our newsroom hires were people of color, and 60 percent were women. We have also introduced changes to our interview and hiring process to make sure we are selecting people from a diverse pool of candidates and using an interview process that has been developed to eliminate bias.\n\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our outreach to underrepresented groups, partnering with organizations dedicated to diversity in technology (e.g. Code2040), journalism (e.g. National Association of Black Journalists) and media (e.g. The Emma Bowen Foundation). And every year, we run a Student Journalism Institute that provides training for diverse groups of college students interested in pursuing a career in journalism.\n\nAnne Barnard, Beirut Bureau Chief: As a foreign correspondent in the Middle East, I see firsthand how important it is that The Times continue to diversify its reporting and editing staff. We need to reflect not only the makeup of our core audience in the United States but also the communities we cover by including more people with the appropriate language skills and cultural literacy.\n\nThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.\n\nWhy Ask These Questions\n\nHonestly to even ask this question [\u201cHow do you see racial and religious bias playing out in news coverage?\u201d] is a farce as if you cannot see the writing on the wall. Black and Muslim people have said this for years. To ask this is like you have not been paying attention. How do we see it play out? Open your eyes. \u2014 Hannah Drake\n\nHanna Ingber, Reader Center\u2019s Editorial Director: Thank you for your comment. I see how it came across that way and do understand where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nWe invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.\n\nAdditional Reader Points\n\nIn responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward. Here is a selection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s almost nonexistent for news media to use flattering images of people of color in crime reporting, even if that person is innocent or the victim. \u2014 R. A. Rodriguez\n\nThe coverage is ABSOLUTELY different for White Christian attackers. Had the Austin terrorist been Muslim, there would have been national hysteria. It\u2019s a double standard and must be called out every time. \u2014 Hesham Hassaballa, Chicago\n\nTrayvon Martin was murdered by an over-excited wannabe security guard because he was black and walking through the neighborhood, but somehow the NYT had to tell us all that he\u2019d had trouble at school for pot. The photos of him that were posted weren\u2019t the smiling, friendly sort, like the one posted of Mark Conditt, but was of him in a hoodie, trying to look tough. \u2014 Laura Kenney, Traverse City, Mich.\n\nYou literally have harder hitting profiles of black murder victims than of white Christian serial killers. \u2014 Dylan Brady, Eugene, Ore.\n\nI often see coverage of violent criminals who are Muslim include reactions from the leader or members of their religious community. It is not often asked of Christian faith leaders how the sins of their congregant reflect on the congregation or Christians at large. \u2014 Angelo M. Pinto, Audubon, N.J.\n\nWhenever any sort of mass murder is perpetuated by someone from the \u201cother\u201d category, the entire community is dragged onto the public forum with only one expectation \u2014 own it and repent.\u2014 Nish Patel, Boston", "keywords": ["austin", "used", "continue", "national", "muslim", "coverage", "bomber", "victims", "explained", "conditt", "readers", "main", "victim", "terrorist"], "polarity": 0.08031838551773898, "subjectivity": 0.4224687465312465},

The research was based on data about virtually all Americans now in their late 30s.\n\nThis first animated chart illustrates one of the study\u2019s main findings: White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way, while black boys raised in similarly wealthy households are more likely to fall to the bottom than stay at the top in their own adult households.\n\nBlack and white boys raised in wealthy families\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nIn the days since that article was published, we\u2019ve heard from many readers eager to know more \u2013 about women, about other racial groups and about the differences between individual income and household income. The charts below make several such comparisons, and at the bottom of this page, we\u2019ve created a tool that lets you make these animations for virtually any combination of race, gender, income type and household income level. If you\u2019re an American born between 1978 and 1983, you are most likely reflected in this data (most of us at The Times who worked on this project are, too).\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by individual income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack and white women raised in families with comparable incomes earn more similar amounts as individuals in adulthood. Previous research has suggested that black women may work longer hours than white women to compensate for the fact that they\u2019re more likely to be the sole earner in a family. But \u2014 contrary to that idea \u2014 this data found that black and white women from similar backgrounds in this age group worked a similar number of hours per week, and made about the same amount of money per hour. They also had similar occupations.\n\nBlack and white girls raised in poor families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBlack women\u2019s economic prospects are still different from white women\u2019s, however. As individuals, black and white women who start from the same place have comparable incomes. But white women are significantly more likely to marry than black women are, and that means they\u2019re also more likely to have a second income at home. The household incomes of white women, as a result, are higher on average.\n\nAsian-American and white children raised in middle-class families, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Asian-Americans and whites are likelier to move up the income ladder than down it. One reason Asian-Americans appear to have higher upward mobility rates than whites is that the children of Asian immigrants do particularly well in this data. If we look only at children whose mothers were born in the United States, Asian-Americans and whites fare about equally well.\n\nBlack and Hispanic children from all income groups, as measured by household income\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nBoth Hispanic and black Americans grow up to earn less than whites raised at the same income level. But Hispanics are on track to close that gap in several generations if mobility stays the same, while blacks are not. (The data included Americans born in the United States and authorized immigrants.)\n\nWhite boys and white girls from all income groups\n\nFollow the lives of these Americans and see where they end up as adults: Replay \u21ba\n\nAnother way to think about this data is that white men earn more than almost anyone else. They earn more than black men and they earn more than white women. Both gender and race contribute to inequality, and white men hold advantages in both ways. In this chart, which compares individual incomes, they fare better than white women, in part because men were about 10 percentage points more likely than women to be employed.\n\nCreate Your Own Mobility Animations\n\nPick any two demographic groups.

A recent study led by the economist Daniel Benjamin compiled information on the number of years of education from more than 400,000 people, almost all of whom were of European ancestry. After controlling for differences in socioeconomic background, he and his colleagues identified 74 genetic variations that are over-represented in genes known to be important in neurological development, each of which is incontrovertibly more common in Europeans with more years of education than in Europeans with fewer years of education.\n\nIt is not yet clear how these genetic variations operate. A follow-up study of Icelanders led by the geneticist Augustine Kong showed that these genetic variations also nudge people who carry them to delay having children. So these variations may be explaining longer times at school by affecting a behavior that has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\nThis study has been joined by others finding genetic predictors of behavior. One of these, led by the geneticist Danielle Posthuma, studied more than 70,000 people and found genetic variations in more than 20 genes that were predictive of performance on intelligence tests.\n\nIs performance on an intelligence test or the number of years of school a person attends shaped by the way a person is brought up? Of course. But does it measure something having to do with some aspect of behavior or cognition? Almost certainly. And since all traits influenced by genetics are expected to differ across populations (because the frequencies of genetic variations are rarely exactly the same across populations), the genetic influences on behavior and cognition will differ across populations, too.\n\nYou will sometimes hear that any biological differences among populations are likely to be small, because humans have diverged too recently from common ancestors for substantial differences to have arisen under the pressure of natural selection. This is not true. The ancestors of East Asians, Europeans, West Africans and Australians were, until recently, almost completely isolated from one another for 40,000 years or longer, which is more than sufficient time for the forces of evolution to work. Indeed, the study led by Dr. Kong showed that in Iceland, there has been measurable genetic selection against the genetic variations that predict more years of education in that population just within the last century.\n\nTo understand why it is so dangerous for geneticists and anthropologists to simply repeat the old consensus about human population differences, consider what kinds of voices are filling the void that our silence is creating. Nicholas Wade, a longtime science journalist for The New York Times, rightly notes in his 2014 book, \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History,\u201d that modern research is challenging our thinking about the nature of human population differences. But he goes on to make the unfounded and irresponsible claim that this research is suggesting that genetic factors explain traditional stereotypes.\n\nOne of Mr. Wade\u2019s key sources, for example, is the anthropologist Henry Harpending, who has asserted that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry have no propensity to work when they don\u2019t have to because, he claims, they did not go through the type of natural selection for hard work in the last thousands of years that some Eurasians did. There is simply no scientific evidence to support this statement. Indeed, as 139 geneticists (including myself) pointed out in a letter to The New York Times about Mr. Wade\u2019s book, there is no genetic evidence to back up any of the racist stereotypes he promotes.", "keywords": ["study", "populations", "genetics", "genetic", "behavior", "work", "opinion", "race", "variations", "times", "selection", "differences", "changing", "understanding", "led"], "polarity": 0.09331955922865015, "subjectivity": 0.4207693821330185}
