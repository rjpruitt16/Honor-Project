Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself. I just wish she wasn\u2019t alone.", "keywords": ["auntie", "administration", "seemingly", "waters", "stand", "know", "afraid", "shes", "maxine", "trump", "fight", "bad", "man", "willing", "trumps", "president"], "polarity": 0.03218294051627384, "subjectivity": 0.5180274971941637},

Thousands of people are killed or their lives are destroyed, their families are destroyed. So you can kill thousands of people and go to jail for 30 days ... And then you wonder why we have a problem. That\u2019s why we have a problem. And I don\u2019t think we should play games. Now, I never did polling on that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s popular. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s unpopular. Probably you\u2019ll have some people who say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not nice.\u201d But these people are killing our kids and they\u2019re killing our families. And we have to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mexicans and gangs:\n\nHow about ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]? These ICE guys are tough as hell. They go in and they are not playing games. You know, the only thing I hate to say, not so politically correct, but the only thing these gang members understand is toughness. I hate to say it. They\u2019re not interested in genius. They\u2019re not interested\u2014they\u2019re interested in somebody who is tougher than them, that\u2019s what, and we have the toughest people you\u2019ve ever seen, and they went out in Long Island and they grabbed them by the neck and they threw them in the paddy. We\u2019re cleaning out. We\u2019re doing it.\n\nTrump also used his time to call Sen.

Sadly, the frat\u2019s January 2017 inauguration probate show at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was poorly attended despite the fact that Chrisette Michele performed at the after-party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike most frat houses, the MAGA house is littered with McDonald\u2019s wrappers, guys who don\u2019t mind forcing themselves on pretty freshmen and a collection of party animals who never worry about studying. But they are highly regarded because their frat parties are epic.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to a Toupee Dawg party at Mar-a-Lago, they are legendary pussy-grabbing-paloozas. People come from as far as China to attend the homecoming bash. I tried to get into one of the toga parties, but they wouldn\u2019t let me in.\n\nAt least I think it was a toga party, because everyone was wearing white sheets ... and white hoods. They were all gathered around this beautiful campfire in the shape of a lowercase \u201ct,\u201d saying something about \u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d which is probably one of their secret fraternity songs. It looked like a lot of fun!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is speculation that the entire fraternity could be kicked off the yard because of an ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller. Allegations of sexual misconduct and fixing chapter elections have swirled around Grand Basileus Donald Trump, who didn\u2019t pledge because he is a legacy.\n\nTrump serves as dean of pledges despite the fact that he is considered \u201cpaper.\u201d He is known as one of the toughest, most unhinged members of the frat, who loves to \u201cbreak out the wood,\u201d according to former pledges, insiders and Stormy Daniels. Some of the other potential members who have already quit:\n\nSean Spicer: He had trouble learning his frat history and referred to the community service camps built by the German chapter as \u201cHolocaust centers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Bannon: He wouldn\u2019t humble himself to his D.P.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci: According to him, \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon; I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\u201d\n\nJames Comey: Comey refused to take the fraternity\u2019s loyalty oath.

When it comes to more serious matters like politics and, specifically, racial politics, the phrase \u201cStop, drop and roll\u201d is an immediate survival guide to sparing your last nerve from a fatal end.

During an interview with Fox Business Network that aired Wednesday, TrumPutin was asked about the Obama administration\u2019s hold over FBI Director James Comey, the New York Daily News reports.\n\n\n\nOf course, TrumPutin found a way to make it all about Clinton because he\u2019s obsessed with her. At this point, TrumPutin is Chris Brown and Clinton is his Karrueche Tran.\n\n\u201cDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton. If he weren\u2019t, she would be going to trial,\u201d TrumPutin said about the FBI director\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s reported use of private emails while handling confidential information.\n\n\n\nTrumPutin clearly misinterpreted Comey\u2019s July testimony before Congress in which he said that the FBI wouldn\u2019t prosecute Clinton or members of her team for the alleged email mishap. \u201cWhen he [Comey] was reading those charges, she was guilty of every one,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin did add that it wasn\u2019t too late for him to remove Comey from his position, but noted that \u201cI have confidence in him.\u201d\n\nThe dictator in chief dismissed whether or not he would pursue charges against Clinton, noting that he only wanted to talk about \u201cpositive things.\u201d\n\nMan, this president is batshit crazy. First off, he brings up Clinton when no one was talking about her; makes all of these false claims, as this administration has been known to do; and then, when he claims that she is guilty of all these charges, he doesn\u2019t want to talk about charging her because that is not \u201cpositive\u201d topics. He\u2019s really good at being a shithead and shifting the conversation so that he can make unsubstantiated claims about a person\u2019s character without repercussion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin is still trying to undo Obamacare because of course he is. At this point, Obamacare is the tattoo on his new girlfriend that reminds him of her ex. It doesn\u2019t even say the ex\u2019s name, but it\u2019s there from a time when they dated, and being the controlling dirtbag that he is, he wants it gone.\n\n\u201cHealth care is going to happen at some point,\u201d Trump said, adding that it had to come before tax reform, the Daily News reports. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first.\u201d\n\nLastly, the president tried to talk about ongoing tensions with Russia and North Korea, but it\u2019s so hard to listen to this guy talk. He\u2019s sounds like a kid trying to answer a homework question when he didn\u2019t read the assigned chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s meeting with Russia\u2019s top diplomat over the country\u2019s continued support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who\u2019s accused of launching a chemical weapon attack last week on his own people, TrumPutin had this to say: \u201cI think it\u2019s very bad for Russia. I think it\u2019s very bad for mankind. If Russia didn\u2019t go in and back this animal, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem right now.\u201d\n\nAnd on North Korea, TrumPutin gave this eloquent soliloquy: \u201cWe are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people. And I will say this: He is doing the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nI. Can\u2019t. With. This.

How does a man whose first true introduction into the American consciousness was a barefaced lie about the crowd size at the president\u2019s inauguration become the surprise guest at this year\u2019s Emmy Awards, only to make a joke about said lie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, he\u2019s white. And I don\u2019t mean that in an everything-comes-up-roses-for-white-men way. ... Naw, scratch that; I do. I don\u2019t know how else to explain the embrace of Sean Spicer\u2019s do-over other than with the fact that he is a white man.\n\nChris Rock once jokingly exclaimed that there was no white man in the audience who would switch places with him, and he\u2019s rich! He then imitated a one-legged white man\u2019s response: \u201cNah, I wanna ride this white thing out\u201d (NSFW).\n\n\n\nBecause whiteness affords Spicer some luxuries that aren\u2019t afforded to other races. He was the communications person and the first line of defense for President Petty von Tweets Too Much, and not only upheld the lies that came from this administration, but admonished the press that tried to get at the truth. Spicer was uninformed-, racist- and xenophobic-adjacent at best, and calculated and divisive at worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN attempts to explain Spicer\u2019s presence in a space where he shouldn\u2019t have been welcomed:\n\nWas Spicer \u201cin on the joke?\u201d Was he essentially admitting to lying to the American people from behind the White House podium? As the debate went on late Sunday night, Colbert was celebrating his first gig hosting the Emmys at a late-night party in Los Angeles. Spicer was there too, taking selfies with celebrities and gawkers. He seemed to revel in the attention. Spicer resigned from his job as White House press secretary in July and formally left the administration in August. Now he is hitting the speaker circuit, landing consulting gigs and looking for a potential TV commentator job. He will be a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics this fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an odd dynamic to see a liberal Hollywood crowd fully embracing this new \u201cfunny\u201d Spicer. Let\u2019s be clear about a few things: Spicer was never funny or even remotely humorous in his position as White House press secretary. He was mean and curt and all forms of an asshole. His position required it, and because it was demanded of him, he was willing to be that person. Now that he\u2019s out of the administration, he\u2019s attempting to reinvent himself as a kinder, gentler version of himself.\n\nBut I\u2019m ashamed at how quickly a reportedly incensed liberal white America is willing to embrace him. I\u2019m ashamed that the Sean Spicer who was reportedly super angry with Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Saturday Night Live impersonation of him now gets to act like none of that ever happened. And the deplorable Spicer gets to be the punch line for the new \u201cfunny\u201d Spicer.\n\nIn the words of the great Ed Lover, I say:", "keywords": ["stage", "facts", "crusade", "sean", "liberal", "white", "lie", "secretary", "funny", "spicer", "house", "hes", "providing", "line", "press", "historys", "spicy"], "polarity": 0.024200693374422187, "subjectivity": 0.4844761171032358},

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["rowes", "justiceforjazzy", "wayshe", "look", "jamaica", "black", "rowe", "white", "kinda", "woman", "south", "jazzy", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

The conversations that began with student groups, faculty, and staff yesterday are going to continue and involve our full community,\u201d Woodward added. \u201cI am dedicated to that mission and will continue to share additional information about opportunities for our path forward in meaningful dialogue and action.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nIn that case, one might wonder why it took so long for the university to take action, since shit hit the fan a full two weeks ago. But at least the ball of justice seems to be rolling now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of justice, Brochu is still facing the relatively weak charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but the New York Times reports that the West Hartford, Conn., Police Department said it would be requesting that Brochu be slapped with a felony charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, which sounds a lot more like it.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA white University of Hartford freshman, who is apparently as nasty and as vindictive as they come, has been arrested after weeks of systematically contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space in an effort to get her to move out, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianna Rae Brochu, 18, was arrested Saturday and is facing charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace after police say she boasted about rubbing used tampons on her black roommate\u2019s bag and contaminating her eating utensils, toothbrush and other beauty products, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nChennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, who is also a freshman at the Connecticut school, said that she had gotten a bad vibe from Brochu from day one.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt unwanted and she was giving off vibes,\u201d Rowe told Fox 61.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 17, when Rowe finally moved out, that she realized her roommate had been systematically attacking her in the nastiest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I was moving out and I simply said \u2018Yup,\u2019 and she made a face and said \u2018OK,\u2019 and then I saw her pick up her phone and automatically start texting,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case, authorities say; Brochu was actually posting to Instagram, boasting that she had gotten rid of \u201cJamaican Barbie\u201d using the nastiest methods possible.\n\n\u201cFinally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it\u2019s colder up here, I\u2019m just probably catching a cold,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThe sore throat pain got worse and it was just throat pain. And this was happening for about a month. It got to the point where I had extreme throat pain where I couldn\u2019t sleep, to the point where I couldn\u2019t speak. Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together,\u201d school President Greg Woodward added in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Beckzilla Brochu, because white womanhood, she is currently free on $1,000 bail and is due back in court Wednesday, according to Heavy. Both of her charges are Class B misdemeanors, meaning that they would carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possibly a fine.\n\nThe Courant notes that Brochu attempted to play the victim, saying that she \u201cbegan to lash out due to a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 caused by [the victim\u2019s] rude behavior, not compromising and posting Snapchat videos of me sleeping and making fun of me snoring.\u201d\n\nSo, because of someone allegedly being rude and posting Snapchat videos of you sleeping, your next level of action and the response that you deem appropriate is rubbing your period blood all over the person\u2019s bag and licking her plate, fork and spoon?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the way, Brochu did confess to licking Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and smearing blood on her backpack, but she denied any other actions she posted about on Instagram, claiming that it \u201cwas a lie in an attempt to \u2018appear funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Beckery.\n\nMeanwhile, social media is rallying behind Rowe, starting the hashtag #JusticeForJazzy and demanding that the University of Hartford stop talking about it and instead just be about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["rubbing", "living", "used", "space", "hartford", "im", "freshman", "tampons", "expelled", "throat", "roommate", "rowe", "black", "white", "school", "university", "roommates", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03695306071339131, "subjectivity": 0.4264346535007693},

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["rowes", "justiceforjazzy", "wayshe", "look", "jamaica", "black", "rowe", "white", "kinda", "woman", "south", "jazzy", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

While at the TPD, she landed a cushy desk job after the killing, as she was not allowed to patrol.

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["rowes", "justiceforjazzy", "wayshe", "look", "jamaica", "black", "rowe", "white", "kinda", "woman", "south", "jazzy", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

After widespread scrutiny and a big social media push, the University of Hartford is finally showing up and showing out, and Brianna Brochu\u2014who is accused of rubbing used tampons and contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space\u2014has been expelled and is considered persona non grata on campus.\n\nUniversity President Greg Woodward released a statement Wednesday afternoon, saying in part:\n\nAs of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford. She will not be returning to the institution. There has been an outpouring of concern for the victim of these acts from across the University and the country. In my meeting with her yesterday, I reiterated my personal commitment to ensuring she has all available personal and academic resources the University can provide.\n\nWoodward reiterated that the university took \u201caction immediately\u201d once the allegations were made known, despite the fact that the victim, Chennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, claimed that the school attempted to sweep the issue under the rug.\n\n\u201cIt is clear there is work to be done at our University to ensure that all students feel safe, respected, and valued. The conversations that began with student groups, faculty, and staff yesterday are going to continue and involve our full community,\u201d Woodward added. \u201cI am dedicated to that mission and will continue to share additional information about opportunities for our path forward in meaningful dialogue and action.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nIn that case, one might wonder why it took so long for the university to take action, since shit hit the fan a full two weeks ago. But at least the ball of justice seems to be rolling now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of justice, Brochu is still facing the relatively weak charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but the New York Times reports that the West Hartford, Conn., Police Department said it would be requesting that Brochu be slapped with a felony charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, which sounds a lot more like it.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA white University of Hartford freshman, who is apparently as nasty and as vindictive as they come, has been arrested after weeks of systematically contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space in an effort to get her to move out, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianna Rae Brochu, 18, was arrested Saturday and is facing charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace after police say she boasted about rubbing used tampons on her black roommate\u2019s bag and contaminating her eating utensils, toothbrush and other beauty products, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nChennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, who is also a freshman at the Connecticut school, said that she had gotten a bad vibe from Brochu from day one.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt unwanted and she was giving off vibes,\u201d Rowe told Fox 61.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 17, when Rowe finally moved out, that she realized her roommate had been systematically attacking her in the nastiest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I was moving out and I simply said \u2018Yup,\u2019 and she made a face and said \u2018OK,\u2019 and then I saw her pick up her phone and automatically start texting,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case, authorities say; Brochu was actually posting to Instagram, boasting that she had gotten rid of \u201cJamaican Barbie\u201d using the nastiest methods possible.\n\n\u201cFinally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it\u2019s colder up here, I\u2019m just probably catching a cold,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThe sore throat pain got worse and it was just throat pain. And this was happening for about a month. It got to the point where I had extreme throat pain where I couldn\u2019t sleep, to the point where I couldn\u2019t speak. Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together,\u201d school President Greg Woodward added in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Beckzilla Brochu, because white womanhood, she is currently free on $1,000 bail and is due back in court Wednesday, according to Heavy. Both of her charges are Class B misdemeanors, meaning that they would carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possibly a fine.\n\nThe Courant notes that Brochu attempted to play the victim, saying that she \u201cbegan to lash out due to a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 caused by [the victim\u2019s] rude behavior, not compromising and posting Snapchat videos of me sleeping and making fun of me snoring.\u201d\n\nSo, because of someone allegedly being rude and posting Snapchat videos of you sleeping, your next level of action and the response that you deem appropriate is rubbing your period blood all over the person\u2019s bag and licking her plate, fork and spoon?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the way, Brochu did confess to licking Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and smearing blood on her backpack, but she denied any other actions she posted about on Instagram, claiming that it \u201cwas a lie in an attempt to \u2018appear funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Beckery.\n\nMeanwhile, social media is rallying behind Rowe, starting the hashtag #JusticeForJazzy and demanding that the University of Hartford stop talking about it and instead just be about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["rubbing", "living", "used", "space", "hartford", "im", "freshman", "tampons", "expelled", "throat", "roommate", "rowe", "black", "white", "school", "university", "roommates", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03695306071339131, "subjectivity": 0.4264346535007693},

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["rowes", "justiceforjazzy", "wayshe", "look", "jamaica", "black", "rowe", "white", "kinda", "woman", "south", "jazzy", "brochu"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

Simpson wrote, If I Did It, about how he might have killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman if he were the murderer, which he says he definitely wasn\u2019t?\n\n\n\nBack in 2006, Simpson did a brief publicity tour for the book, including an interview with Fox. Following protests from the Brown and Goldman families and a public backlash, however, the book was scrapped, along with the accompanying promotional interview.\n\nUntil now, that is. Fox has announced that it will be airing the controversial \u201cno holds barred\u201d interview Sunday night to compete with the premiere of another slice of pop culture that America has largely forgotten about: ABC\u2019s American Idol.\n\nBut why air the interview now?\n\nApparently, this time the Brown and Goldman families have given their approval. In a shrewd financial move, the Goldman family acquired the rights to Simpson\u2019s If I Did It in 2007, meaning that Simpson \u201cwill not profit in any way\u201d from the interview being aired, Vulture notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpson has also surged into the public consciousness in a major way in the last two years. His trial was the inspiration for the critically acclaimed The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, a televised drama on FX that starred Sarah Paulson, Cuba Gooding Jr., Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown. He was also the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary directed by Ezra Edelman, O.J.: Made in America.\n\nSimpson was released from a Nevada prison late last year after serving nine years for a botched burglary in a Las Vegas hotel.\n\nThe interview, which Simpson, in a promo video, promises sets the record straight about a story \u201cthe whole world got wrong,\u201d will be hosted by Soledad O\u2019Brien and air on Fox on March 11 at 8 p.m. EST.", "keywords": ["book", "public", "simpson", "goldman", "brown", "families", "fox", "unseen", "air", "oj", "way", "interview", "infamous", "simpsons", "finally"], "polarity": 0.01748321123321124, "subjectivity": 0.325030525030525},

It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict.

Nelson addressed the jury in the second-degree murder trial of George Zimmerman in Florida and read her instructions to the jury (pdf). They included the following:\n\n\n\nIn deciding whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you must judge him by the circumstances by which he was surrounded at the time the force was used. The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual; however, to justify the use of deadly force, the appearance of danger must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person under the same circumstances would have believed that the danger could be avoided only through the use of that force. Based upon appearances, George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real. If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony ... If in your consideration of the issue of self-defense you have a reasonable doubt on the question of whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty.\n\nNelson\u2019s jury instructions mirrored Florida Statute 776.012, which describes the justifiable use of force:\n\n(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force. (2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law was based on a legal precept called the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d which does not require a person with a gun to retreat in the face of danger, but most people know the law by its more famous nickname: \u201cStand your ground.\u201d\n\nThe jury eventually acquitted Zimmerman of the murder of Trayvon Martin, and for three years, no state could pass a version of the law. It was politically toxic in the age of Black Lives Matter, and every state that tried to pass similar legislation failed.\n\nBut in the last few months, under Republican legislatures, \u201cStand your ground\u201d has made a quiet resurgence. In September, Missouri became the first state to enact it since Trayvon\u2019s death. Iowa passed a sweeping gun measure April 13 that lets children handle firearms, allows citizens to sue cities that have \u201cgun-free zones\u201d and makes \u201cStand your ground\u201d state law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Florida is back at it again. According to the New York Times, the Sunshine State is set to strengthen its law by shifting the responsibility of proving immunity from the defendant to prosecutors. In short\u2014in Florida, if you kill another person with a gun and claim that you were defending yourself, it is up to the state to prove that your use of force was not justified.\n\nWhile this may seem like the usual conservative political gambit, there is something larger than the singular murder of Trayvon Martin at issue. \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws have repeatedly been shown to be biased. In fact, study after peer-reviewed study on the issue shows that \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws result in more homicides, and there is no doubt who benefits. Research shows that white men who shoot black men are more likely to benefit from such laws, which means that the resurrection of the castle doctrine will most likely mean that more white men will get away with killing black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012 John Roman of the Urban Institute\u2019s Justice Policy Center conducted a study of \u201cStand your ground\u201d data using FBI statistics. He found that states with \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws reflect the same disparities in homicide convictions found in states without such laws\u2014with one significant exception:\n\nWhites who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be found justified in their killings. In non-Stand Your Ground states, whites are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person; in Stand Your Ground states, that number jumps to 354 percent.\n\nRoman\u2019s findings were still deemed inconclusive because he used data from 2005 to 2009 and had a very low number of comparable white-on-black homicides in \u201cStand your ground\u201d states to compare (25). So Roman doubled back and completed a full, more thorough study and found that when the shooter is black, the homicide is justified in about 1 percent of cases in \u201cStand your ground\u201d states. When a white person kills a black person in a \u201cStand your ground\u201d state, the murder is justified 17 percent of the time (versus 11 percent in states without such laws).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore from Roman:\n\nFinally, I tested whether these racial disparities remained when we controlled for whether the victim and perpetrator were strangers, the state where the incident occurred, the year of the homicide, and whether the shooting occurred in a SYG state. The racial disparities remain large and significant. In fact, the odds that a white-on-black homicide is ruled to have been justified is more than 11 times the odds a black-on-white shooting is ruled justified.\n\nIn another \u201cStand your ground\u201d study that looked solely at cases in Florida, researchers discovered that between 2005 and 2013, Florida juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person as they were to convict in a crime against a person of color. \u201cThese results are similar to pre-civil rights era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is non-white,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data is clear: \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws benefit white people who kill blacks.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard the story of Trevor Dooley, the 69-year-old man who said he was protecting his neighborhood, like another certain neighborhood watchman. Dooley went across the street to shoo away a skateboarder and got into a fight with David James, who was 28 years younger, 6 inches taller and 70 pounds heavier.\n\nDooley pulled out his gun, James lunged for it, they wrestled on the ground and James ended up dead. It sounds eerily similar to the Zimmerman case, except that a judge denied Dooley the use of the \u201cStand your ground\u201d defense. There is one other big difference in the Dooley case: James, the dead man, was white, and Dooley was black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis illustrates the larger point of the racially biased \u201cStand your ground\u201d law. Despite all the statistical and mathematical evidence, America has yet to answer one simple scientific question:\n\nWhich weighs more: a dead black body or a little white lie?", "keywords": ["resurrecting", "zimmerman", "quietly", "kill", "force", "white", "state", "deadly", "person", "blacks", "easier", "ground", "states", "makes", "stand", "justified", "law"], "polarity": 0.09198060209510596, "subjectivity": 0.4692013647929674},

She, however, was not able to claim self-defense and use \u201cStand your ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge in Alexander\u2019s case instructed the jury, as it considered whether Alexander had acted in self-defense, that she had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her husband was committing aggravated battery when she fired. The jury came back with a guilty verdict in 12 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe judge in the Zimmerman murder trial instructed the jury that Zimmerman had no duty to retreat. He was acquitted.\n\n\n\nAdding insult to grievous injury, the same prosecutor from the Zimmerman case, Angela Corey, had the discretion to add a \u201c10-20-life\u201d sentencing enhancement, which requires a 20-year minimum sentence when a firearm is discharged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruthout reports that the Florida Department of Corrections has noted that black people are more than twice as likely as white or Latino people to have the enhancement added to their sentence. And so it was with Alexander. Corey decided to add that enhancement, and Alexander was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\nAlso, although women commit murder far less often than men, they typically receive longer sentences for killing their male partners than men do who kill female partners, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 40-80 percent of women convicted of murder acted in self-defense against their abusers. Alexander didn\u2019t even kill or harm Rico Gray. She just fired a warning shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, an appeals court overturned Alexander\u2019s conviction, and the prosecutor once again charged Alexander with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

When you\u2019re illustrating the complexities of racial prejudice in America, it is difficult to bridge the gap between understanding and skepticism in a populace pretending to listen with its arms folded, ready to dismiss any reasonable, salient point that demonstrates the existence of privilege and bigotry. Sometimes it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t believe racism exists; rather, it\u2019s difficult to provide examples that are clear-cut and easy to understand.\n\nBut not today.\n\nLast week, after President Don \u201cPuffy\u201d Comb-Over claimed on Twitter that his predecessor had wiretapped his phones, Republican lawmakers, having seen no evidence or proof, vowed to investigate. On Monday they began seeking proof of his charges. Even though Donald Trump offered no substance to his charges, they still promised to examine them, understanding that if they were true, it meant one of two things:\n\nEither Barack Obama slithered into his Magical Negro Spider-Man suit, slithered out of the White House, slipped unnoticed into midtown Manhattan and scaled Trump Tower to personally plant listening devices, or the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court determined that there was sufficient evidence to listen in on Trump and issued a warrant to intelligence or law-enforcement agents. If the federal government was listening to Trump\u2019s calls, one of those two things had to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the entire House of Representatives and the Senate, along with federal investigators, the Justice Department, the intelligence community and every other person in the executive branch of the U.S. government, sat on their hands and zipped their lips while Trump accused the former president of the United States of a felony. Lawmakers didn\u2019t just look the other way; they promised to look into the claim\u2014even though they knew it was a lie. By taking this stance, even though they are quite aware that it is impossible to prove a negative\u2014that Obama didn\u2019t tap Trump\u2019s gold rotary desktop telephone\u2014they all tacitly acknowledged that Obama might be a criminal.\n\nBut Obama is black, and black people are used to this.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims do not just exist in the over-the-shoulder reminiscences of yesteryear. They are the latest example, in a number of recent reminders, of how offhand, unsubstantiated accusations against black people in America are so easily accepted, resulting in character assassination and sometimes death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExample: This weekend, two and-a-half years after Michael Brown was gunned down in Ferguson, Mo., surveillance footage emerged that seemed to show Brown exchanging what appears to be marijuana with store clerks minutes before now-former Police Officer Darren Wilson killed him.\n\nThis is significant because the narrative of this case was always that Brown went to a corner store and stole a pack of cigarillos. Minutes later, according to the narrative, Wilson encountered Brown\u2014a \u201chulk\u201d of a man whose adrenaline was pumping after he supposedly committed a forceful, brazen robbery\u2014who grabbed the officer\u2019s gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was easy for prosecutors, a grand jury, conservative voices and the media as a whole to rationalize Brown\u2019s death given the \u201cfacts.\u201d It was believable that a young man who would strong-arm cashiers and loot a business in broad daylight would also be reckless enough to grab a cop\u2019s gun. A policeman should rightfully fear for his life in the presence of such a menace.\n\nExcept that none of it appears to be true. Even without sound, the new video shows what appears to be an illegal but reciprocal exchange. Brown lays a baggie on the counter, and the store clerks pick it up, examines it and holds up a pack of cigars in exchange. Brown never retrieves the bag but gives back the cigarillos. Investigators had this evidence but never presented it, now saying that it is \u201cirrelevant to our investigation.\u201d Even with this new footage, it is unlikely that anyone will ever pay for Brown\u2019s death.\n\nExample: Feb. 26 marked the fifth anniversary of the death of Trayvon Martin, the fifth anniversary of when George Zimmerman shot an unarmed 17-year-old who had committed no crime. Police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman because he told investigators that he shot Trayvon in self-defense after Trayvon fought with him and grabbed his gun. A jury acquitted Zimmerman, even though 911 operators asked him not to follow Trayvon; even after analysis found none of Zimmerman\u2019s DNA under Trayvon\u2019s fingernails following a supposed fight; and despite the fact that Zimmerman\u2019s gun did not have Trayvon\u2019s fingerprints on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Zimmerman said that Trayvon was the aggressor, so he wasn\u2019t arrested until 44 days after he shot the teenager. A jury found Zimmerman not guilty because his shooting of Trayvon in the chest was \u201cnecessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.\u201d Zimmerman said it; therefore it was true. Trayvon is dead because of one person, but no one will ever pay for his death.\n\nExample: Carolyn Bryant, the woman who accused 13-year-old Emmett Till of whistling at her, resulting in his gruesome 1955 death, recently admitted that she made the whole thing up. Bryant chose to wait 62 years after Emmett\u2019s family laid him to rest, and a lifetime after her husband and his accomplice confessed to the murder in Look magazine for $3,000. She outwaited a 2004 Justice Department reinvestigation of the crime. No one ever paid for the murder of Emmett Till because of one person. Emmett is dead because of one person\u2019s statement.\n\nMedia outlets, congress members and senators for weeks have discussed Trump\u2019s bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is no longer speculation; it is fact. Trump\u2019s campaign managers, now-former national security adviser, secretary of state and attorney general, as well as other members of his staff, all have verifiable ties to the Russian government, but to date, there hasn\u2019t been a single real investigation. But as soon as the dimwitted despot tweeted that the black president had violated the rules, everyone was quick to say, \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the way this country has always worked. Demonizing black men is as American as \u201cstrange fruit\u201d-flavored pie. It is easy to condemn the long history of lynchings while pardoning and turning a blind eye to the people who point the fingers that led to nooses around necks. The way Republican lawmakers grabbed their Sherlock Holmes hats after Trump offhandedly accused the only scandal-free president of our lifetime of a federal crime is indicative of the fact that only some people are innocent until proved guilty.\n\nThat\u2019s why a man 50 pounds heavier and 11 years older than a teenager with a pocket full of candy could shoot the boy in the chest and claim that he did it in self-defense. It\u2019s how the Ferguson police, prosecutors and news outlets convinced us that 6-foot-4 Mike Brown was terrorizing his neighborhood like a rabid dog, intimidating and grabbing the weapon of the mild-mannered, elfin, 6-foot-4 Darren Wilson. It\u2019s why the world disregarded Carolyn Bryant\u2019s bloodstained hands for a half a century while Emmett Till\u2019s family still screams for justice.\n\nThis is what it means to be black in America.\n\nPure innocence is not enough to keep your head from being smashed with an anvil and your body wrapped in barbed wire. \u201cDo not talk to strangers\u201d is an inadequate safety message when a man can stalk your son and shoot him in the chest, and people will eagerly bid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gun that did it. Even a heralded black man with a reputation so spotless that he somehow becomes the leader of the free world is still lesser than a white, imbecilic, dishonest dictator-in-training. Imagine how scary it must be to live in a world where you can be undone by any words uttered from a white mouth\u2014even if they aren\u2019t true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t point out the effects of unfounded white accusations against black bodies. Instead, we will make a universal blanket proclamation that encompasses all of these incidents, hoping that our inclusive statement will cause some people to hear the words we have been too long shouting at our dear America:\n\nAll lies matter.", "keywords": ["teach", "mike", "martin", "zimmerman", "brown", "man", "black", "till", "white", "trump", "emmett", "obama", "tweets", "trayvon", "trumps", "president"], "polarity": 0.005504046354561809, "subjectivity": 0.4822140774460359},

Entrekin got a $592,000 mortgage from Peoples Bank of Alabama, and the property became one of several that the couple owned together or separately in the state\u2019s Etowah and Baldwin counties. All of the properties rang up a total assessed value of more than $1.7 million.\n\nBut again, Entrekin is a sheriff, with a five-figure annual salary. So residents started to question how he could afford multiple homes, including one that cost almost three-quarters of a million bucks.\n\nAs it turns out, Entrekin readily filed ethics-disclosure forms revealing that over the past three years he pocketed some $750,000 of additional \u201ccompensation\u201d from \u201cfood provisions.\u201d That would be on top of his $93,178.80 annual salary as sheriff.\n\nThose food-provisions funds were actually allocated by federal, state and municipal governments to feed inmates in the county jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how could Entrekin be so barefaced about it? Well, to hear him tell the story, it\u2019s a simple matter of law (of course it is). AL.com notes that many Alabama sheriffs believe that pocketing \u201cexcess\u201d food funds is legal under a state law that was passed before World War II. \u201cYet in a number of counties including Jefferson and Montgomery, any money allocated to sheriffs for feeding inmates that is not used for that purpose is instead turned over to the county government,\u201d AL.com reports.\n\n\u201cIn regards to feeding of inmates, we utilize a registered dietitian to ensure adequate meals are provided daily,\u201d Entrekin told the news site. \u201cAs you should be aware, Alabama law is clear as to my personal financial responsibilities in the feeding of inmates. Regardless of one\u2019s opinion of this statute, until the legislature acts otherwise, the sheriff must follow the current law.\u201d\n\nEntrekin reported on forms filed to the Alabama Ethics Commission that he made \u201cmore than $250,000\u201d each of the past three years in this manner. Executive Director of the Ethics Commission Tom Albritton noted that the state does not mandate that public officials disclose exactly how much income they receive from one source beyond the $250,000 threshold, which he described as being \u201cspecifically set in the statute.\u201d", "keywords": ["funds", "jailhouse", "extra", "county", "law", "money", "sheriff", "etowah", "feeding", "entrekin", "inmates", "bought", "alabama", "pocketed", "state", "beach", "food", "house"], "polarity": 0.1435897435897436, "subjectivity": 0.3034798534798535},

What should I bring?\n\nThis one\u2019s dicey because, in your mind, you\u2019re probably thinking that you should answer their call as if it\u2019s some kind of cultural exchange where you\u2019ll have some of their native dishes and you\u2019ll bring one of yours in kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen it comes to how the food is seasoned, prepared, cooked and presented, you gotta really have a thorough understanding of the black folks you\u2019re dealing with before you just start showing up with random shit. Is this a pork house or a nonpork house? Are they cool with coleslaw? Is this a Hennessy or a Remy family? Too many variables, man. Don\u2019t chance it. Besides, they\u2019re going to ask you to bring a nonperishable item to keep it simple for you, so chances are you\u2019re getting plates anyway.\n\n\n\nBut if you do start feeling inspired and want to make your Oma\u2019s special-recipe green-bean-and-wheat salad, stop.

You can never go wrong with napkins \u2026 or ice, \u2019cause we know Marvin an\u2019nem always forget that shit.\n\nWhen do I get to use the n-word?\n\nNever. The answer is never. Not even if you stay friends for the next 55 years and find yourselves sitting next to each other in the home whilst Wu-Tang plays in the background of your bingo game. It\u2019s \u201cShame on a nuh\u201d for you forever.

Anybody who cops the \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d plea is immediately suspect to all black people. Saying that you don\u2019t see race is essentially admitting that you\u2019re so willing to deny your own biases that you\u2019ll revoke part of someone else\u2019s identity to make you feel better about your inadequacies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t believe me?

(Sidenote: How does a video vixen retire? Does she turn in her performance thong and wedges? Just wondering.)\n\n\n\nSomehow, unbeknownst to any black person with a high school diploma or an equivalency degree, O.J. became the symbolic embodiment of black people, as far as white people were concerned. Maybe it was because he wanted so badly to be appreciated by them; maybe it was because during his trial on charges of killing Nicole Simpson and Goldman, black America embraced O.J. in a way that even took O.J. aback. Truthfully, what black America was embracing was an opportunity to challenge a racist, oppressive judicial system that continuously feeds on black and brown bodies, and O.J. just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nBut on this Thursday, on this day of Our Lord and Savior Stephen Curry, let me let white folks in on a little secret: Black folks don\u2019t fuck with O.J. Truthfully, we never really did. In fact, we didn\u2019t care if O.J. served 200 years inside the sunken place, inside a boot that was placed squarely up his own ass. We don\u2019t ride for O.J. no more. That\u2019s so 2000.

In the backs of our minds, we all just figured that O.J. would stay in prison, contract some incurable disease and slowly die off the way that Hill Street Blues and Coolio have before him. In fact, we were taking bets on whether Orenthal J. Simpson was going to walk out a free man after serving almost nine years in prison for, get this, taking his own shit back!\n\nI know that the law calls this stealing, but what has always been troubling to me is how someone can steal O.J.\u2019s stuff, which the men who were robbed admitted to doing; then O.J. not only finds out that the stuff is stolen but goes to get it back, and the state awards him all the items, which he reportedly \u201cstole,\u201d but O.J. still gets 33 years in prison. That\u2019s ultimate white justice. Black folks knew that this was payback for the acquittal on the murder charges. And soon, O.J. will be free, which means he will go back to being O.J., and, sadly, he\u2019s black America\u2019s George Zimmerman, but more charming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during his parole hearing, which was televised, O.J. reached into his Naked Gun acting trick bag to pull out a few moves that would make young Denzel, before the big-teeth memes, jealous. O.J. was affable and funny and remorseful and convincing. He was dinner-party O.J. at his finest because O.J. can\u2019t stop O.J.-ing, which means I give him three days after his release before he\u2019s caught on a TMZ video saying some freakishly dumb shit. I give him a few weeks before he\u2019s on the golf course, and a few years before O.J. is back in jail because the one telling sign that O.J. hasn\u2019t changed one bit came when he was drilled on whether or not he attended Alcoholics Anonymous classes as instructed during his last parole hearing in 2013.\n\nO.J. waxed on about being a Christian and how he hadn\u2019t gone to AA but had found other classes that he thought were better, like conflict resolution.

According to SFGate, doctors now want to expand the project in more cities across the country.\n\n\n\nUncontrolled high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of premature disability and death among black men. To make matters worse, distrust and discomfort around physicians and hospitals means that black men are less likely than black women to see a doctor. Getting beyond the hospital and into the community, then, is vital.\n\n\n\nAs Medical Xpress reports, the study included more than 300 black men recruited from 52 barbershops in the Los Angeles area, all of whom had blood pressure readings high enough to put them at high risk of heart attack and stroke. The site details how the trial was conducted:\n\nThe men were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group\u2019s barbers encouraged patrons to meet with specially trained pharmacists who met the men monthly in the barbershop\u2014where they prescribed blood pressure medication, monitored blood tests and then sent progress notes to each patron\u2019s primary care provider. In the second group, barbers encouraged their patrons to follow up with a primary care provider for treatment and make lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise and decreasing salt consumption.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial lasted a year. In at least one barbershop, California Healthline reports, a blood pressure machine was installed that sent patients\u2019 readings directly to their doctors or the visiting pharmacist.\n\nThe results were a \u201chome run,\u201d according to an independent medical expert interviewed by SFGate.\n\nBoth groups saw substantial blood pressure drops. When the study began, participants had a top pressure number that averaged 154 over 80 (130 or below is considered normal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter six months, men who just received advice and counsel from their barbers saw their blood pressure fall by 9 points. For those who had the extra support of the pharmacist in the shop, it fell by a whopping 27 points on average.\n\nBy the end of the study, two-thirds of the men who met with pharmacists in the barbershop lowered their blood pressure to 130. Meanwhile, 12 percent of the men who just received advice from their barber saw their blood pressure drop to normal levels.\n\nNaturally, The Root\u2019s senior barbershop correspondent, Michael Harriot, had some questions:\n\nHow are they going to take your blood pressure with that one badass kid running around?\n\nWill there be one pharmacist whom no one wants to go to because he fucked up your blood work last time?\n\nAre we sure we want medical information in the same place that spreads conspiracy theories like drinking through a straw can make you gay? (Harriot would also like to confirm that, yes, this is an actual conspiracy he\u2019s heard in a barbershop.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, how do you tip someone on blood work?\n\nAll jokes aside, the results of the barbershop study illuminate a new path in overcoming a long-standing (and well-earned) distrust among black Americans and physicians that has prevented some patients from receiving the care they need. This trust barrier makes it all the more difficult for black male patients to get the sort of sustained treatment that chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension require.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant effect for a hypertension trial of any kind,\u201d said Dr. Ronald G. Victor, associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and the study\u2019s lead author. Victor, too, suffers from high blood pressure, which was diagnosed by his barber in Dallas when he conducted his first study of this kind in the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Victor pointed out, hypertension requires a lifelong commitment to taking medications and changing one\u2019s lifestyle, and extra support and contact are necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is often challenging to get people who need blood pressure medication to take them, even as costs and side effects have gone down over the years. With this program, we have been able to overcome that barrier,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the trial lasted just a year, there are signs that its participants are carrying the study\u2019s lessons forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne barber who participated in the study, Corey Thomas, told California Healthline that he continues to talk to his customers about hypertension even though the study is over\u2014and the blood pressure machine in his shop is still available for anyone to use.\n\n\u201cA lot of us use the emergency room as doctors,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo I think [these] studies will help out a great deal.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["cutting", "pressure", "black", "blood", "place", "study", "key", "barbershop", "trial", "hypertension", "high", "men"], "polarity": 0.09416416468835824, "subjectivity": 0.46743832332542},

We thought we\u2019d check in with some people who worked in the industry before rules around pre-existing conditions and mental health parity were enacted: people whose jobs involved daily management of strangers\u2019 treatment, from an air-conditioned board room or an office building or a call center.\n\n\n\nInterviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJeremy Beckham, 33, insurance sales, Wisconsin\n\nI was in sales between the ages of 19 and 21. I\u2019d worked in other sales call centers, but the way the call center industry was, insurance sales was a higher-paying job.\n\nWhen I was first hired\u2014this is one of the top five insurance companies in the country\u2014I had to go through a trainer and licenser program. I was licensed to sell health and life insurance telephonically in 26 states. I want to stress that even though I worked for this one company for two years, everything that happened there was very typical of the industry. I\u2019m not trying to tar and feather anybody specifically. There\u2019s barely one bit of difference between any of these companies.\n\nSo people would call and say, \u201cI\u2019m trying to get health insurance for me or my family or my kid,\u201d and I\u2019d try to sell them health, life, and dental, all individual plans. Part of that process is that you screen people for pre-existing conditions. There were three different stages of screening. The first thing, right at the beginning of the call, I\u2019d ask a couple questions sort of off-the-cuff. Frankly, if I knew they were going to be declined, I was wasting my time talking to them.\n\nSo I\u2019d ask, casually, whether they had a history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, heart attacks. Kind of develop a rapport. That caught a pretty good chunk, diabetes especially. And I asked all that before I even made the sales pitch, so the phone call would be, like, two minutes long. If they got declined I\u2019d tell them what other options they had, based on what state they were in. I had a computer terminal that told me what each state offered. Florida was pretty good. Some states had literally nothing, and that was pretty hard. All I could say is, call other companies, knowing they would decline them. Maybe I\u2019d tell them to find employment somewhere with group health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if they made it through those kind of off-the-cuff questions, we\u2019d go to the application process. On the very first screen on my computer console, it listed something like 20 of the most common conditions that would cause someone to be declined. If they had any of those there was no point in going further. They were things like chronic obesity, pulmonary disease, chronic inflammation, ulcerative colitis. If at any point in your life you\u2019d had a heart attack or a stroke, declined. Most forms of cancer, but not all. Pregnancy.\n\nIt was so routine to inspire deep anxiety in people.\n\nFor many people, this was not the first insurance place they called. They had already been declined. On our applications, there was a question that was like, \u201cHave you ever been declined from another company?\u201d But there\u2019s so much uniformity; you either qualified with one of us or none at all. Pregnancy was an issue, too, though if you were single and pregnant you weren\u2019t always up shit\u2019s creek. Many of the states allowed you to get on Medicaid, which was almost always a better plan than what I was selling, anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo after that list of 20 questions, we\u2019d really get to the meat. It was like, a 45-minute phone call, maybe. Question: Have you or anyone on this policy ever had asthma? A history of osteoporosis? It was close to 100 questions. And after we completed it, I\u2019d go to the underwriting department. They\u2019d look at the application, and obtain people\u2019s medical records from the Medical Information Bureau, and they had the final say. Sometimes they\u2019d approve them cleanly, sometimes they\u2019d flat-out deny. Or they\u2019d approve you with a premium rate adjustment, like, we\u2019re going to approve you but your BMI is too high and you\u2019re obese so we\u2019re going to give you a 25% premium rate increase.\n\nSome things, like asthma, we\u2019d approve you, but with a rider. If you need an inhaler, or an emergency visit for an asthma attack, we\u2019d give you a policy that covers everything except that. People would be like, that\u2019s the whole reason I wanted to plan! Sometimes the underwriter would uncover that the person lied to me, and I don\u2019t really but every time you file a claim, all those insurance companies are sharing the information with each other. So that would be an awkward conversation I\u2019d have to have.\n\nThere were horrible moments, fairly frequently. I got through it because you rationalize it in various ways. You know, I just work here at the call center, I don\u2019t make the rules. But there was a lot of moral discomfort. I remember many times having to console people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is one of the strangest circumstances, but I encountered it a lot: Sometimes when a mother and father split up, it was common for the mother to get sole custody, and the father to be required by law to get insurance for the kid as part of his child support. If he violates that, he can go to jail, be held in contempt. But we screened children just as we screened adults.\n\nI would get calls from these fathers, but the kid would have a condition: autism, obesity, diabetes. And we\u2019d have to tell the father, \u201cWe can\u2019t insure your son.\u201d He\u2019d be like, I\u2019m going to jail. I\u2019d maybe send an email or something, but even judges in our legal system did not understand you couldn\u2019t just go out and get health insurance. I\u2019d be like, \u201cNo one is going to insure this autistic son.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be like, \u201cNo one is going to insure this autistic son.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne call I remember, we went all the way to the underwriter, and she got declined. It was a whole family: a wife and husband, and a couple of kids. I was dealing with the mother and one of the questions was about infertility treatment. Our plan by default did not cover infertility treatment. She said yes, I did have infertility treatment, but I don\u2019t want it anymore. I\u2019m done, I don\u2019t want any more kids. She was still declined, and I called the underwriter. Here was the explanation: By law if you insure a woman and that women has a child, you are insuring the baby from the moment of birth. And women who have infertility treatments, research shows they have a higher risk of complications in pregnancies, babies with lower birth rates. So it\u2019s riskier, but the idea was that since we don\u2019t want to insure this baby that she\u2019s never going to have, we\u2019re not going to insure her.\n\nIt was so routine to inspire deep anxiety in people. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say a quarter of the calls I received were declines. If we get rid of the rules around denying people for pre-existing conditions, it\u2019s going to go back to to that. I can\u2019t believe how short our memories are, we\u2019re going down the same fucking road. And what, expecting these companies to suddenly have morals. And even if you\u2019re a shrewd capitalist, and think every business has the right to be concerned with the bottom line\u2014what if you have diabetes? They\u2019re just going to view you as a bad bet.\n\n\n\nAdam Nikolai, 41, insurance company project manager, Minnesota\n\nI started working at the call center right out of high school, in \u201899. But I had a pretty broad skill set so I advanced pretty quickly. It wasn\u2019t as bad as you think\u2014I\u2019d worked in collections before that. But I ended up doing just about everything. Before I left I had moved up three levels as a project manager, which was top-level projects handling the implementation of new networks and new systems. I worked there until 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny time the company had a new initiative that they wanted to pursue, that was called a project. So whether it was a new type of policy that we wanted to create, or a new network partnership\u2014if we wanted to partner with Aetna to access their doctors and hospitals, for example. A company is a massive beast, you need a person to kind of drive that and get all the areas that are impacted together. But any project manager will tell you 40 percent of their jobs is giving status reports.\n\nThe whole business is risk management, which was really drilled into us from the first day: It\u2019s constant in the ambiance, from the corporate motto to the materials, from when you walk in the door to get trained to every time the CEO speaks in a big company meeting. I worked at a health insurance company that was based on the idea that it was a for-profit industry. And I don\u2019t blame them for any of this stuff. It makes sense if you\u2019re going to take an insurance policy and your goal is to make profit, you need to manage your risk and exposure. That\u2019s where stuff like pre-existing conditions and underwriting and late payments comes into play. I think we need to make a decision as a nation whether we want health care to be for-profit or not.\n\nI worked at a health insurance company that was based on the idea that it was a for-profit industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is that our CEO was very involved in the development of the ACA, he was out of the office all the time and we were getting all these emails with updates from him. He could get where people were coming from, with all the hate around pre-existing conditions and lifetime maximums. But we couldn\u2019t get rid of those things because then we\u2019d only have sick people, and we\u2019d go out of business. That\u2019s just how the math works. So the flip side of that is, you know, if we\u2019re going to get rid of all those things, we need to expand the pool and we need to have everybody involved. We need to have everybody insured. And for those of you paying attention at home, that\u2019s exactly what happened. And yet within a year or two the message from on high was, \u201cOh, we hate the ACA now.\u201d\n\nHonestly a big part of the reason I think we didn\u2019t get involved in the first year is because they weren\u2019t sure exchanges were going to exist the next year because the ACA was under constant assault. The House was trying to repeal it like four times a week.\n\nI didn\u2019t get into the nitty gritty of individual claims. But\u2014and I don\u2019t think a lot of people get this\u2014it\u2019s not like people in health insurance see the insured as faceless entities. There would be some very passionate arguments on the inside when a claim was denied and people appealed it, or when we thought a person was suffering. There was a way to interpret a contract in a way that would pay, rather than not pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin a year or two the message from on high was, \u201cOh, we hate the ACA now.\u201d\n\nA lot of the time it was around inpatient hospital bills that run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or emergency room bills. And we didn\u2019t have mental health parity at the time, so if someone went in to the emergency room for an anxiety attack, we\u2019d have to figure out if it gets covered as an emergency benefit, which is really generous, or as a mental health benefit. It\u2019s a good example, because people would think they were having a heart attack. And then boom, the doctor says you\u2019re having an anxiety attack, and it\u2019s a mental health issue, and there isn\u2019t coverage so that\u2019s $500, sorry. That argument would come up fairly often and it wasn\u2019t always decided the same way.\n\n\n\nWhen the ACA first came out, I thought it was a fantastic idea. I thought it was a very American approach to the idea. But then I saw all the sabotage and the undercutting, just ridiculous claims about socialism and death panels and just this constant whining. They did everything they could to get their political point across and they\u2019re literally killing people. So at this stage of the game I\u2019m a single payer guy, full stop. We tried to do it the American way. That didn\u2019t work, so let\u2019s do it the Canadian way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy, 42, medical billing and claims, New York\n\nI worked as a biller for a few doctor\u2019s practices, about 15 years ago. And before that I worked processing claims for a local medical insurer with about 100 employees. I really only worked for the insurer for about a year because it was getting a bit soul-crushing listening to people cry on the phone when I would deny their claims. But that was the job. Deny if at all possible. Pre-existing conditions were a big, big thing then. We would deny anything if we felt we could get away with it. I hope that\u2019s better now than it was, years back.\n\nPeople\u2019s coinsurance would be so high, they couldn\u2019t keep up with the bills. And it was my job to inform them we couldn\u2019t treat them anymore. That was horrible because I was talking to very sick people who needed care. I got tired of being the bad guy in that regard so I had to leave that line of work behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that was the job. Deny if at all possible.\n\nLater when I worked in billing at a small doctor\u2019s practice I could spend hours trying to work on a single claim. It just wasn\u2019t cost-efficient, dealing with private insurance. Most of the doctors I worked for were having trouble making payroll. The practices I worked for each had five or six physicians who were also surgeons. The Medicare claims were really what was keeping the doors open. Medicare is easy: treat the patient, check a box, get paid. No hoops to jump through.\n\nI didn\u2019t really deal with patients by that point. It was just me in a cubicle on the phone arguing with Blue Cross. They would deny for the most ridiculous reasons. Their favorite game to play was to ignore my numerous claim submissions. Then once the filing date passed they would tell me I missed the filing deadline even though I could prove I had submitted it several times on time. They just don\u2019t want to pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost people believe doctors hate Medicare, when in fact they love it. Claim-filing and payment is easy. They didn\u2019t even mind taking slightly smaller fees because their administrative costs were so much lower. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a doctor who doesn\u2019t take traditional Medicare. Not so much with the Advantage plans. Dealing with them is pretty much like dealing with private insurance.\n\nWhich is why I hate private insurance with such a fiery passion. It\u2019s an evil business. It\u2019s not just patients being hurt. It\u2019s doctors, too.\n\nJennifer Johnson, 56, contract negotiator, West Virginia\n\nI negotiated insurance contracts for a hospital and health care system in West Virginia for 15 years as the director of strategic services. My husband\u2019s a consultant in the pharma industry. We\u2019ve kind of been in health care all our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy dad was an orthopedic surgeon, so I helped in his office and actually I remember the days when I was a teenager where you had to hand-write all the insurance bills. Just to submit. I learned really from the ground up. I\u2019ve billed insurance. I\u2019ve called insurance companies. I moved into negotiation. I was in charge of the marketing department, as well.\n\nI left the whole industry because of troubling moments when I really felt I\u2019d lost my soul.\n\nI think the big thing people don\u2019t understand about commercial insurance is that, unlike Medicare, which has decided what a fair price point for something is, the individual insurance companies look at our case mix\u2014what kinds of specific surgeries we do on a daily basis\u2014and decide how much they\u2019re going to pay. So one company might say, for a knee surgery, they\u2019ll pay $7,000. Another will say they\u2019ll only pay $5,000. I negotiated big contracts like that about every year. We used to negotiate a lot with PEIA, which is a health insurance company in West Virginia. You might have heard that the teachers walked out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were a private hospital and a non-profit. We had a cardiac center. Because we took a lot more critical care patients, those negotiated rates might really go down on something like cardiac care. Companies don\u2019t want to pay the big bucks for that. A lot of it made no rhyme or reason. A lot of it was like, okay, if you guys aren\u2019t going to pay for cardiac, then you\u2019re going to pay for these other procedures, like outpatient orthopedic, where we can get people in and out quickly. It was like a game to figure it out: getting into specific codes for specific procedures line-by-line. We had our little cubby with our computer and a shelf of books, everything you need to know about Medicare, Medicaid, PEIA, workers comp, how to bill all these different insurance codes.\n\nI worked for the chief legal officer, so it was myself and him. But they pulled me into the negotiations a lot because that was my strength. But it was mostly executives that would sit in in these meetings with the insurance companies. And it was just horrid. I was also on the executive board of a charitable foundation, and I left the whole industry because of troubling moments when I really felt I\u2019d lost my soul.\n\nWe were advocates for people who didn\u2019t have health care, the homeless. So if someone came in and had heart surgery and they were on Medicaid or they didn\u2019t have insurance, we\u2019re write off a good portion of the bill or set up payment plans. But even being a private non-profit charitable hospital some of the decisions that the executives made about who is going to get care and who is getting treatment, from a charity perspective, it was just horrible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe focus was always to expand, and on profits. Working with insurance you get calls from people just crying: I just got my bill, I can\u2019t pay this. And there was a process, patients would sit down with our financial services and go through their paychecks and things. But sometimes I swear people were denied simply because the executive director in the billing department didn\u2019t like the tone of the person on the phone. And you know the executives got huge bonuses, enough to buy a car. And people are not getting the health care they need.\n\nThe focus was always to expand, and on profits.\n\nAll my friends are still doctors in West Virginia, and Obamacare really was a good thing; the bad thing was that doctor\u2019s weren\u2019t paid as much. I left when we moved to Europe; my husband had been flying globally and having me working full-time just wasn\u2019t working anymore. And I started coaching tennis when we moved to Switzerland. It\u2019s always been a passion, tennis. But Switzerland is really the gold standard for health care. I was really impressed when we lived in the UK, too: I had no problems, I could see my general practitioner any time same day within 24 hours. Specialists took a little time. Sorry if I\u2019m rambling!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was really heartbreaking, working in West Virginia. It was a university town, so it wasn\u2019t exactly like what you think of as down-home Trump\u2019s America. But you still had coal-miners coming in with lung cancer. The mission is to help as many people as you can. That\u2019s why we\u2019d do community health fairs, raising awareness. But, you know, it\u2019s the insurance companies. They have all the power, really.\n\n", "keywords": ["dont", "really", "going", "care", "glimpse", "bureaucratic", "health", "hell", "worked", "id", "lot", "insurance", "company", "claims", "denying"], "polarity": 0.04336882605583394, "subjectivity": 0.4402281390962494},

According to SFGate, doctors now want to expand the project in more cities across the country.\n\n\n\nUncontrolled high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of premature disability and death among black men. To make matters worse, distrust and discomfort around physicians and hospitals means that black men are less likely than black women to see a doctor. Getting beyond the hospital and into the community, then, is vital.\n\n\n\nAs Medical Xpress reports, the study included more than 300 black men recruited from 52 barbershops in the Los Angeles area, all of whom had blood pressure readings high enough to put them at high risk of heart attack and stroke. The site details how the trial was conducted:\n\nThe men were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group\u2019s barbers encouraged patrons to meet with specially trained pharmacists who met the men monthly in the barbershop\u2014where they prescribed blood pressure medication, monitored blood tests and then sent progress notes to each patron\u2019s primary care provider. In the second group, barbers encouraged their patrons to follow up with a primary care provider for treatment and make lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise and decreasing salt consumption.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial lasted a year. In at least one barbershop, California Healthline reports, a blood pressure machine was installed that sent patients\u2019 readings directly to their doctors or the visiting pharmacist.\n\nThe results were a \u201chome run,\u201d according to an independent medical expert interviewed by SFGate.\n\nBoth groups saw substantial blood pressure drops. When the study began, participants had a top pressure number that averaged 154 over 80 (130 or below is considered normal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter six months, men who just received advice and counsel from their barbers saw their blood pressure fall by 9 points. For those who had the extra support of the pharmacist in the shop, it fell by a whopping 27 points on average.\n\nBy the end of the study, two-thirds of the men who met with pharmacists in the barbershop lowered their blood pressure to 130. Meanwhile, 12 percent of the men who just received advice from their barber saw their blood pressure drop to normal levels.\n\nNaturally, The Root\u2019s senior barbershop correspondent, Michael Harriot, had some questions:\n\nHow are they going to take your blood pressure with that one badass kid running around?\n\nWill there be one pharmacist whom no one wants to go to because he fucked up your blood work last time?\n\nAre we sure we want medical information in the same place that spreads conspiracy theories like drinking through a straw can make you gay? (Harriot would also like to confirm that, yes, this is an actual conspiracy he\u2019s heard in a barbershop.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, how do you tip someone on blood work?\n\nAll jokes aside, the results of the barbershop study illuminate a new path in overcoming a long-standing (and well-earned) distrust among black Americans and physicians that has prevented some patients from receiving the care they need. This trust barrier makes it all the more difficult for black male patients to get the sort of sustained treatment that chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension require.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant effect for a hypertension trial of any kind,\u201d said Dr. Ronald G. Victor, associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and the study\u2019s lead author.

Olympia was born on Sept. 1, 2017.\n\nThe pregnancy was smooth, Williams says, but 24 hours after she gave birth, a slew of complications kept the new mother in bed for nearly six weeks.\n\nWilliams writes:\n\nIt began with a pulmonary embolism, which is a condition in which one or more arteries in the lungs becomes blocked by a blood clot. Because of my medical history with this problem, I live in fear of this situation. So, when I fell short of breath, I didn\u2019t wait a second to alert the nurses. This sparked a slew of health complications that I am lucky to have survived. First my C-section wound popped open due to the intense coughing I endured as a result of the embolism. I returned to surgery, where the doctors found a large hematoma, a swelling of clotted blood, in my abdomen. And then I returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from traveling to my lungs. When I finally made it home to my family, I had to spend the first six weeks of motherhood in bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams acknowledges that in her ordeal, she had privileges not afforded to many: a strong, committed team of doctors and nurses and state-of-the-art equipment, for instance. Had it not been for their able care, Williams writes, she may have died.\n\nBut the point of telling her story, which she also shared in an earlier interview for Vogue\u2019s February issue, was to illustrate the vast discrepancies in maternal care that women from different races and backgrounds experience. Provoked by her near-death experience, Williams looked more deeply into inequity and maternal care, and was bothered by the lack of action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black women in the United States are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes,\u201d Williams writes. She adds that outside the U.S., limited access to prenatal and maternal care means that millions of women have the cards similarly \u201cstacked against them.\u201d\n\nAs another CNN article notes, instances of maternal death have increased across racial groups in the U.S. in recent years, but the racial divide in deaths has persisted. The issue has been brought to the forefront recently as high-profile cases like the death of Shalon Irving, an expert on racial disparities in health care, and Williams\u2019 complications have been reported and discussed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of her essay, Williams implores readers to demand action from governments, businesses and health care providers to protect the lives of babies and their mothers.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, you become part of this narrative,\u201d Williams writes, \u201cmaking sure that one day, who you are or where you are from does not decide whether your baby gets to live or to die.\u201d", "keywords": ["learned", "racial", "care", "giving", "complications", "writes", "neardeath", "williams", "serena", "maternal", "health", "reveals", "birth", "experience", "women"], "polarity": 0.150748556998557, "subjectivity": 0.47032026615359945},

Galanter represented Simpson during the 2008 trial when he got hit for nine years minimum and 33 years maximum for a dubious but dumb-AF kidnapping charge. \u201cParole in the state of Nevada is really based on how you behave in prison, and by all accounts he\u2019s been a model prisoner,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Galanter also said, \u201cThere are no absolutes anytime you\u2019re dealing with administrative boards, but this is as close to a nonpersonal decision as you can get.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given the notoriety of the Simpson trial and O.J.

(More like deaf, dumb and blind).\n\nUSA Today reports:\n\nFour members from the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners will consider parole for Simpson at the board offices in Carson City, Nev., with the proceedings set to begin Thursday at 1 p.m. ET. ... Parole is largely determined by a point system, and how the commissioners feel about Simpson\u2014or his acquittal in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman\u2014can have no impact on parole, according to Galanter. \u201cIt really is based on points,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cHow long have you served, what your disciplinary record is, what the likelihood of committing another crime is, their age, the facts and the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimpson is currently locked up because he broke into a Las Vegas hotel room on Sept. 13, 2007, and stole at gunpoint sports memorabilia he claimed was his. More than a year later, on Oct. 8, 2008, he was found guilty by a jury on all 12 charges.\n\nHe was granted parole in 2013 on the armed robbery convictions.\n\nThe parole board has said it will issue a decision Thursday so as to minimize the media circus that will surely follow its decree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Simpson is paroled, I get one Alexander Hamilton, and Simpson walks out of prison on Oct. 1 at the age of 70 \u2026 a life eons longer than those of other black men accused of far less.

If this is 2016 and I\u2019m still a freelance writer, I\u2019m losing money immediately on the assignments I can\u2019t complete because my vision is blurry and my thoughts are erratic. If this is 2013, I am soon taken off the roster at the cafe where I work.\n\nI am out of my mind with anxiety as I hobble to the clinic, sweating, and pay $60 for cough syrup, $300 for the 10-minute visit (if I even have that in the bank; it\u2019s about a week\u2019s worth of my earnings slinging coffee). Once I realize I can\u2019t keep down the cough syrup and start spitting up bile, maybe I\u2019m so feverish and broke I stay in bed without realizing the bacteria I\u2019ve inhaled is more lethal than the flu. So perhaps I just up and die right there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s say I somehow make it to the hospital. A friend drives me, because a 15-minute ambulance ride can cost nearly $2,000, which I don\u2019t have. I\u2019m struggling financially and I\u2019ve fallen behind on my ACA payments. My friend realizes in the car I\u2019m not making any sense, and that\u2019s because my organs have already begun to shut down. My temperature is well over 100. When the doctors can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong, they submit me to a credit check before advanced treatment.\n\nMy credit is awful. I have a massive, unpaid bill from a few years back when someone made international calls on my stolen phone. Maybe, because of this, I\u2019m transferred to a public hospital, where there aren\u2019t 20-odd specialists to arrange an \u201cunusual\u201d surgery. Doctors are required to stabilize a patient, but they aren\u2019t required to, say, stabilize a patient just long enough to keep them breathing and take them to another hospital with a full infectious disease wing to do something risky. So maybe that\u2019s when I die, before they even figure out what\u2019s wrong, because I\u2019m not the type of patient whose financial health can support an elaborate, life-saving procedure.\n\nBut even if the hospital could be convinced to ignore my distinct lack of liquidity, in one of these alternate timelines I don\u2019t have a parent with the time and language skills and resources to come down to New York and negotiate with doctors who need a legal surrogate to parse a series of difficult options. It\u2019s not like I can do it myself, in a medically induced coma. And already, two days after being admitted, I am racking up bills for anesthesia, the input of six specialists, radiology, and antibiotics that come to nearly $30,000. And without the treatment, which costs an additional $12,705 for just for a few hours of the surgeon\u2019s time, I am dead.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine, though, that I get lucky and my mother makes it to New York in time. She demands they do anything within their power to save me and puts up for the surgery, using her own credit. She convinces the paper-pushers she\u2019s good for the bills. I am, after all, her only child. I\u2019m in the ICU for 10 days; the baseline cost can be up to $10,000 a night, which doesn\u2019t include the ventilators, the sensors, the multiple IV drips jacked directly into my neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time I\u2019m out of the hospital, we have been billed $642,650.76. If this is a few years earlier, the well-regarded medical center where I have just spent nearly a month is flat-out refusing requests for financial aid, sending bills for emergency surgery to a collection agency that puts liens on the homes of patients\u2019 families and forces them to foreclose. I\u2019m probably not aware this is happening until I\u2019m back in my apartment, on a three-times-daily schedule of antibiotic IV treatments, which have to be administered by a home nurse. She\u2019s expensive.\n\nIn this version of the story, I have survived, but been without a paycheck for the better part of the summer. Around the time I run out of oxycodone and start waking up in tears, completely paralyzed by pain, the medical bills have begun to pile up on my stoop. I am woozy, spending long, featureless days in bed, trying to remember what kind of person I had been before I went under, and I need help to raise my scooped-out torso from bed. I can\u2019t lift anything or cook for myself or walk more than a block. Maybe I fester for awhile in a rehab center, in the absence of there being anyone readily available to make sure I don\u2019t waste away.\n\nNever mind recovering physically or financially in any of these scenarios: I can\u2019t imagine surviving emotionally, fielding calls from collections agents, facing eviction, waiting for the pain meds to hit so I can keep at a futile job search with an IV still dangling from my side. I am 29 years old, with no pre-existing conditions before this moment, and I am unemployed and exhausted and in pain all the time.\n\nOf course, this is not what happened to me. I am not one of the 28 million Americans who are completely uninsured, or one of the 45,000 people who die every year for lack of coverage. I am not one of the 3/4 of U.S. citizens who don\u2019t have access to paid sick leave, and I don\u2019t live in one of the 45 states without short-term disability plans. I\u2019m not one of the 30 percent of insured consumers who are slapped with hefty surprise bills after a hospital visit. Which is why I did not become one of the millions of people who default on their medical debt every year, regularly making healthcare bills the leading cause of bankruptcy in this country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, on that second Tuesday in June 2017, I found myself in what I worry could be a fleeting moment in my life, one in which the institutions around me find it advantageous to protect rather than screw me. I find it baffling that, since my illness, well-meaning people have repeatedly referred to me as a \u201csurvivor,\u201d as if the fact that I got to go on with my life had to do with some inherent moral strength, rather than the material forces put in motion long before I got sick.\n\nThat whole week last June, I worked from home, assuring my editor I\u2019d be back in the office shortly. \u201cI haven\u2019t been this sick since I was, like, 8 years old dude!\u201d I told her over Slack, the same day I would be put into quarantine. We have generous time-off policies in our newsroom, thanks in large part to our union. I was told to rest and get better. I didn\u2019t.\n\nI spent months of my life at the mercy of people with the capacity\u2014and perhaps more importantly, the incentive\u2014to care for me.\n\nA major feature of a person\u2019s twenties is that while you\u2019re ostensibly old enough to take care of yourself, you haven\u2019t really lived through enough to be cautious. As someone with a pack-a-day habit, I got a little sick every year, and my response was to sleep (or work, or drink) through it until the issue somehow resolved. Before 2017 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d been to a doctor in about five years\u2014though as was later reiterated to me by one chagrined specialist after another, my abysmal life choices up to that point didn\u2019t end up making much of a difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither from feverishness or denial, the conviction that I was simply a little sick remained well past any logical point. I have health insurance now, but I\u2019ve spent portions of my life without it, and with my organs sputtering and a spiking fever I wasn\u2019t exactly thinking clearly. I thought of the friend stuck with thousands of dollars in bills, picked up by an ambulance after a bike accident. Call it a reflexive reaction to living in a country where one-third of the population delays medical care out of concern for the cost.\n\nAfter a weekend of still feeling off-kilter, I went to a clinic for cough syrup, which I quickly found I couldn\u2019t keep down. Two days later, sweaty and half out of my mind, I stumbled back to the same clinic. I\u2019d tried to brush my teeth and ended up spewing bile. The doctor didn\u2019t even examine me: \u201cThe only way you\u2019re leaving here is in an ambulance,\u201d she told me. She wanted to call the hospital: I protested, still of the opinion that a hospital visit would be too pricey. I called a friend, who called a car, and we drove to the closest ER.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sheer number of doctors involved in emergency medical care\u2014especially when the cause of illness is unknown\u2014can be staggering. Often, once a person is sick enough not to know what\u2019s going on, an army of costly specialists are called in. Doctors with the highest out-of-network markups are the ones patients are unlikely to choose themselves: pathologists, anesthesiologists, emergency medical doctors.\n\nI encountered them all when I was admitted to a Brooklyn hospital, though I only remember a fraction of the people who tried to puzzle out what was sending my body into septic shock. According to my medical records I saw six specialists in 40 hours. There was the anesthesiologist who assuaged my terror when I was put under for a bronchoscopy (I was afraid I\u2019d wake up with a camera down my larynx), the infectious disease doctors who asked me about my sex life, how often I got high, my last period, whether I\u2019d been anywhere near livestock.\n\n\n\nFor awhile the theory was that I had toxic shock; they poked around for a tampon, didn\u2019t find one. There was a mass near my lung, but it wasn\u2019t cancer, despite what one doctor seemed to think. I was put into quarantine and texted a friend, desperately cheerful: \u201cThey\u2019re treating me like a patient in world war Z right now.\u201d The joke was short-lived when I started playing scenes from those films in my head. I added: \u201cI\u2019m jusyrinf nor to panic everyone like I\u2019m dying lol.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was having an awful lot of trouble breathing. My liver and kidneys had begun to shut down, and I was informed something was off with a valve in my heart. My hands and feet turned bright red. The unspecified infection winding through my bloodstream was similar to one common with intravenous drug users, so I testified to a stone-faced doctor at length about the kinds of drugs I do, and how often, and how recently. I got the distinct sense he thought I was lying. He asked about my mental health, which I found odd.\n\nBut when I was finally released into a small private hospital room, I wondered if I could actually believe myself. The room\u2019s green carpet and green walls looked all wrong, oddly monochromatic: I thought maybe I was going crazy, maybe I had in fact taken drugs. I was suddenly very afraid to be alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I know about the next week is mostly pieced together from what I\u2019ve been told and what\u2019s listed on some of the 100-plus insurance claims filed on my behalf. At some point, my retired mother arrived, and I told her that while I was glad she was there, she didn\u2019t have to come: It wasn\u2019t like I was dying (an objectively false statement I have no recollection of making). My boyfriend called my boss and told her not to expect me back at work any time soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week ago, I had been a healthy person in her twenties drinking in a friend\u2019s new apartment in Fort Greene. Now doctors tried to give me updates on the tests they were doing and I couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, even as I could objectively sense how corroded my processing power had become. I spent months of my life at the mercy of people with the capacity\u2014and perhaps more importantly, the incentive\u2014to care for me.\n\nThe hospital consortium I was admitted to has declined, of course, to comment on what options patients have when they can\u2019t immediately cough up cash. My surgeon, a lovely man who appeared completely elated by my recovery\u2014and took a photo, before he operated, of the ping-pong-sized hole in my lung\u2014told me recently that while the surgery he performed on me was perhaps \u201cunusual,\u201d my health issue was \u201ccertainly high risk.\u201d He doesn\u2019t get involved in insurance-related issues, obviously; he has paper-pushers for that. \u201cWhat I do know,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cis that insurance can limit and make our lives difficult, as they commonly deny patients access and healthcare they deserve.\u201d\n\n\n\nSherry Glied, the dean of New York University\u2019s school of public service, put it a little more bluntly: Under even the lowest Affordable Care Act tier, she says, I\u2019d be paying the out-of-pocket maximum\u2014a little over $6,000\u2014and perhaps I\u2019d be limited to in-network doctors. (The hospital I visited has maintained a relationship with an Affordable Care Act-affiliated insurance provider since 2014.) But depending on an individual hospital\u2019s policy, and my credit score, and where I happened to land, whisking me to a second hospital with a dedicated lung surgeon to be treated by some of the country\u2019s best infectious disease doctors might have appeared to be more trouble than it was worth.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe surgeon at the second hospital told my mother I had maybe a 50-50 chance of surviving the surgery, but that if they didn\u2019t do it, I would certainly die. She signed all the paperwork and sent my boyfriend home and, though she\u2019s not a drinker, went directly to the bar, where she waited for the surgeons to remove a not-insignificant portion of my lung.\n\nAs they found when they tested the necrotic tissue removed from my chest cavity, I had contracted a relatively rare form of strep\u2014the septic shock shutting down my organs had been kicked off by a ravenous bacteria that incubated in my lung before bursting a hole clear through it. In topical manifestations, this form of strep is referred to by some journalists as the \u201cflesh-eating disease,\u201d feeding as it does on the fatty tissues right beneath the skin. In my case, it wormed its way into an organ and began to kill everything around it. The mortality rate for infections like these can be anywhere between 40 percent and 70 percent in adults. Many people lose limbs or parts of their face. Others require breathing machines or dialysis for the rest of their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the weeks that followed, medical residents\u2014all General Hospital-level attractive, to my great surprise\u2014clustered around with clipboards, asking hundreds of questions to place my illness and recovery within the continuum of their previous reports. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to understand how you got this,\u201d said one, after a 15-minute interrogation about my sex life. Months later, my infectious disease doctor, who wore a different pair of brogued leather shoes every time I saw him, would tell me with a half-smile it was actually probably just bad luck.\n\nTo compound the sheer sense of unreality and deeply unearned good fortune, I read a CDC study recently noting that for some reason, patients who contract similar kinds of severe strep infections are much likelier to survive during summer months.\n\nWhen I was woken up from an induced coma up a few days later\u2014about a week and a half after I\u2019d first gone home sick\u2014I couldn\u2019t understand what everyone was fucking crying about. I slowly discovered the humming tubes coming out of my nose and torso and bladder, mostly by way of hospital staff adjusting or emptying their contents. There was a whole bouquet of IVs in my neck. But my friends knew all about the machines I was hooked up to. They had complicated inside jokes about them I didn\u2019t understand, nicknames for (and crushes on) my ICU nurse.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecovering in a hospital like that, you only really do two things: try to follow directions that seem offensively simple until you try them, and hungrily anticipate the schedule of pain medications\u2014the latter of which were being injected directly into my bloodstream in icy spurts. People kept telling me to breathe into whatever contraption was attached to my face.\n\nI am lucky not for surviving the infection, but for being a member of a shrinking class of Americans whose lives can absorb a trauma of this magnitude.\n\nA few days in, I tried to watch cheerful TV shows provided by a friend, and found them too upsetting to stomach\u2014a side effect either of the fever or the drugs. How could Rick take such obvious pleasure in damaging Morty? What existential despair kept Michael Bluth with a family that so abused him? I watched one of the later Star Wars and I\u2019m so ashamed, but I cried. People visited me in shorts and tank tops, dripping wet, and complained about a New York high-summer humidity I could only vaguely place in my mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a lot of manpower seemingly required to staff my recovery, nurses gliding into the room and turning me over, checking my vitals every two hours. A chaplain in a floor-length floral skirt stalked into my room and asked me how I found meaning. (I told her, tragically, \u201cwork.\u201d She beamed.) When I couldn\u2019t finish the Ensure I was supposed to be chugging three times every day, one of the orderlies suggested I stash it and make smoothies when I got home\u2014after all, that stuff isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nOne of the most enduring cliches about illness\u2014that it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine yourself well\u2014is true. My sense of inertia had atrophied just as much as my muscles, and it took some time to realize, in the lethargic and infantilizing routine of the hospital, how much had been happening, elsewhere, on my behalf. The silent, softly lit medical center some 30 stories above street level was designed to feel insulated from the world\u2014the doctors positioned as if my care were their only concern\u2014but of course that wasn\u2019t true at all. By the time I left the ICU for a double room I had started to seriously worry about my job, another concern left over from my years of precarious work.\n\nThe paperwork had already been filed on my behalf: My paychecks were being delivered to my apartment, the doctor\u2019s statements had been forwarded to the insurance company and the state. My co-workers sent a very nice card. I was incredulous to find it had been signed by our CEO. Unsurprisingly, emergency time off that comes with some sort of paycheck is vastly more common in white-collar industries. New York State\u2019s short-term disability program paid about half of my salary; my employer paid the other.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt deserves to be said that while most everyone in the hospital I encountered was gentle and caring, and while my insurance paid for nearly everything, both institutions\u2014like all in the medical industry\u2014have in many other cases ruined people\u2019s lives. The medical center where I spent nearly a month was investigated a few years ago for taking charity money but refusing to give financial aid to low-income patients. My insurance provider has argued innumerable cases against claimants: They denied a $400,000 treatment for breast cancer this past November, just to name one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor reasons I will never fully understand, the occult transmissions between the doctors and the administrators and the insurance company left me responsible for $2,654.42 out of the $648,221.53 billed. And the paychecks I was getting came in handy for the copays and out-of-pocket costs, sure. But they also helped me weather what was essentially an extended convalescence.\n\nShortly after I was moved from the ICU, my boyfriend explained that my retired mother had canceled her foreseeable plans and would be staying with us indefinitely. I thought the two of them were out of their minds. But patiently my boyfriend, who was already struggling from taking (unpaid) time off, and who had sunk his own resources into preparing the apartment for my eventual return, told me what the doctors had been telling the two of them: For a month or two after I was discharged, I would have trouble walking and need to be monitored almost constantly for signs of a returning infection. Taking flights of stairs, cooking, lifting anything, even standing long enough to shower was for the moment out of the question. I would probably be in a lot of pain, with the incision in my back where they\u2019d scooped everything out. And three times a day, I\u2019d need to take a home-administered antibiotic through an IV drip that was impossible for me to rig up myself.\n\nOnce the IVs had blown through all the veins in my forearms and I could shuffle down the hall with some help, I went home. I was 25 pounds lighter. Outside for the first time all summer, I watched a woman amble down the street with a large suitcase and was in total awe, unable to imagine moving in such a casual way. I spent most of the next few weeks in bed; if no one was around to prop me up, I just lay there on my back. I had vivid, unsubtle dreams about all my friends growing bored with my lack of ambition. I couldn\u2019t even read for more than an hour or two without exhausting myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe PICC line, a semi-permanent IV that runs from the upper arm into the heart, pumping antibiotics into the blood, would have cost between $1,300 and $3,000 without insurance to surgically insert. A nurse came by my apartment twice a week to check it for signs of infection and change the dressing. She told me she was in a reggae band, in addition to being a \u201chealer.\u201d She spoke approvingly of the crystals my more superstitious friends had left around. The company she worked for billed my insurance provider just under $7,000 for services and supplies.\n\n\n\nAround mid-August they took the PICC line out. My white blood cell count went back to normal; I was cleared to drink by far the best beer of my life; the scabs left over from the drainage tube punctures in my torso fell off. I was pleased the surgical incision had missed my favorite tattoo, and less pleased when streaks of my hair turned gray and started coming out in clumps, or when my nails fell off\u2014a months-delayed reminder of that time my body was preparing to die. I went back to work towards the end of the summer. I gave consent to include my miraculous recovery in a medical journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI assume people think surviving illness changes you because there\u2019s something inherently character-building about pain. But what happened wasn\u2019t a struggle, in the sense that through perseverance I overcame something difficult. For a fairly brief but unexpected period of my life, I lost my capacity to work, to advocate for myself, to navigate life and all its frictions. For much of my illness\u2014intubated, drugged, feverish\u2014I simply wasn\u2019t there. In my absence, there were more than 25 individual doctors and specialists, an army of nurses, the friends who loved me enough to take care of my affairs while I was under, some unknowable number of insurance agents sitting behind desks in another state, silently placing checkmarks next to my claims.\n\nI am lucky not for surviving the infection, but for being a member of a shrinking class of Americans whose lives can absorb a trauma of this magnitude, and for whom being thrown, insensible, into the system is actually a good thing. When people refer to me as a \u201csurvivor,\u201d which they do often, they\u2019re correct, but it\u2019s not what they think it means: It has already been decided, especially now that it\u2019s again fashionable to claim that healthcare is not a right, who is a designated survivor in this country.

According to SFGate, doctors now want to expand the project in more cities across the country.\n\n\n\nUncontrolled high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of premature disability and death among black men. To make matters worse, distrust and discomfort around physicians and hospitals means that black men are less likely than black women to see a doctor. Getting beyond the hospital and into the community, then, is vital.\n\n\n\nAs Medical Xpress reports, the study included more than 300 black men recruited from 52 barbershops in the Los Angeles area, all of whom had blood pressure readings high enough to put them at high risk of heart attack and stroke. The site details how the trial was conducted:\n\nThe men were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group\u2019s barbers encouraged patrons to meet with specially trained pharmacists who met the men monthly in the barbershop\u2014where they prescribed blood pressure medication, monitored blood tests and then sent progress notes to each patron\u2019s primary care provider. In the second group, barbers encouraged their patrons to follow up with a primary care provider for treatment and make lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise and decreasing salt consumption.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial lasted a year. In at least one barbershop, California Healthline reports, a blood pressure machine was installed that sent patients\u2019 readings directly to their doctors or the visiting pharmacist.\n\nThe results were a \u201chome run,\u201d according to an independent medical expert interviewed by SFGate.\n\nBoth groups saw substantial blood pressure drops. When the study began, participants had a top pressure number that averaged 154 over 80 (130 or below is considered normal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter six months, men who just received advice and counsel from their barbers saw their blood pressure fall by 9 points. For those who had the extra support of the pharmacist in the shop, it fell by a whopping 27 points on average.\n\nBy the end of the study, two-thirds of the men who met with pharmacists in the barbershop lowered their blood pressure to 130. Meanwhile, 12 percent of the men who just received advice from their barber saw their blood pressure drop to normal levels.\n\nNaturally, The Root\u2019s senior barbershop correspondent, Michael Harriot, had some questions:\n\nHow are they going to take your blood pressure with that one badass kid running around?\n\nWill there be one pharmacist whom no one wants to go to because he fucked up your blood work last time?\n\nAre we sure we want medical information in the same place that spreads conspiracy theories like drinking through a straw can make you gay? (Harriot would also like to confirm that, yes, this is an actual conspiracy he\u2019s heard in a barbershop.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, how do you tip someone on blood work?\n\nAll jokes aside, the results of the barbershop study illuminate a new path in overcoming a long-standing (and well-earned) distrust among black Americans and physicians that has prevented some patients from receiving the care they need. This trust barrier makes it all the more difficult for black male patients to get the sort of sustained treatment that chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension require.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant effect for a hypertension trial of any kind,\u201d said Dr. Ronald G. Victor, associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and the study\u2019s lead author. Victor, too, suffers from high blood pressure, which was diagnosed by his barber in Dallas when he conducted his first study of this kind in the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Victor pointed out, hypertension requires a lifelong commitment to taking medications and changing one\u2019s lifestyle, and extra support and contact are necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is often challenging to get people who need blood pressure medication to take them, even as costs and side effects have gone down over the years. With this program, we have been able to overcome that barrier,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the trial lasted just a year, there are signs that its participants are carrying the study\u2019s lessons forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne barber who participated in the study, Corey Thomas, told California Healthline that he continues to talk to his customers about hypertension even though the study is over\u2014and the blood pressure machine in his shop is still available for anyone to use.\n\n\u201cA lot of us use the emergency room as doctors,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo I think [these] studies will help out a great deal.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["cutting", "pressure", "black", "blood", "place", "study", "key", "barbershop", "trial", "hypertension", "high", "men"], "polarity": 0.09416416468835824, "subjectivity": 0.46743832332542},

No one would be more in tune with how they\u2019re feeling, what feels a little off, what a certain type of discomfort and/or pain means, and what might need a certain test.\n\nBut it still took relentless requests for Williams\u2019 doctors and nurses to believe that she needed to be tested for blood clots and not just have her discomfort dismissed as a side effect from her pain medication. This, despite the fact that she has a history of clotting issues and literally almost died from it in 2003. And again, this is Serena fucking Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t know if Wiliams\u2019 doctors would have been more likely to believe her if she were a world-class athlete who also happened to be white. Or if she just happened to be an upper-class woman who also happened to be white. Or if she just happened to be white. Again, we don\u2019t know this.\n\nBut the distance here between what we know for certain and what I feel is minute. I feel like her doctors believed that they gave her the best treatment they could possibly provide. I feel like they definitely weren\u2019t actively thinking that since she\u2019s a black woman, they should be more skeptical about and dismissive of her pain.\n\n\n\nBut I know that black women receive different treatment for cancer than white women do. And that black women just generally receive poorer health care than white people and men do. And that black patients are more likely to have their pain dismissed by doctors and nurses, which subsequently means they\u2019re less likely to receive pain medication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that in America today exist monuments to James Marion Sims, a man known as the father of modern gynecology. And that Sims\u2019 medical advances were due to black female slaves, whom he experimented on without anesthesia because he either believed they didn\u2019t experience pain or just didn\u2019t give a shit about the pain they experienced. And that, just so you don\u2019t dismiss this as a relic from the past, in 2016 a study revealed that medical students still believed that blacks and whites experience pain differently.\n\nAnd with all of that knowledge, I feel like Williams\u2019 doctors may have subconsciously internalized those beliefs. And I feel like they may have been less likely to give her the benefit of the doubt without even realizing it. And these feelings remind me of how I feel about my mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mom\u2019s birthday is in a couple weeks. She would have been 65 years old. On her birthday I will call my dad and my sister, as I\u2019ve done with each of my mom\u2019s birthdays since she died in 2013, and maybe we\u2019ll talk about her. And maybe we won\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019ll just talk about my daughter or maybe my sister\u2019s grandkids or maybe Antonio Brown.\n\nIf the weather is nice, maybe we\u2019ll all drive out to her grave in Monroeville, Pa. And we\u2019ll stand around her plot, silently, not quite sure what\u2019s supposed to be done or said when you\u2019re standing over your mom\u2019s (or your wife\u2019s) long-dead body. We\u2019ll place flowers on her grave and perhaps pray together. And then we\u2019ll get back in our cars and drive back home.\n\nShe died in October of 2013 after a \u201cyearlong\u201d battle with lung cancer. \u201cYearlong\u201d is in quotation marks because while she was diagnosed in October of 2012, I believe that she was battling for longer than a year. I believe that if the doctors had taken her more seriously and had treated the paralyzing back and chest pain she\u2019d been suffering through since 2011 with whatever it is that doctors do to test for lung cancer instead of the Advil and Percocet and steroid injections they recommended she take, maybe it would have been found sooner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd maybe, if it was found sooner, they would have had a better chance of treating it. And maybe if she was an upper-class white woman instead of a working-class black woman who\u2019d just lost her house to foreclosure, she would have received different treatment. Maybe they would have found it sooner. Maybe she\u2019d still be alive. Maybe she still would have died, but maybe they would have discovered a way to manage her pain sooner so that her life wouldn\u2019t have been as excruciating.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t know if any of these things are true.

Tyson was tried and convicted in 1992. He was released in 1995, his six-year sentence cut in half because of good behavior.\n\nTo this day, Tyson continues to say that he was innocent of the crime. Here\u2019s what Washington said after Tyson\u2019s conviction:\n\nAmong Tyson\u2019s supporters was his billionaire friend Donald Trump, who actually attempted a scheme that would have prevented Tyson from going to prison after his conviction. At the time, Trump said he thought that Washington wanted Tyson\u2019s sexual attention and that Tyson was the actual victim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Tyson\u2019s release in 1995, a few months before the Million Man March, the newly converted Muslim boxer got a somewhat muted welcome-back rally in Harlem, the home of Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton and Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president\u2014and, back in the day, Malcolm\u2019s lawyer\u2014expressed public support for the former champ. Jill Nelson, a prominent New York-based writer and activist, was among the black female notables protesting this. It didn\u2019t help matters that Tyson turned down a request to speak to Nelson\u2019s anti-violence black women\u2019s group, choosing instead to shop. Boxing promoter Don King was happy about Tyson\u2019s redemption and return to the ring: He had a big fight lined up.\n\nSupport for Tyson then by many factions of the black community must be put in historical context, one that is relevant as black America continues to debate about Nate Parker.\n\nDuring the 1990s, prominent black men in the public eye were seen by many black (male) opinion-makers and activists to be under attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, who, as executive director of the NAACP, had upset many whites when he attempted to unify the radical and moderate wings of the black movement, got ousted in 1994 for privately agreeing to use NAACP funds to settle a lawsuit filed by a female staffer in which he had had an affair. Chavis, like Tyson, also did a hasty conversion to Islam after his fall\u2014but Iron Mike chose orthodox Islam, while Chavis chose to join the Nation of Islam, a base from which he attempted redemption by organizing the Million Man March. Chavis left the Nation a few years after.\n\n*Mel Reynolds, a black Chicago congressman, had to resign his office in 1995 after his indictment for being sexually involved with a 16-year-old girl. Convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault, solicitation of child pornography and obstruction of justice, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Ironically, this opened the door for Jesse Jackson Jr., who went to jail in 2013 for wire and mail fraud, to win Reynolds\u2019 seat.\n\n*And then there was the Rev. Henry Lyons, who in 1999 was kicked out of his top post at the National Baptist Convention for embezzling $4 million spent on mistresses and luxury items. The news came out when his understandably upset wife set fire to a house Lyons co-owned with one of his side honeys. He was convicted of grand theft and racketeering and also served prison time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*And do I have to mention O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson?\n\nNone of these cases are similar. But in the 1990s, black people on the street, in the black-newspaper press, and on local and national black-oriented talk radio were clear on how blacks\u2014particularly their most prominent, influential men\u2014had been historically smeared, so they reacted accordingly.\n\nNate Parker\u2019s guilt or innocence aside, a friend of mine pointed out the following to me while I was writing this: Isn\u2019t it interesting that Parker\u2014who, unlike Tyson, was acquitted\u2014is being portrayed as the black-rapist-of-white-girl of the original Birth of a Nation film? Rightly or wrongly, I keep thinking of this should-we-support-Parker\u2019s-film controversy as, ironically, the 21st-century version of the late-1960s furor over white novelist William Styron\u2019s fictionalized maligning of Nat Turner. Again a great anti-slavery hero is being tarnished in the public domain, obscuring Turner\u2019s braveheart contribution via white supremacy\u2019s fog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, Parker was supposed to fix all of this, not get caught up.\n\nBut history should never be used to excuse abuse by black men. Admittedly, this idea is\u2014and perhaps should be\u2014a hard sell in a country created by still-celebrated white male robbers and rapists.\n\nBlack youths, particularly black males, are constantly warned to avoid the traps set for them by white America and the police, its state agents. So at the risk of \u201cmansplaining,\u201d it\u2019s clearly past time to add male entitlement, including and especially sexual entitlement, to the Talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is new is that black women are no longer on the sidelines of these discussions, and black male abuses\u2014even ones seen to be historically exploited by whites trying to damage the black public sphere\u2014are no longer tolerated in 2016. *Cough*\u2014Bill Cosby\u2014*cough.* Sisters are tired of taking one for the red-black-and-green team when they have to constantly leave the field bloodied, sexually abused and humiliated. Now they speak out\u2014openly, directly and powerfully\u2014online and on campus. The web, not even fully developed when Desiree Washington was attacked by Tyson, continues to hold black Twitter\u2019s internationally seen explosions over Parker.\n\nMike Tyson\u2019s advantage is that no one ever expected anything significant from him, then or now. Parker is clearly a different story. With the incredible pressure the filmmaker is now under, he will have to do more, much more, than just issue a statement of semiapology\u2014well surpassing the minuscule and unsatisfying efforts of Chavis, Lyons, Reynolds and others of the dial-up-modem era.\n\nParker might have to enter into the public-arena ring, gloves on\u2014fighting not for himself or his historically explosive art, but for the history and current state of black people, for future young black men and black women who will one day soon, fairly or not, judge him and his work by what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

According to SFGate, doctors now want to expand the project in more cities across the country.\n\n\n\nUncontrolled high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of premature disability and death among black men. To make matters worse, distrust and discomfort around physicians and hospitals means that black men are less likely than black women to see a doctor. Getting beyond the hospital and into the community, then, is vital.\n\n\n\nAs Medical Xpress reports, the study included more than 300 black men recruited from 52 barbershops in the Los Angeles area, all of whom had blood pressure readings high enough to put them at high risk of heart attack and stroke. The site details how the trial was conducted:\n\nThe men were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group\u2019s barbers encouraged patrons to meet with specially trained pharmacists who met the men monthly in the barbershop\u2014where they prescribed blood pressure medication, monitored blood tests and then sent progress notes to each patron\u2019s primary care provider. In the second group, barbers encouraged their patrons to follow up with a primary care provider for treatment and make lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise and decreasing salt consumption.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial lasted a year. In at least one barbershop, California Healthline reports, a blood pressure machine was installed that sent patients\u2019 readings directly to their doctors or the visiting pharmacist.\n\nThe results were a \u201chome run,\u201d according to an independent medical expert interviewed by SFGate.\n\nBoth groups saw substantial blood pressure drops. When the study began, participants had a top pressure number that averaged 154 over 80 (130 or below is considered normal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter six months, men who just received advice and counsel from their barbers saw their blood pressure fall by 9 points. For those who had the extra support of the pharmacist in the shop, it fell by a whopping 27 points on average.\n\nBy the end of the study, two-thirds of the men who met with pharmacists in the barbershop lowered their blood pressure to 130. Meanwhile, 12 percent of the men who just received advice from their barber saw their blood pressure drop to normal levels.\n\nNaturally, The Root\u2019s senior barbershop correspondent, Michael Harriot, had some questions:\n\nHow are they going to take your blood pressure with that one badass kid running around?\n\nWill there be one pharmacist whom no one wants to go to because he fucked up your blood work last time?\n\nAre we sure we want medical information in the same place that spreads conspiracy theories like drinking through a straw can make you gay? (Harriot would also like to confirm that, yes, this is an actual conspiracy he\u2019s heard in a barbershop.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, how do you tip someone on blood work?\n\nAll jokes aside, the results of the barbershop study illuminate a new path in overcoming a long-standing (and well-earned) distrust among black Americans and physicians that has prevented some patients from receiving the care they need. This trust barrier makes it all the more difficult for black male patients to get the sort of sustained treatment that chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension require.\n\n\u201cThis is a very significant effect for a hypertension trial of any kind,\u201d said Dr. Ronald G. Victor, associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and the study\u2019s lead author. Victor, too, suffers from high blood pressure, which was diagnosed by his barber in Dallas when he conducted his first study of this kind in the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Victor pointed out, hypertension requires a lifelong commitment to taking medications and changing one\u2019s lifestyle, and extra support and contact are necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is often challenging to get people who need blood pressure medication to take them, even as costs and side effects have gone down over the years. With this program, we have been able to overcome that barrier,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the trial lasted just a year, there are signs that its participants are carrying the study\u2019s lessons forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne barber who participated in the study, Corey Thomas, told California Healthline that he continues to talk to his customers about hypertension even though the study is over\u2014and the blood pressure machine in his shop is still available for anyone to use.\n\n\u201cA lot of us use the emergency room as doctors,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo I think [these] studies will help out a great deal.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["cutting", "pressure", "black", "blood", "place", "study", "key", "barbershop", "trial", "hypertension", "high", "men"], "polarity": 0.09416416468835824, "subjectivity": 0.46743832332542},

Booker, hired in 1951 by Graham\u2019s father, Philip Graham, was the first black reporter at the Post, suffering the abuse that came with being a \u201cfirst\u201d in those days.\n\nBooker, who died Dec. 10 at age 99, \u201cintegrated an industry,\u201d Graham said. At the time, he said, citing scholars, there were no other African Americans working as journalists at major newspapers (though there had been); today there are thousands. There weren\u2019t even African Americans in other departments of the newspaper. Today both the man running the Post\u2019s pressroom and the woman who serves as his deputy are black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker \u201copened the door and thousands of others passed through it.\u201d\n\nThe icon later known as \u201cthe man from Jet\u201d would stay just two years. \u201c \u2018God knows, I tried to succeed at the Post,\u201d he would say later. \u201cI struggled so hard that friends thought I was dying, I looked so fatigued. After a year and a half, I had to give up. Trying to cover news in a city where even animal cemeteries were segregated overwhelmed me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1954, the legend-to-be joined the black-owned Johnson Publishing Co. to write for the weekly Jet and the monthly Ebony. \u201cBooker ventured into the South and sent back dispatches that reached black readers across the United States,\u201d as Emily Langer reported for the Post.\n\n\n\nFrom Monday\u2019s pulpit, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said that as he read Booker\u2019s dispatches, \u201cI felt liberated. I felt a whole world was opening up to me in rural Alabama.\u201d The civil rights hero noted, \u201cIt was dangerous to be a reporter with a pen and a camera,\u201d recalling that sometimes Booker would carry \u201ca Bible to look like a preacher or overalls to look like a sharecropper. . . .\n\n\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Booker, the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without wings,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker was best known for his coverage of the abduction and killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was visiting Money, Miss., from Chicago. Christopher D. Benson, who now teaches at Northwestern University, worked under Booker in the Washington Bureau of Johnson Publishing. He told of how closely Booker worked with Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, to publicize the atrocity visited upon the teenager.\n\nRelating those stories to today\u2019s headlines, Monsignor Raymond East chose \u201crolling way the stone\u201d as the theme of his homily, declaring the need for \u201crolling away the stone of lies and untruth.\u201d\n\nTaking this in was a crowd estimated at 400 or 500 in the cavernous Washington National Cathedral, which seats 2,400.

If the manager wants to hire an actual journalist, they\u2019ll be impressed. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the last person who held the position you are applying for, or if it\u2019s a new position, why was this position created? What happens to people who take entry-level jobs at that workplace? Do they get promoted internally or do they leave? What kind of career development opportunities are going to be available to you? Has that development been available to others, and if so, can you talk to them about it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just take their word for it. Will you be able to go to conferences and apply to trainings and workshops? Will they help you pitch your work to outside editors? If they tell you you can pursue these opportunities on your own time, or that you\u2019ll need to take vacation days for career development, that is a huge red flag. Keep your eyes peeled throughout the interview process. Are you going to be the \u2018only one?\u2019 What happened to the last \u2018only one?\u2019\n\n\u201cForget that you really need the job for a minute and take off your rose-colored glasses. The dynamics you see during the interview process will come back to haunt you if you take the job. Is the manager disorganized? How does the manager treat the receptionist? Does the manager make you feel comfortable? Write your impressions down at the end of the day and debrief with your mentors.

Simpson appears on the television screen, I wind up remembering that he is still alive. That after all he has gone through, O.J. is not yet at the point where white people are spitting and urinating on his grave.\n\nThe latest time this happened was just Friday, the day of Muhammad Ali\u2019s public memorial, when PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose show had a segment on the 10-hour, five-part documentary series O.J.: Made in America, which debuts tonight on ABC and continues next week on ESPN. It\u2019s the latest product of ESPN\u2019s popular 30 for 30 documentary series.\n\nThe early reviews are very positive, with thumbs-up blurbs galore: \u201cthe ultimate intersection of race, class and the city of Los Angeles\u201d; \u201cplenty of American reinvention and denial\u201d; \u201chow the criminal justice system and the court of public opinion actually work.\u201d\n\nMy memories of this period are pretty stark. Cable television had exploded from a 60-channel universe to a 100-channel one. CNN had new 24-hour competition in MSNBC, and more coming. Overseas television news bureaus were being cut, and television newsmagazines\u2014not sober, international investigative ones like CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, but ones dealing with sensational domestic issues, especially murder and mayhem\u2014began to proliferate.\n\nTV\u2019s new use of extensive, wall-to-wall coverage, heretofore used only during assassinations and attempted assassinations of U.S. presidents, was perfected during the 1991 Gulf War. That moneymaking momentum had to continue. So extensive and sensational coverage of lurid public events\u2014the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment hearings of 1991; the publicly exposed sexual exploits of 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton; the case of figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 and child-molestation charges against Michael Jackson the previous year\u2014had allowed cost-conscious television news to create a tabloid television culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then in June of 1994 came former football star, TV pitchman and movie actor O.J. Simpson. Accused of murdering his white, blond ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, Simpson was broadcast live on TV being chased by police in a white Bronco. The next 16 months of television were swallowed by what local and national television outlets were calling \u201cThe Trial of the Century.\u201d (My nickname for it back then was \u201cOthello.\u201d) Cable and local weekday non-network-affiliate TV programming was practically suspended during the weekday as the live feed kept the nation informed of every (mostly) boring minute.\n\nAmerica learned about O.J.\u2019s high-powered legal team, especially Robert Kardashian (the now-dead patriarch of the reality-TV clan) and a very well-dressed, very articulate black man named Johnnie Cochran.\n\nThe October 1995 verdict, O.J.\u2019s acquittal, created what was then called a \u201cwhite riot\u201d\u2014angry whites writing newspaper and magazine articles, late-night TV hosts joking about Simpson being a murderer for the next year, and Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing radio hosts exploding in popularity. (Much of black America saw a black lawyer achieving a victory over a white racist judicial system and a white racist Los Angeles Police Department.) This \u201cwhite riot\u201d over Simpson\u2014a politically and socially \u201ccolorless\u201d black man and the ultimate assimilator\u2014ironically fed the fire for black men to assemble for the first Million Man March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have tried very hard to forget this time. The period between the end of the Cold War and 9/11 had a ridiculous level of promise. It was largely squandered. The smoke from the 1992 Los Angeles disturbances still in the air, the culture became shallow while Clinton fought to get in and remain in office. Politically conscious rap got its lunch eaten by The Chronic, a herald for a coming decade of gangsta hip-hop music. It was the kind of period where recently freed Nelson Mandela was photographed with the Spice Girls. Wall Street was booming, and consumption and increased entertainment were in vogue.\n\nOne historian even said that it was the end of history, while an increasingly popular black scholar said that black America had developed a nihilistic streak. America\u2019s optimists were convinced that the entire planet was going to drive on the \u201cInformation superhighway\u201d (as it was then called), and a new realm of world social equality was, somehow, going to be born from that experience.\n\nO.J. stands at the center of the 1990s, essentially a frat-party decade for America\u2019s rulers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost-9/11 society has been less forgiving. Simpson, in jail since 2008 for robbery and kidnapping, has changed American 21st-century culture in fundamental ways. Forever parodied as \u201cJackie Chiles\u201d on never-ending Seinfeld reruns (the sitcom \u201cabout nothing\u201d being the quintessential 1990s product!), Cochran became a household name in black communities thanks to the O.J. trial, and the trusted brand of an injury law firm that was a fixture among weekday local TV commercials. Orange juice permanently lost its nickname. Murder trials covered live on cable television no longer have a special appeal. And professional black athletes are \u201cfree\u201d to be as misogynist and domestically violent as their sports leagues, the courts and the American public will allow.\n\nPost-O.J. culture is one without the illusion of innocence, and Simpson has gone from colorless to invisible. Like the recent FX docudrama miniseries The People v. O.J. Simpson, this forthcoming documentary series attempts to find him, huddled, in the white shadows.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

The site details how the trial was conducted:\n\nThe men were randomly assigned to two groups.

Unable to toss out the Affordable Care Act outright, Trump has instead opted to sabotage it.\n\nAfter signing an executive order Thursday morning that cripples Obamacare by loosening regulations on health plans, later that same afternoon, Trump dealt another blow to Americans seeking affordable, adequate care: cutting Obamacare subsidies for the poor.\n\nThe cost-sharing reduction payments Trump trashed are designed to help low-income Americans get health care. As NPR reports, without them, health insurance exchanges could spiral into chaos.\n\nFrom NPR:\n\nThat money particularly helps people earning between 100 percent and 250 percent of the poverty level pay for the insurance and health care that they get through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Ending the payments could cause premiums to spike, push insurers out of the marketplace, and even cost the government $2.3 billion more in 2018 than it would otherwise spend, according to one analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way out now is for Congress\u2014a group that has gotten perilously little done this year\u2014to push through legislation that would fund the subsidies.\n\nFor now, the White House\u2019s actions go beyond denying poor people health care, which Republicans have signaled for a long time they are happy to do. The executive order and the elimination of the subsidies are effectively a torpedo into the heart of Obamacare\u2014one that could sabotage the health care exchanges for good and drain billions of dollars of taxpayer money along the way.\n\nAs one health care policy expert told Splinter, the timing of this is deliberate, especially with ACA enrollment set to begin in two weeks. Chad Bolt, policy manager for health care at the activist organization Indivisible, told the news outlet, \u201cTrump is intentionally trying to create confusion so that people don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know if the ACA still exists, if they can still sign up,\u201d Bolt added.\n\nThe Trump administration has already slashed funding for ACA advertising and \u201cnavigators\u201d\u2014organizations that help Americans enroll in exchange health plans. Trump also shortened the enrollment period to just six weeks (it was originally 12), which includes planned shutdowns on all but one Sunday. The sum of these actions is clear: to make it as difficult as possible for Americans to get the health care they need.\n\nThe confusion the White House has sown guarantees that Americans looking for Obamacare will face high premiums and less choice\u2014the very things Trump hammered the ACA for doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMake no mistake: Pricing Americans out of health care and reducing their options (it\u2019s possible that no ACA options will be available in some marketplaces) will cost lives. And Trump is so intent on undoing every piece of Obama\u2019s legacy that he will sacrifice the blood of his own base, literally. As CNBC reports, the lion\u2019s share of health care subsidies Trump cut on Thursday go to people in states that voted for him.\n\nRead more at NPR and CNBC.", "keywords": ["poor", "subsidies", "americans", "care", "affordable", "white", "blood", "aca", "obamacare", "trump", "hands", "exchanges", "ends", "health", "trumps", "house"], "polarity": 0.07366161616161615, "subjectivity": 0.5948989898989898},

He claimed, \u201cI have not knowingly done anything to ... do that.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI made mistakes, there\u2019s no question. Some of them I tried to own very publicly,\u201d Politico reports. \u201cI think I could have probably had more facts at hand and been more articulate in describing the entirety of what that day was about.\u201d\n\nNah, son, but I hear you, though. Spicy was a liar\u2014a practiced liar, a malicious liar. He came in lying about the size of the president\u2019s inauguration crowd. He made statements that were easy to prove false, like Trump winning the most electoral votes of any Republican since Ronald Reagan. Or when he claimed that there were some 15 million people in the country illegally.\n\nYou can read most of Spicy Facts\u2019 lies here.\n\nBut his lies weren\u2019t only lies; they were dangerous and continued to fuel a false narrative that has led to the emboldening of white supremacy. But let\u2019s act like all of this never happened once Spicy leaves the administration, which he only left because he was upset that Anthony Scaramucci, aka Scaramucci Mane, was going to be his boss. So it isn\u2019t as if Spicy had a call to conscience, or that he just couldn\u2019t be a part of an administration that was spreading vile ideologies ad nauseam; he left because he got passed over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now Spicy is on his \u201cRevisionist Retelling of Mad Lies and Shit Tour,\u201d and I can\u2019t blame him. He\u2019s jobless, and we all know that when you\u2019re jobless, that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 starts getting fudged left and right. You try to play up that three-month work gap as \u201cbook research\u201d or \u201cPTA involvement.\u201d\n\nThe problem with Spicer is that I don\u2019t think you get to be the mouthpiece for hate and then completely redefine yourself once you\u2019re given the boot.\n\nMaybe this is the chameleon, transforming ability of whiteness. I\u2019ve only known the saying, \u201cTo be black means you have to be twice as better,\u201d but I never thought about the inverse, which would basically read, \u201cTo be white ... well, that\u2019s it; you\u2019ve won!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpicer told correspondent and weekend host Paula Faris that Trump never asked him to flat-out lie, but stumbled when asked to clear up why he refused to acknowledge that Trump\u2019s travel ban against Muslims was, in fact, a travel ban.\n\n\u201cI would definitely say that I wish we had been more consistent from the beginning in terms of the terms we would use and the goals we were trying to achieve,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSpicer also said that \u201cthere are things I did during my time there that I need to go out and correct, and I did that,\u201d Politico reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpicer added that he wouldn\u2019t be giving out a \u201cblanket apology\u201d for his tenure in the White House; and of course he took one more dig at the media, which, he claimed, \u201cthink that everything we did was wrong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me the levels at which whiteness is accepted. Spicer was not only a liar; he was an emphatic, prop-carrying, flag-waving, indignant spreader of hate. He was the mouthpiece for an administration that has made no bones about its willingness to flat-out lie. And in the end, when it has all gone to shit, Spicy Facts can still book appearances and re-create himself as a simple man who was just doing his job, which he admits he could have done better.\n\nExcept the only way he could have done this job better is not to be such a deplorable liar. But then, of course, he wouldn\u2019t have been hired, and he knows that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t embrace this lying-ass liar.

We played to a tie (we were playing to 2). One of my friends is in phenomenal shape; he\u2019s contemplating competing in USA Track & Field events. My other boy and I are both active parents who don\u2019t work out or exercise nearly as much as we should. In fact, I work out never, short of chasing my children up and down stairs\u2014an event unto itself.\n\n\n\nAs it stands, on this current crisp fall Tuesday, my arms and legs are sore. I can lift things and walk, but the tightness I feel in my legs is, well, embarrassing. It\u2019s similar to the feeling I had when playing basketball many moons ago with my woman\u2019s younger brothers.\n\nWhat\u2019s that feeling? It\u2019s the feeling of out-of-shapeness. I feel like a dodecahedron missing one of its sides. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I gave it my all AND I like dodecahedrons, but my breath was shorter than I needed it to be. I ran full speed when required; it\u2019s just that my full speed isn\u2019t really that speedy. I mean, I\u2019m sure I could beat lots of people\u2014I have a spritely nature\u2014but we\u2019re talking about America here, so I\u2019m stacking the deck a bit.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to turn this into another edition of the Old Age Chronicles. In fact, I did a search on old pieces, and there are quite a few pieces that speak to, um, life changes that both Damon and I have experienced in terms of older-age activities, though neither of us is even 40 yet.\n\nYet.\n\nYet I\u2019m pretty sure that game is going to stay tied. Listen, three days after playing what nobody would call the most intense game of TOUCH FOOTBALL, I should not be feeling tightness and soreness in my legs. I just shouldn\u2019t. Granted, it was the most strenuous activity I\u2019ve done in quite some time, and I almost never exercise and clearly need to get out there and do more of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad. I\u2019m 38 years young with three children, two of whom absolutely keep me on my toes. I need to be getting more active to prepare myself for the attempts I plan to make to ensure that I can beat my children at basketball until they\u2019re in their late teens, unless I LaVar Ball this life and turn my boys into basketball stars early on, in which case I hope they beat me on our television show. Which we\u2019ll get. Because stars.\n\nLiterally just now I tried to lift my leg to move it from under this table where I\u2019m working, and it took way longer than it should have. This is just troubling and terrible. Between my Apple Watch and my Fitbit, I was outchea getting it, knocking out all of my steps in the recommended intervals. I was doing it, and doing it, and doing it well. Turns out that doesn\u2019t mean much of shit.\n\nNow, while I\u2019m struggling with how out of shape I am and feeling a way about it, I also have to acknowledge that there\u2019s little to no chance\u2014we\u2019re talking a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u2014of me doing much about it. I try to get out and run. But I never quite make it. Or try that hard. Even in the middle of the day, I tell myself that I will go on jogs to keep my lungs open and operational. Then I, say, just listen to Fabolous\u2019 \u201cBreathe,\u201d a total banger, and feel like I\u2019ve done enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Sidenote: I had to really think about how to spell Fabolous\u2019 name.

Conversely, when I\u2019m trying to spell the word \u201cfabulous\u201d properly, I have to do the same to remind myself that the rapper-name way is NOT the correct way to spell it. I\u2019m not sure what any of this means, if anything, but hip-hop has affected my life.)\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in this as many of us ascend into that age where outside physical activity is more relived in story than actually participated in outdoors.

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate. If you live right, you can get up to two years of lasting effects from these treatments.", "keywords": ["laser", "live", "regular", "laserandpeel", "skin", "plastic", "henry", "redcarpet", "types", "using", "treatment", "doctor", "peel", "peels", "facetune", "life", "lasers", "surgery"], "polarity": 0.21186278368096553, "subjectivity": 0.43090318772136954},

He\u2019s not only a liar, but he\u2019s an Olympic-level liar who lied on a national stage and wasn\u2019t even good at lying.\n\n3. He\u2019s not a friend of the people; he was President Satan von Shitty Horns\u2019 first line of defense, and he was complicit in every evil deed.\n\n4. There\u2019s nothing jokey about defending arguably one of the most racist, xenophobic and deplorable men this country has ever known.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Spicer has no redeemable qualities, so please, white America, stop trying to redeem him.\n\nI think that covers all the bases, don\u2019t you?\n\nNow let\u2019s ponder how such a horrific figure has been allowed a second act. How does a man whose first true introduction into the American consciousness was a barefaced lie about the crowd size at the president\u2019s inauguration become the surprise guest at this year\u2019s Emmy Awards, only to make a joke about said lie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, he\u2019s white. And I don\u2019t mean that in an everything-comes-up-roses-for-white-men way. ... Naw, scratch that; I do. I don\u2019t know how else to explain the embrace of Sean Spicer\u2019s do-over other than with the fact that he is a white man.\n\nChris Rock once jokingly exclaimed that there was no white man in the audience who would switch places with him, and he\u2019s rich! He then imitated a one-legged white man\u2019s response: \u201cNah, I wanna ride this white thing out\u201d (NSFW).\n\n\n\nBecause whiteness affords Spicer some luxuries that aren\u2019t afforded to other races. He was the communications person and the first line of defense for President Petty von Tweets Too Much, and not only upheld the lies that came from this administration, but admonished the press that tried to get at the truth. Spicer was uninformed-, racist- and xenophobic-adjacent at best, and calculated and divisive at worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN attempts to explain Spicer\u2019s presence in a space where he shouldn\u2019t have been welcomed:\n\nWas Spicer \u201cin on the joke?\u201d Was he essentially admitting to lying to the American people from behind the White House podium? As the debate went on late Sunday night, Colbert was celebrating his first gig hosting the Emmys at a late-night party in Los Angeles. Spicer was there too, taking selfies with celebrities and gawkers. He seemed to revel in the attention. Spicer resigned from his job as White House press secretary in July and formally left the administration in August. Now he is hitting the speaker circuit, landing consulting gigs and looking for a potential TV commentator job. He will be a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics this fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an odd dynamic to see a liberal Hollywood crowd fully embracing this new \u201cfunny\u201d Spicer. Let\u2019s be clear about a few things: Spicer was never funny or even remotely humorous in his position as White House press secretary. He was mean and curt and all forms of an asshole. His position required it, and because it was demanded of him, he was willing to be that person. Now that he\u2019s out of the administration, he\u2019s attempting to reinvent himself as a kinder, gentler version of himself.\n\nBut I\u2019m ashamed at how quickly a reportedly incensed liberal white America is willing to embrace him. I\u2019m ashamed that the Sean Spicer who was reportedly super angry with Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Saturday Night Live impersonation of him now gets to act like none of that ever happened. And the deplorable Spicer gets to be the punch line for the new \u201cfunny\u201d Spicer.\n\nIn the words of the great Ed Lover, I say:", "keywords": ["stage", "facts", "crusade", "sean", "liberal", "white", "lie", "secretary", "funny", "spicer", "house", "hes", "providing", "line", "press", "historys", "spicy"], "polarity": 0.024200693374422187, "subjectivity": 0.4844761171032358},

My friend quickly observed how I only ate half of my burger and picked over my loaded baked potato. I shrugged.\n\n\u201cWell, you know I had weight-loss surgery a couple years ago,\u201d I said.\n\nI\u2019m not shy about telling people I had vertical sleeve gastrectomy surgery three years ago. I also advocate heavily for more women of color to consider it as an option. While millions of African-American women suffer from morbid obesity (and its attendant illnesses), we account for some of the fewest patients receiving this procedure.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, vertical sleeve gastrectomy surgery is a type of bariatric surgery that removes part of the stomach, restricting food intake. It\u2019s a minimally invasive procedure that reduces the stomach 80-85 percent, to about the size of a banana.\n\nA study by the Journal of Internal Medicine, \u201cObese African-American Women\u2019s Perspectives on Weight Loss and Bariatric Surgery,\u201d states that black women rarely choose bariatric surgery as an option for many reasons, including lack of time and resources such as private medical insurance, as well as cultural issues, like identifying with larger body sizes. Other participants were concerned that surgery would be perceived by others as too extreme or cause them to have a lack of control over their food choices.\n\nWhen I had VSG\u2014or \u201cgastric sleeve\u201d surgery\u2014the decision wasn\u2019t made lightly. I have always been an overweight person. I was the only child of a single mom and was 11 years old when I started gaining weight; McDonald\u2019s was a mainstay of my diet. I was also teased a lot in my youth, causing my self-esteem to take a beating during my formative years. Food became my primary source of comfort. By 11th grade, I weighed nearly 200 pounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not alone.\n\nDoctors assert that 75 percent of overeating is caused by emotions. Consuming \u201ccomfort foods\u201d can provide some relief from negative emotional states; however, emotional and binge eating ultimately lead to obesity, which then causes more depression and anxiety. It\u2019s a vicious circle, to say the least. There are indications that the myth of the \u201cstrong black woman\u201d has long contributed to the high rate of obesity among black women. Current estimates are that a shocking 82 percent of black women are overweight.\n\nLike most overweight people, I tried all kinds of ways to lose weight. I had some success with Weight Watchers, along with experimenting with various shakes, pills and even shots. I exercised (sometimes) and went on fasts. Still, my weight fluctuated at between 200 and 250 pounds for years. Eventually I topped out at 274 pounds. In addition to the visual effects of my obesity, I was plagued with back and knee pain and an overall sense of fatigue. I was also prediabetic and had just started taking medication to stave off the disease. It was then that I began to research surgical options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I was afraid, and a little ashamed. I wondered if people would think I was weak or lazy or that I had taken the easy way out. But most of all, I was desperate for change, so I did it anyway.\n\n\n\nDuring the first year after my sleeve surgery, my life changed dramatically. I\u2019d thought that I was prepared; I\u2019d read books, articles and joined online support groups. Still, nothing fully prepared me for life after surgery.\n\nA 2016 New York Times article explains that not only is the intestinal tract changed by any type of bariatric surgery, whether VSG or gastric bypass, but these changes also affect the more than 100 varieties of hormones regulated by the gut. These changes mean that tastes change\u2014like my cravings for a whole pan of brownies. Not only do bariatric patients eat less, we desire less food. So it\u2019s much easier to be satisfied after eating smaller portions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about all those warm fuzzy feelings I used to get from stuffing myself with chocolate or macaroni and cheese?\n\nWithout real work through therapy, many bariatric patients transfer their addictions. During my first two years after surgery, I found myself drinking alcohol more than I ever had prior, still chasing dopamine highs. According to the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, 15 percent of patients who drank in moderation saw an increase in their drinking habits after bariatric surgery. Doctors agree (and I echo) that psychotherapy is an important step prior to bariatric surgery. It\u2019s vital to uncover the reasons behind emotional eating and to treat them in order to achieve the best outcome and avoid the transference of addictions.\n\nIn the three years since my surgery, I have lost nearly 100 pounds. My body has ultimately \u201csettled in\u201d\u009d at about 185 pounds. At 5 feet 8\u009d, my weight loss is significant, and I navigate the world in a noticeably smaller body. I have given away nearly two-thirds of my clothing\u2014even my shoes are a half-size smaller. Where my fat was once a place to hide from the world, I now earn compliments on my figure. Bariatric surgery is an adjustment that affects more than just weight, but it has given me a better quality of life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBariatric surgery motivated me to address the source of my food issues through therapy and helped me develop tools to improve my life. I now get my dopamine highs from walking a few miles a day, and I am falling more and more in love with the woman in the mirror\u2014not just because of how I look, but because of how I feel.", "keywords": ["pounds", "fat", "weight", "food", "black", "patients", "transform", "helped", "women", "obesity", "bariatric", "sleeve", "life", "surgery"], "polarity": 0.07321789321789321, "subjectivity": 0.4976654354100006},

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her.

Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions.

Those men were tested and then sorted into two groups: 399 who had syphilis and another 201 who were not infected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe disease-free men were used as a control group, while the sick men were told only that they had \u201cbad blood,\u201d with the study\u2019s purpose hidden from them. They were even given pills and tonic to make them believe that they were being treated when they weren\u2019t. In the mid-1940s, when penicillin became the standard treatment for syphilis, doctors never provided the men with the lifesaving treatment.\n\nAs the Associated Press notes, the government went about its merry way, publishing reports on the study, including the findings that showed men with syphilis were dying at a faster rate than the uninfected. But it is unlikely that any of the men\u2014or their families\u2014knew what had actually happened until AP busted the story wide open on July 26, 1972.\n\nThe result was a lawsuit launched on behalf of the victims of the study, which led to a $9 million settlement on Aug. 28, 1975. Payments were given to the men and their descendants based on whether the men were infected or were part of the control group, and whether they were dead or alive. Living participants who were infected with syphilis got $37,500, and heirs of dead members of the control group got $5,000. Women and children who were infected with the disease were given lifetime medical and health benefits, and a handful survive to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the legal fallout is not quite over yet.\n\nAccording to AP, the settlement funds were used for decades to compensate study participants and more than 9,000 of their relatives. However, court workers were unable to track down some descendants, and yet others never responded to letters from the clerk\u2019s office, which had already allocated millions of dollars before the last recorded payment in 2008.\n\nIt is not clear how much money from the settlement is left over\u2014court officials won\u2019t say. However, documents indicate that most of it is interest earnings from money paid by the government decades ago. Civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the government for the Tuskegee study, said that he\u2019s heard it\u2019s less than $100,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome family members want the money to be used for additional funding for medical screenings for the families of the men in the study, while others want a memorial at an old hospital where the study was run at Tuskegee University in Macon County, Ala.\n\nAs AP notes, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson is currently considering a request filed by Gray in August to use the remaining money to fund the operation of the Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center, which is a combination museum and town welcome center that includes a display about the study.\n\nThe center is operated by a nonprofit organization headed by Gray and his daughter. The names of the men involved in the study are etched on the floor as a memorial. A judge had refused a similar request from Gray in 2004, according to the report, after the government claimed that it should get the money, according to records, AP reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, as the case remains in limbo, the families of the men continue to remember, grappling with the stigma of being linked to the experiment and also working to deepen the narrative.\n\nLille Tyson Head is one of those people. The 72-year-old chairs Voices of Our Fathers Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit formed in 2014 by relatives to tell the story of the victims of the experiment.\n\nHead\u2019s father, Freddie Lee Tyson, was one of those men, but also so much more.\n\n\u201cHe was a wise man, very gentle. He was a disciplined man. Active in the church, loved his family and his extended family,\u201d Head, who was one of eight children, recalled. \u201cHe was a good man. He had a sense of humor; he was a good dancer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Tyson displayed no outward symptoms, he was born with congenital syphilis that he inherited from his mother, Head told AP, which is how he became a part of the study. However, in the 1950s, Tyson quit after hearing that \u201csomething was wrong.\u201d\n\nHe still did not discover the truth behind the study until the rest of the country did, Head said. He remained unaffected by the disease despite years of being in the study\u2019s syphilitic group. His wife and children all ended up testing negative, but Tyson was reportedly still traumatized and fearful that the disease would show up somewhere in his family.\n\n\u201cAfter he found out about it, he had to live with it. That could bring a person down if he wasn\u2019t strong. He was angry and he was upset,\u201d Head explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyson died in 1988 at the age of 82 after an automobile accident. His memory, however, lives on in the foundation.\n\nA little under 20 years ago, the descendants of the men began to meet in private. This year, for the first time, the public was invited to a ceremony\u2014a \u201ccommunity day of healing\u201d attended by 110 descendants, friends, community members, public officials and others\u2014where the relatives lit candles in remembrance of the men. (The last man in the study died in 2004.)\n\n\u201cIt was important that the people of Macon County knew what the descendants were doing, and it gave them a chance to come out and be a part not only of the healing but also remembering of the men,\u201d Head said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe hopes that in the future, more descendants \u201cwill come out of the shadows and be a voice for their fathers and grandfathers.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Associated Press.", "keywords": ["descendants", "men", "legal", "lives", "ap", "medical", "money", "tyson", "study", "court", "fallout", "ended", "syphilis", "report", "tuskegee", "head", "federal"], "polarity": 0.034224001924001934, "subjectivity": 0.4273544973544974},

Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["real", "housewives", "priebus", "im", "scaramucci", "white", "scaramuccis", "yalls", "45", "house", "spicer", "turned", "chief", "man", "president", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

John Bel Edwards in June, in hopes of changing Louisiana\u2019s reputation as the most imprisoned state in the country.\n\n\n\nIt is the hope that the act will reduce the state\u2019s prison population by 10-12 percent and save some $262 million over the next 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Prator, it\u2019s all a waste.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the state of Louisiana is risking our safety for bragging rights and to save money,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Prator later would show his whole ass, showing that he really doesn\u2019t care about safety or bragging rights. He is concerned, it would seem, about saving money, but only in the form of cheap or free labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [prisoners] that you can work, the ones that can pick up trash, the work-release programs\u2014but guess what? Those are the ones that they\u2019re releasing!\u201d Prator fumed in a video clip tweeted out by Shaun King. \u201cIn addition to the bad ones \u2026 they\u2019re releasing some good ones that we use every day to wash cars, to change the oil in our cars, to cook in the kitchen, to do all that where we save money, well, they\u2019re going to let them out!\u201d\n\nWell, that wasn\u2019t subtle at all. Do tell us how you really feel, Steve.\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one fed up, because in surveying the video, I found this guy, who is clearly over it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel you, fam.\n\nAnyway, as KSLA notes, Prator gave out a list of 33 inmates who would be the first to be released on Nov. 1. Some of those on the list did not qualify for release until 2025, mind you, with charges ranging from possession with intent to distribute marijuana and aggravated flight to DWI and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Correction Secretary James Le Blanc told the news station that he wasn\u2019t sure where Prator was getting his information and facts, and cited inaccuracies in Prator\u2019s assessment of the act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s some opening of the gates and everybody\u2019s releasing here,\u201d Le Blanc said. \u201cThis is 1,400 inmates that are going to 21 different districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have all the respect in the world for Sheriff Prator. I just don\u2019t know if he really knows what the numbers look like,\u201d he added.\n\nLe Blanc told KSLA that after the first wave of 1,400 inmates are released, releases would taper down to about 30 a month, and once again, it would only affect nonviolent and non-sex offenders who qualify.\n\nAs for the 192 inmates who Prator said were going to be released from Caddo, well, Le Blanc said that as far as he knows, the act only releases 35 come November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can put people that need to be in these beds in.

In the case of brain health, we know that everyone who has a brain is at risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the greatest risk factors being aging and genetics.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that other risk factors may also result in declining brain health. The lack of a healthy diet increases the likelihood of chronic medical conditions like hypertension, obesity and diabetes, and these diseases increase the likelihood of cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\nNearly half (45 percent) of all Americans suffer from at least one chronic disease; and more than 1 in 4 Americans have multiple chronic conditions. For many of these health conditions, black people have higher risk factors, occurrences, morbidity and mortality rates than whites.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s population ages, we should stop viewing chronic disease as simply a normal part of growing older. Our environment influences our health. In my role as leader of the National Working Group on Food & Health Equity at the Food Trust, a nonprofit organization working to increase access to healthy and affordable foods, I\u2019m particularly interested in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities and focusing on understanding how other social factors intersect with food and influence our health.\n\n\n\nEvidence shows that a diet rich in vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, is associated with better health and a reduced rate of cognitive decline. Studies (pdf) also show that people who ate a Mediterranean diet (fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, fish and olive oil) had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, and a 48 percent lower risk of such impairment progressing to actual Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, the better the food a person eats, the lower his or her risk for diet-related chronic diseases and the increased likelihood for a healthy brain. And conversely, a diet consisting of unhealthy foods can be detrimental not only to our physical health but also to our cognitive health.\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an estimated 40 million Americans live in neighborhoods without easy access to fresh, affordable and nutritious food options. This problem impacts residents of both urban and rural and tribal areas\u2014especially those living in lower-income areas and communities of color.\n\n\n\nIn general, poorer areas and communities of color have fewer fruit and vegetable markets, leaving African-American and Hispanic people less likely than whites to eat fruits and vegetables each day. And, as a result, lower-income and African-American and Hispanic people have higher episodes of diet-related diseases such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Evidence is showing that if left unchecked, these diseases can also increase a person\u2019s risk of developing and increasing the progression of dementia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt every level\u2014local, regional, state and federal\u2014there are examples of community residents, business owners, advocates and policymakers coming together to find innovative solutions to strengthen access to healthy food. One program to support the development of fresh-food retail, Healthy Food Financing Initiatives (pdf), has a proven track record of helping to grow grocery stores and other healthy-food retail in underserved communities across the country while creating jobs and improving health.\n\n\n\nOrganizations like the Food Trust, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association have teamed up with local community groups across the nation to help advance policies that reduce health disparities and promote health equity through the Voices for Healthy Kids initiative. We are partnering with groups like the NAACP, Safe Routes to School National Partnership, MomsRising, Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Balm in Gilead and many others to tackle multiple social determinants of health because neighborhoods with access to healthy food and safe places for physical activity should be a right, not a privilege.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, there are a dozen states with active campaigns to create healthy-food finance initiatives. Please urge your elected officials to prioritize the issue of inequitable food access in low-income, underserved areas and adopt programs and policies that have been proved to bring fresh, healthy and affordable food to underserved neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one study demonstrates, produce consumption for African Americans increased by 32 percent when African Americans lived near a supermarket. Let\u2019s encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles and understand the connection between their physical health, brain health and overall well-being. And, at the same time, let\u2019s encourage our lawmakers to endorse smart public health policies like Healthy Food Finance Initiatives that give everyone the opportunity to access better food and lead a healthy life.\n\n\n\nDwayne Wharton is the director of external affairs with the Food Trust and a participant in the Allies for Reaching Community Health Equity Public Voices Fellowship with the OpEd Project.

In 2014, Gallagher used electric shocks to punish defendant Terry Lee Morris, on trial for soliciting a sexual performance from a 15-year-old-girl, when Morris refused to answer the judge\u2019s questions properly. In total, Gallagher shocked Morris three times, \u201csending thousands of volts coursing through his body,\u201d the Post reports. Each shock lasts about eight seconds and releases a 50,000-volt shock into the defendant\u2019s body.\n\nThe shocks so deeply scarred Morris that he refused to return for the remainder of his criminal trial. He also missed almost all of his sentencing hearing.\n\nNow the Texas 8th Court of Appeals in El Paso has thrown out Morris\u2019 conviction, finding that the shocks violated his constitutional rights. The ruling was made on Feb. 28 and was recently reported in the Texas Lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was coercing behavior in such a violent manner wrong, but because Morris was too scared to return to court after being shocked, that \u201ceffectively barred him from attending his own trial,\u201d reports the Post, which violated his Sixth Amendment rights to be present and confront witnesses during his trial.\n\nIn the court\u2019s opinion, Justice Yvonne T. Rodriguez wrote: \u201cWhile the trial court\u2019s frustration with an obstreperous defendant is understandable, the judge\u2019s disproportionate response is not. We do not believe that trial judges can use stun belts to enforce decorum.\n\n\u201cA stun belt is a device meant to ensure physical safety; it is not an operant conditioning collar meant to punish a defendant until he obeys a judge\u2019s whim,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis court cannot sit idly by and say nothing when a judge turns a court of law into a Skinner Box, electrocuting a defendant until he provides the judge with behavior he likes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post also gave a detailed description of the interactions that prompted Judge Gallagher to stun Morris in the first place. The punishment was sparked over a dispute during Morris\u2019 plea entry.\n\nThis is what happened after Gallagher asked Morris how he would like to plead, from the Post:\n\n\u201cSir, before I say that, I have the right to make a defense,\u201d Morris responded. He had recently filed a federal lawsuit against his defense attorney and against Gallagher, whom he wanted recused from the case. As Morris continued talking, Gallagher warned him to stop making \u201coutbursts.\u201d \u201cMr. Morris, I am giving you one warning,\u201d Gallagher said outside the presence of the jury, according to the appeals court. \u201cYou will not make any additional outbursts like that, because two things will happen. No. 1, I will either remove you from the courtroom or I will use the shock belt on you.\u201d \u201cAll right, sir,\u201d Morris said. The judge continued: \u201cNow, are you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cSir, I\u2019ve asked you to recuse yourself,\u201d said Morris. Gallagher asked again: \u201cAre you going to follow the rules?\u201d \u201cI have a lawsuit pending against you,\u201d responded Morris. \u201cHit him,\u201d Gallagher said to the bailiff. The bailiff pressed the button that shocks Morris, and then Gallagher asked him again whether he is going to behave. Morris told Gallagher he had a history of mental illness. \u201cHit him again,\u201d the judge ordered. Morris protested that he was being \u201ctortured\u201d just for seeking the recusal. Gallagher asked the bailiff, \u201cWould you hit him again?\u201d\n\nThe crime Morris was convicted of is certainly heinous\u2014there\u2019s no arguing that. But Morris, like everyone else, is due a fair trial. There are also other ways to punish someone like Morris for being uncooperative without having to resort to literally stunning them with electricity like a dog.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallagher\u2019s cruel punishment also prolongs the process for the victim and her family, who now have to go through a new trial now that Morris\u2019 conviction will be thrown out (a new trial has been ordered by the appellate court).\n\n\u201cNever before have we seen any behavior like this, nor do we hope to ever see such behavior again,\u201d Justice Rodriguez wrote in her decision, adding that the courts are obligated to speak out against such actions, \u201clest we allow practices like these to affront the very dignity of the proceedings we seek to protect and lead our courts to drift from justice into barbarism.\u201d\n\nGallagher, in case you were wondering, is still a judge, and declined to offer a comment to the Post on the story, citing judicial ethics.", "keywords": ["morris", "used", "cooperate", "judge", "asked", "force", "electric", "shocks", "court", "trial", "post", "stun", "shock", "defendant", "gallagher", "report", "texas"], "polarity": 0.0061431989063567925, "subjectivity": 0.5446001367053999},

Ryan was hit with theft charges after \u201ca misunderstanding with a school resource officer over a 65-cent carton of milk.\u201d\n\nThat incident, in which the middle schooler claimed that he had forgotten the carton of milk that came with his free lunch, ended with Ryan being suspended from school and receiving a summons to juvenile court.\n\nCarroll Foy, a Democrat from Prince William County, spoke with the NAACP last week about proposed legislation that would make it so that students are less likely to wind up in jail or in the courts. According to the Post, Foy said she plans to sponsor more than 10 criminal-justice reform bills this legislative session.\n\nThe proposed changes include a bill that would raise the threshold for grand larceny in Virginia from a theft of $200, one of the lowest in the country, to $1,000. The low threshold means that stealing a jacket or bicycle can land a student a felony charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoy explained that raising the threshold could protect kids who make poor choices from instantly becoming convicted felons.\n\n\u201cThe punishment should fit the crime,\u201d Foy said. \u201cFelonies should be reserved for some of the most egregious crimes in the commonwealth of Virginia, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore proposed bills include H.B. 445, which would do away with the requirement that principals report certain misdemeanor crimes to law enforcement. Ryan, the eighth-grader, was originally charged with a misdemeanor after the incident over the milk carton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, two more bills sponsored by other Virginia lawmakers would prevent preschools and elementary schools from suspending and expelling students up through the third grade unless it was for drug offenses, firearm offenses or certain criminal acts.\n\nIn 2015 the Center for Public Integrity found that Virginia referred nearly 16 students per 1,000 to police or the courts\u2014the highest such rate in the country. However, a follow-up study from Virginia Tech last year revealed that, of the students who were \u201creported\u201d to the police, only 14 percent actually ended up before a juvenile-intake officer.\n\nThe Virginia Tech study did confirm that students with disabilities were disproportionately more likely to be taken out of school (either through suspension or expulsion), as were black students. Black students make up slightly less than a quarter of Virginia\u2019s student population, yet make up nearly half of all referrals to juvenile courts from schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerard Lawson, an associate professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s School of Education who led the research, noted that a single suspension makes a high school graduation less likely, and \u201cinvolvement with the court system makes that less likely still.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe repercussions,\u201d Lawson said, \u201ccan be lifelong.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["virginia", "virginias", "proposed", "threshold", "students", "bills", "pipeline", "lawmakers", "school", "post", "schooltoprison", "ryan", "dismantle", "likely"], "polarity": 0.07128672745694024, "subjectivity": 0.4377051671732523},

Her eldest son, Lawrence Lacks, has come forth requesting compensation from Baltimore\u2019s Johns Hopkins University and possibly other institutions for the unauthorized use of the famous cells that prompted decades of medical advances.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Lawrence Lacks, who says he is the executor of of his mother\u2019s estate, says that an agreement between the National Institutes of Health and other family members regarding the use of his mother\u2019s cells is not valid. The agreement did not include compensation.\n\nThe cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks, then 31, at Johns Hopkins while Lacks was being treated for an aggressive form of cervical cancer. The cells, dubbed HeLa cells, were taken without Lacks\u2019 knowledge and consent and became the first to live outside the body in a glass tube. They are also the most widely used human cells in scientific research, as the Post notes, with vaccines, cancer treatments and in vitro fertilization, among several other techniques, deriving from the cells.\n\n\u201cMy mother would be so proud that her cells saved lives,\u201d Lawrence Lacks said in a statement, according to the Post. \u201cShe\u2019d be horrified that Johns Hopkins profited while her family to this day has no rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopkins responded in its own statement, emphasizing that when the cells were taken, there had been no established practice for informing or requiring permission from cell or tissue donors. There were also no regulations concerning the use of said cells in research:\n\nToday, Johns Hopkins and other medical research centers maintain strict patient-consent processes for tissue and cell donation. It is now standard practice to have an Institutional Review Board examine every research study involving human participants before it is allowed to begin. Johns Hopkins never patented HeLa cells, and therefore does not own the rights to the HeLa cell line. Johns Hopkins also did not sell or profit from the discovery or distribution of HeLa cells.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been more than three years since the NIH came to an agreement with some of Lacks\u2019 family, requiring scientists to get permission from the NIH before using Lacks\u2019 genetic blueprint. NIH-funded researchers also are required to use a database of Lacks\u2019 genome that can be accessed only through an application made to the agency. One of Lacks\u2019 grandsons and a great-granddaughter were appointed to a working group to help make decisions.\n\nHowever, Lawrence Lacks said that he didn\u2019t sign off on that agreement and that when he asked the NIH for more information, he was cut off from the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d Lacks, now 82, said. \u201cInstead of explaining it to me, they went three generations under me.\u201d\n\nLawrence Lacks, his son and his daughter-in-law are planning to file a lawsuit against Johns Hopkins soon, according to the Post. The group said that they had reached out to other lawyers in the past, but were told that the case had passed the statute of limitations.\n\nBut Francis Lanasa said that he would use a \u201ccontinuing tort\u201d argument to claim that John Hopkins continued to violate the \u201cpersonal rights, privacy and body parts\u201d of Henrietta Lacks over time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been living with this for years,\u201d Ron Lacks, Lawrence Lacks\u2019 son, said. \u201cIt is getting to the point where it is the principle of everything.\u201d\n\nThe family wants the cells to be owned by Henrietta Lacks\u2019 estate, saying that they would set up a foundation to allow everyone to benefit from the cells.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["lawrence", "unauthorized", "family", "compensation", "hela", "johns", "agreement", "seeks", "hopkins", "post", "henrietta", "cells", "lacks"], "polarity": 0.12183441558441557, "subjectivity": 0.400297619047619},

According to the Chronicle, the 36-year-old Brown later sued a slew of Harris County officials, including the DA\u2019s office, the prosecutor and the police officer who handled the murder case, accusing them of hiding and falsifying evidence against him and violating his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n\nThe new email, which came to light because of Brown\u2019s lawsuit, backs up his claims, showing that the prosecutor at the time, Dan Rizzo, was aware of evidence that could have exculpated Brown.\n\nSome necessary context: Brown was accused and convicted of killing a Houston police officer and a store clerk during a robbery at a check-cashing store. But Brown maintained that there was no way he could have done the crime because he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house at the time of the murders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he could prove that he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house, Brown said, because he had placed a call to her at work from her house phone at the time of the murders. But as the Chronicle reports, for years, officials claimed that they had no record of such a call.\n\nThat changed in 2014, when an investigator, Breck McDaniel, found phone records in his garage that supported Brown\u2019s alibi. The discovery was enough to overturn Brown\u2019s conviction. At the time, the Chronicle writes, the DA claimed that the phone records had simply been \u201cinadvertently misplaced.\u201d\n\nThe newly released email refutes that claim. A day after Brown\u2019s girlfriend testified before a grand jury that Brown had called her from her apartment, McDaniel wrote to then-prosecutor Rizzo about the phone records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cI was hoping that it would clearly refute Erica\u2019s claim that she received a call at work,\u201d McDaniel wrote, later continuing: \u201cBut, it looks like the call detail records from the apartment shows that the home phone dialed Erica\u2019s place of employment on Hartwick Street at about 8:30 a.m. and again at 10:08 a.m.\u201d\n\nRizzo didn\u2019t share the evidence with Brown\u2019s legal team or the jury\u2014a clear Brady violation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn light of the evidence, Brown\u2019s lawyers want the current Harris County DA, Ogg, to formally declare their client \u201cactually innocent\u201d\u2014a label that would allow Brown to get compensation from the state for his wrongful conviction.\n\nAfter his overturned sentence in 2015, Brown petitioned the state for nearly $2 million in compensation for the years he spent on death row, but the request was denied by state officials because he hadn\u2019t met the eligibility requirement, since Brown was never found \u201cactually innocent.\u201d\n\nThat phrase ended up pushing Brown to sue Harris County officials for their denial of his due process rights. The civil lawsuit has certainly borne fruit; without it, the email would never have come out, and the public wouldn\u2019t know not only that Brown was telling the truth the whole time, but also that the real criminals may actually be the Harris County DA\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVindication,\u201d tweeted Brian Stolarz, one of Brown\u2019s attorneys when he appealed his criminal case.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly now, after a civil lawsuit, does the whole truth finally come out,\u201d Stolarz added in a statement, according to the Chronicle. \u201cI am sickened and disheartened, but encouraged that Dewayne is vindicated and his long journey to justice is near the end.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["email", "death", "county", "man", "brown", "chronicle", "withheld", "row", "innocent", "phone", "harris", "prevented", "prosecutor", "browns", "officials", "report", "texas", "evidence", "landing"], "polarity": 0.08897649969078543, "subjectivity": 0.46915069057926184},

And it was black women who worked to shift the federal government by sending Doug Jones from Alabama to the Senate. And it was black women who founded the Black Lives Matter movement, the most recent and deeply powerful iteration in the ongoing fight against police and state-sponsored harm and death.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat down to talk with Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors and asha bandele, a senior director at the Drug Policy Alliance and the co-author of Khan-Cullors\u2019 memoir, When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir (St. Martin\u2019s Press), which will be published Jan. 16. The offering, while a personal narrative, nevertheless unpacks the complex policies and sheds light on the human cost of the drug war and mass incarceration, as well as its impact on families.\n\nWe discussed Erica, Venida, the erasure of black women\u2019s work and what we can do to not only stop the onslaught of hatred but also honor the work black women do by lifting up that work and by ensuring that each of us has the space to heal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: It\u2019s been a tough season. Losing Erica Garner was heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nPatrisse Khan-Cullors: It was. A true tragedy. And the terrible reality is that black women, after having to deal with not just the criminalization of ourselves and our family members, then we\u2019re put in the position to try to fight for justice for ourselves and our family members. And in that work, we receive too little support.\n\n\n\nI think for Erica we all collectively could have done more\u2014even as I know individually people did. But we live in a society that is built on the neglect of black women. And when I found out that she was put in a medically induced coma, I just kept praying for her to make it. I was so desperate for her to make it. Erica was me. She was just about every black woman that I had grown up with, lived with, the women who raised me.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica made the ultimate sacrifice; she lost her father and then she sacrificed herself. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for us as black people to be the martyrs anymore. Erica\u2019s death should not just be a wake-up call for black people but for this entire country. We deserve so much more than what we\u2019ve been given.\n\n\n\nasha bandele: Erica, someone I considered a mentee of mine, was the mother of two children. She did very brave work with Drug Policy Alliance and was a beautiful student. She was also someone who was deeply seeking to learn the history and how she could use her voice to speak for many others.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that we can\u2019t talk about Erica\u2014or Venida Browder, Kalief\u2019s mother\u2014without talking about the ways in which black mothers have been treated since our first mother was kidnapped and brought to this country. We\u2019ve never had a right to our motherhood. The U.S. has the highest maternity-mortality rate of any developed nation\u2014and that rate is driven by the death of black mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Erica survive a maternal-related illness? I don\u2019t know. But I do know that I am deeply troubled that I haven\u2019t seen a groundswell of all women raising a flag about Erica\u2014like they didn\u2019t raise the flag for Venida Browder. And what I know for sure is that, if we don\u2019t take care of the most harmed in our society, then we will never have the policies we need to make this world the one we need it to be. But for now, I am keeping Erica\u2019s children, little E.J. and Alyssa, in my heart, in my prayers.\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about Erica\u2014or Venida Browder, Kalief\u2019s mother\u2014without talking about the ways in which black mothers have been treated since our first mother was kidnapped and brought to this country. We\u2019ve never had a right to our motherhood. \u2014asha bandele\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I really appreciate that because for every black man or black woman who has been targeted, harmed or killed by the police, there are family members whose lives and been permanently disrupted. And so I also really appreciate the effort that you\u2019ve put forward, Patrisse, in sharing that truth about your own life in When They Call You a Terrorist, what do you hope that people will take away from your story?\n\n\n\nPKC: I didn\u2019t grow up hearing about young, black, queer women who are raised poor. I heard a lot about black men and what was being done to the sons and fathers in our community\u2014and I certainly witnessed it. Except for asha\u2019s book, The Prisoner\u2019s Wife, there was little about the women who cared for these men, who put their bodies on the line, who worked five to six jobs so that children were fed and money was on the books so when men were locked up, they could call home.\n\n\n\nAnd when I was approached about writing my story, I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think I had a story inside of me. Because oftentimes for black women, the role that has been relegated to us is to be the container for someone else\u2019s story. We\u2019re the partner, the extra in someone else\u2019s tale.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo to even think about me centering my story, frankly felt uncomfortable. But when I told asha about it, she just said, \u201cThey\u2019re right. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d And to hear that reflection from another black woman, [saying] \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d gave me the courage to tell my story.\n\nMy hope is that this offers a moment for other black women raised poor, other black women who have been the backbone of other communities, to be centralized in this larger conversation around state violence and mass incarceration. I want to tell queer black girls why they\u2019ve been through what they have, how to tell what they\u2019ve been through, why they\u2019ve been through it, and how to survive it. I want to reach a whole new group of allies.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a moment where 45 and Jeff Sessions are literally dragging us back into the Jim Crow era. We\u2019re living in a moment when, while the rest of the country is ready to end the drug war, this administration is hell-bent on continuing it. And so, I\u2019m hoping that this book is also an organizing tool. I hope it reminds people why we need to not just fight this current administration, but why we should fight any administration that would allow human beings to live their whole lives in cages.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: And I\u2019d only add this, Patrisse: Your story, your honesty, your courage, these will be a touchstone for others to heal, to restore, to stand up, to be the center of their own stories and dreams.\n\nTR: Patrisse, what do you see as a black woman, as an activist, as a person who is advocating for the equality of black lives? What do you think this moment means for issues of black feminism, black queer feminism and black activism in general?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPKC: Part of why this movement has been so attractive is because we centered black women and black queer people as a part of this larger discourse around white supremacy and anti-black racism. Growing up in the movement, it was really challenging because the conversation was always about black men and the lens was patriarchal. And when I wanted to talk about black women and queer people, there was obstruction. It was looked at as a distraction. And I think what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in this iteration of the broader black-liberation movement is a deep center around why black feminism is an integral part of saving black people.\n\n\n\nAlso, I think this current moment has allowed for a new type of leadership, which is less about a single charismatic leader and much more about looking at hundreds, thousands of black people, not just in the U.S. but around the globe, who are taking on local fights that have national implications. It has allowed for black women to not just be at the forefront of the movement, but to be at the forefront of radical politics.\n\nWithout Black Lives Matter, we wouldn\u2019t be able to have a Women\u2019s March. Without Black Lives Matter setting the precedent for how we fight, we wouldn\u2019t have so many people be in conversation around sexual assault and rape against the most marginalized people in the country. And so I think Black Lives Matter gave way for our movement to not just be intersectional, but to thrive and to grow and to evolve.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: And can you say more about the movement\u2019s spiritual center\u2014and your own healing?\n\n\n\nPKC: We\u2019ve been asked by many, \u201cWhy do you think Black Lives Matter didn\u2019t grow from the black church?\u201d And what I say is many of us were abandoned by the black church. Many of us were told not to bring our sexuality or our gender identity to the black church. So we formed a different kind of church. We formed a church with our unions and our bonds. We formed a church in the streets as many of us end up homeless.\n\n\n\nWe are a generation abandoned by our government, who were the targets of the drug war, who witnessed our families being torn apart and taken from us. We\u2019re a generation that witnessed the deindustrialization of our cities and our counties. And while our loved ones, our guardians, our parents were left with no jobs, they were also given no resources. And so, the texture of our movement often is a \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about anybody,\u201d right? And the idea of an authority, especially the authority of a church, is neither here nor there for us because those are the churches that abandoned us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of us were abandoned by the black church. Many of us were told not to bring our sexuality or our gender identity to the black church. So we formed a different kind of church. \u2014Patrisse Khan-Cullors\n\nBut I\u2019ve seen also some brilliant pastors rise up and challenge homophobia in the church, challenge this idea that black, queer and trans people can\u2019t be at the center. I think about Rev. Starsky Wilson in St. Louis, Pastor Michael McBride in the Bay Area; I think about Rev. Traci Blackmon in St. Louis. These are three prominent pastors who have completely opened up their arms and not just tolerated black, queer and trans people, but said that you are a gift here, you are honored here. And I think more of that leadership is happening. I think it\u2019s part of a culture shift.\n\nab: And, Deborah, I would also say that we are less bound to Christianity and patriarchal religions. I would say that the centering of the healing and restoration of spirit and community and body has been a religion\u2014even in the midst of all this pain. But, Patrisse, I don\u2019t want us to get out of this conversation without talking about some of the things that you do to try to stay centered.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPKC: You know, I\u2019d been in caring organizations, and as someone who battles with depression and lives with PTSD, the moments when I would have flare-ups, the response always was, \u201cOK, go ahead and go take care of yourself and then come back\u201d versus \u201cWe are an organization that has implemented ways that our membership, our staff, can be just who they are with us, holistically. They don\u2019t have to go off somewhere and come back to a movement that is not equipped to look pain in the face.\u201d\n\nI have a lot of gratitude for places like BOLD\u2014Black Organizers for Leadership and Dignity\u2014who have centered aromatics, generative somatics and the reliance on the empathic for black people so we can thrive. And, finally, I am grateful to my spiritual practice, Ifa, a traditional religion from Nigeria.\n\n\n\nWhat also calls us to heal is our practice in our work. We\u2019ve centered abolition, and in doing that, you can\u2019t just have a theory. You have to live it. And doing that allows me, in this hard moment, this often demoralizing moment, to remain grounded.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: Ase.\n\nWhen They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir is Cullors\u2019 and bandele\u2019s first written collaboration.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeborah Small is the founder and executive director of Break the Chains, a national nonprofit dedicated to ending the harm to communities of color caused by the drug war.\n\n\n\nPatrisse Khan-Cullors is the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement and an activist of 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nasha bandele is a senior director at the Drug Policy Alliance.", "keywords": ["bandele", "matter", "lives", "womens", "work", "queer", "patrisse", "black", "church", "blm", "movement", "think", "discussion", "moment", "khancullors", "cofounder", "women"], "polarity": 0.036462300601644855, "subjectivity": 0.4859914523848949},

In Rosepine, they love Jesus, Trump, troops and flags (both the Confederate and star-spangled variety).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people? Not so much.\n\nOn Friday, Sept. 29, the North Central Hurricanes of Lebeau, La., traveled 95 miles west to face the Rosepine Eagles football team. North Central is a small school whose student body is 74 percent black and 25 percent white, according to Public School Review\u2019s 2015 statistics (the latest available). By comparison, Rosepine High School is 86 percent white and only 6 percent black, Public School Review\u2019s 2015 stats show.\n\nAccording to a story in Pen Point News and The Root\u2019s reporting, when the mostly black North Central Eagles took the field against the majority-white Rosepine Eagles, at least one of North Central\u2019s African-American players had already decided to kneel during the playing of the national anthem to protest racial injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of North Central\u2019s students wrote on his Twitter account days before playing at Rosepine: \u201ceven myself being a young man i know about injustice that goes on in this country, which is why i # TakeTheKnee before every football game.\u201d\n\nThat student, away from home, playing against a majority-white town, watched the Rosepine players burst onto the field for homecoming carrying American flags, and as the Rosepine team played the national anthem, he stuck to his convictions and took a knee.\n\nThat did not sit well with the Rosepine crowd.\n\nMaybe I should mention how much the people of Rosepine love the flag, again. It\u2019s a little bit creepy. In researching this story, I checked out half the townspeople\u2019s social media and spoke to several people in Rosepine. I mean, it borders on pornographic. Is there such a thing as \u201cflagophiles\u201d? People who want to make sweet love to the Stars and Stripes? Seriously, y\u2019all, the way they talk about the flag, you\u2019d think it had titties or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the second half of the game, the student who took a knee said a referee told him to \u201cnot come back, nigger.\u201d He said he immediately went to the sidelines and informed his coach. One of the North Central parents in attendance said that after the game, people in the Rosepine crowd followed the team to the bus, hurling racial slurs, including \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cniggers,\u201d and throwing rocks at the bus as they drove off.\n\nAfter the game, one of the teenagers who knelt during the anthem wrote the following on Facebook:\n\n[I]n Rosepine, La i experienced racism first hand and it was from a referee, what i was told was to \u201cnot come back nigger\u201d only hearing about it, i never experienced that and didn\u2019t know what to even say, of course i informed my coach...but this right here is the reason why i kneel, because of this type of treatment to young African Americans, and what makes matters worst is that it\u2019s coming from someone who is supposed to \u201cofficiate\u201d the game we all love....and I\u2019ll continue to kneel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in the flag-crazy town of Rosepine, people seemed to be OK with how everything went. (Did I mention their love for the flag? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve stressed how much they really love the flag.

She says the warden explained that her son was playing basketball when he collapsed on the court.\n\nDabney says her first thought was that it couldn\u2019t have been her son. He\u2019d played basketball all his life.\n\n\u201cI thought they had to be mistaken,\u201d Dabney recalls. \u201cHe never, ever, ever had seizures, that\u2019s my son. He had eczema, that\u2019s it. He was a perfectly healthy young man who loved playing basketball and never in his life had a problem.\u201d\n\nMadden had been sentenced in California the year prior on a robbery charge. But he died after collapsing on the basketball court inside the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi, a private prison the state of California sends inmates to in an effort to reduce overcrowding in its own state-run prisons.\n\nDabney frantically began making calls to the prison to figure out what happened, and if they had the right person. Initially, she was told her son had been in good health and that he hadn\u2019t complained of any ailments in the weeks before he collapsed on the basketball court. Dabney says in the days after Madden\u2019s death, other inmates called her to express their condolences and outrage at what happened on the basketball court that day\u2014including an inmate from Los Angeles who told Dabney he had met her son years before outside of prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was very upset,\u201d Dabney says. \u201cHe was telling me that the doctors didn\u2019t come quick enough and they had no idea what they were doing.\u201d\n\nAnthony Robinson, another inmate incarcerated at the Tallahatchie prison where Madden passed away, wrote about the incident in an essay published in the San Francisco Bay View, a black newspaper that covers political issues, in February 2015:\n\nThe medical staff\u2019s response was so inadequate due to indifference and lack of training that after fumbling with their oxygen tanks and other equipment and finally arriving on the scene, they were not even equipped with the knowledge that during a seizure Tyrone had to be placed on his side so that he wouldn\u2019t swallow his tongue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and CoreCivic, the private prison company formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America that operates the Tallahatchie facility, say they can\u2019t comment on any specifics of Madden\u2019s medical history or the alleged slow emergency treatment that took place after he collapsed on the basketball court due to privacy considerations.\n\nThe Mississippi State Medical Examiner\u2019s office ruled Madden\u2019s cause of death as natural due to dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle condition that can result in restricted blood flow to the body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDabney questions the medical care at the facility, especially after she learned her son was prescribed two drugs that, according to the FDA, could interact with each other and increase the chance of heart failure. She still doesn\u2019t understand how her son who played basketball throughout his life ended up dying on a basketball court, just eight days after his 30th birthday.\n\nThe answers may lie in new data obtained by Christopher Petrella, a lecturer in American Cultural Studies at Bates College, who found medical staffing at CoreCivic facilities he studied fall well below staffing thresholds in public facilities with similar population profiles.\n\nThe annual cost of imprisoning a California state inmate is expected to reach $75,560 this year, according to an analysis of the state budget by the Los Angeles Times. But the inmates in contract-prisons may not be seeing the same quality of care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA review of documents obtained by Fusion shows that despite similar population profiles, state-run facilities average about one nurse for every 30 prisoners while the contracted CoreCivic facilities have one nurse for every 90, according to Petrella\u2019s research. Other documents reviewed by Fusion from 2015 show three of the four contract prisons had vacancies for critical roles they were contractually obligated to hire, like a physician and registered nurses.\n\nThese documents are usually kept under wraps. While researchers and journalists can often access staffing and operation details from federal and state-run prisons through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, the private prisons companies are tight-lipped about for-profit facilities. The nation\u2019s private prison corporations are not mandated to answer FOIA requests, so this type of data is rarely made public.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPetrella says he is not aware of anyone else who has been able to obtain the medical staffing data at California\u2019s publicly-run prisons and the private prison they contract. This is the first time this data has been made readily available to the public.\n\nThe details of Madden\u2019s case remain fuzzy, and his mother may never find out exactly what happened. But the data, Petrella says, \u201cstrongly suggest CoreCivic does not provide health-related services equivalent to those of public prisons.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks following her son\u2019s death, Dabney says, things only got more bizarre. To this day, she has never seen an autopsy report. She also says she left voicemails for CDCR staff requesting a coroner\u2019s report shortly after her son\u2019s funeral but no one returned her calls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey kept on telling me the person I needed to talk to was never around,\u201d Dabney explains.\n\nA CDCR spokesperson says she could not confirm whether the office has received calls or complaints without more detailed information on who Dabney called. Dabney would have had to call the Office of the Medical Examiner in Mississippi to get a copy of the autopsy report, but no one ever told her that. She was trying to get answers from the people who sent her son to Mississippi in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Madden died, Dabney says someone called from the prison to say her son had \u201cepileptic seizures since childhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never had a seizure in his life,\u201d Dabney says. \u201cI\u2019m his mother. I would know.\u201d\n\nWhen she got a bag full of her son\u2019s belongings, she found two prescription drug containers. One contained ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fevers and treat minor aches and pains. The prescription was for 600 mg, a dose three times the dose sold over the counter as Advil. The other container had 500 milligram tablets of naproxen, another prescription-strength version of the over-the-counter NSAID Aleve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration officials in 2015 strengthened warning labels on NSAID drugs, alerting consumers about the dangers of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cBe careful not to take more than one product that contains an NSAID at a time,\u201d Karen M. Mahoney, deputy director of FDA\u2019s Division of Nonprescription Drug Products, said in a statement issued at the time.\n\nJudy Racoosin, the deputy director of FDA\u2019s Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products, also warned in the announcement that \u201cthere is no period of use shown to be without risk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain classes of NSAIDs also include seizures in the list of known side effects. The Epilepsy Foundation includes both ibuprofen and naproxen in a list of drugs reported to induce seizures.\n\nDabney says she went online and started searching for more information about the prescriptions as soon as she got the bottles.\n\n\u201cHe had an enlarged heart, they told me, whatever that means. But they left out that they were giving him these two types of medication,\u201d Dabney says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen the pills came, that just confirmed everything for me,\u201d she adds. She\u2019s convinced the drugs led to her son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThis type of egregious behavior is unacceptable and raises cause for concern.\u201d \u2014from the auditors\u2019 report\n\nCDCR press secretary Vicky Waters says she cannot comment on drugs prescribed to inmates due to medical privacy laws. But she says there are some \u201cmedications that the prescriber believes can be safely administered by the patient to self,\u201d which means inmates sometimes maintain and administer their own drugs under a policy called \u201cKeep-on-Person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA CoreCivic spokesperson says that \u201cwhile we can\u2019t speak to this individual\u2019s case, ibuprofen and naproxen are common NSAIDs that are found in many over-the-counter medications.\u201d The spokesperson, however, did not comment on the dosage or what instructions Madden had received about taking the drugs.\n\nJonathan Burns, director of public affairs for CoreCivic, says Petrella is not an objective academic researcher because he also sits on the Board of Directors of Grassroots Leadership, an advocacy group whose mission is \u201cto abolish for-profit private prisons, jails, and detention centers.\u201d\n\nBut a 2015 audit conducted by CDCR\u2019s own California Correctional Health Care Services department found the Tallahatchie facility was \u201cstruggling to provide adequate health care to CDCR inmate-patients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same department found that three of the four contract facilities were contractually understaffed.\n\nThe Tallahatchie facility audit, which was conducted in 2015 and not related to Madden\u2019s death, also found that only three of eight exam rooms inspected during the onsite audit had the proper equipment. Some exam rooms were missing common medical devices and the audit noted only one out of four nurses was seen disinfecting medical equipment after each patient use.\n\n\n\nThe report concluded that the \u201caccess and quality of medical care provided to the CDCR inmate-patient population at [Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility] is undesirable and not meeting the target performance benchmark of 85.0% compliance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCDCR audits and requirements have changed over the past few years, and [CoreCivic] has been working diligently to adjust our services to these new standards,\u201d CoreCivic says.\n\nAt the Florence Correctional Center in Arizona, CDCR auditors found there were fewer nurses than the facility was contractually obligated to have and that it \u201cfalsified the meeting minutes by stating that all medical responses took place in less than four minutes,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThis type of egregious behavior is unacceptable and raises cause for concern,\u201d the auditors\u2019 report continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCDCR no longer contracts use of Florence Correctional Center. The facility now detains inmates for the U.S. Marshals and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nCDCR press secretary Vicky Waters says \u201cwe have worked on numerous reforms to ensure quality of care is delivered to inmates. If there are deficiencies, we work with the California Correctional Health Care Services to identify and address them.\u201d\n\nThe California inmates in private prisons with fewer nurses are also more likely to be black and Latino. People of color comprise 89% of those incarcerated in CoreCivic-owned and -operated facilities housing California state prisoners, according to Petrella\u2019s research. By contrast, inmates of color comprised 76% of those being detained in California state-run public facilities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCoreCivic writes contracts to incarcerate younger prisoners, because presumably younger prisoners are a lot healthier, and statistically younger prisoners tend to be people of color,\u201d Petrella says.\n\nThe office of California Correctional Health Services admitted in a memo sent to Petrella that there is a disparity in medical staffing between public and private prisons, but that \u201cstaffing ratios are based on patient acuity and health care needs,\u201d and \u201cout of state inmates are the healthiest of California inmates and their nurse-to-patient ratio reflects that fact.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Burns, director of public affairs for CoreCivic, emailed Fusion a statement: \u201cCDCR provides medical care for higher-acuity and medically complex or fragile inmates at its in-state facilities...CDCR\u2019s agreement with CCA requires inmates who become seriously ill while in a CCA facility to be returned to the state. As with all of our contracts with state government partners, the state, not CCA, determines which inmates are housed at CCA facilities.\u201d\n\nAs for Dabney, she wasn\u2019t aware her son was detained in a for-profit private prison until Fusion called her for comment on this story. She says if she had the money she would sue the state of California and CoreCivic for medical neglect. She still keeps her son\u2019s belongings in the same bag just in case she can someday afford a lawyer. She says she was confused when she saw that the bag included her son\u2019s clothes soaked in urine. \u201cBut then the Lord said to me, \u2018This is evidence to prove what happened to your son,\u2019\u201d Dabney says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe still asks herself if her son would still be alive if he had never gone to prison\u2014especially a private one.\n\n\u201cMy son was nice, strong, and young and they shipped him off,\u201d Dabney says. \u201cIt\u2019s just profit for them, they don\u2019t care about lives.\u201d", "keywords": ["prison", "dead", "corners", "corecivic", "facility", "dabney", "care", "madden", "medical", "son", "california", "private", "state", "tyrone", "inmates", "cut"], "polarity": 0.06013657703798552, "subjectivity": 0.34406972135845393},

As the Sacramento Bee defines it, personal recognizance bond \u201callows defendants be released from jail before standing trial without having to pay cash bail.\u201d\n\nMcSpadden also made it very clear to whom he was denying bail. From the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cThe young black men - and it\u2019s primarily young black men rather than young black women - charged with felony offenses, they\u2019re not getting good advice from their parents,\u201d he said. \u201cWho do they get advice from? Rag-tag organizations like Black Lives Matter, which tell you, \u2018Resist police,\u2019 which is the worst thing in the world you could tell a young black man ... They teach contempt for the police, for the whole justice system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden also referred to these defendants as \u201ctainted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody we see here has been tainted in some way before we see them,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey\u2019re not good risks.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday (h/t to the Sacramento Bee), the state\u2019s ACLU chapter called McSpadden\u2019s comments an open admission of racial bias against young black male defendants who appeared before the judge in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there remained any doubt that the deck is stacked against people of color in our criminal justice system, Michael McSpadden just dispelled it,\u201d Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said in the statement.\n\nThe comments, along with the revelation that McSpadden barred magistrates from offering personal bond for years, add to the judge\u2019s troubled history of stripping defendants of their rights.\n\nIn July, McSpadden made headlines after a Houston city councilman accused the felony-court judge of judicial oppression. As the Houston Chronicle reported, Councilman Michael Kubosh, who is also a bail bondsman, said that McSpadden refused to appoint lawyers to low-income clients who were free on bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden\u2019s policy was to require most defendants free on bail to hire their own lawyer. If they did not, he ordered them to come to court daily until a lawyer was hired. McSpadden\u2019s rationale was cartoonishly simple: If you can make bail, you can afford a lawyer; underprivileged clients who asked for court-appointed attorneys were regularly denied them by McSpadden.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be this hard,\u201d Kubosh told the Chronicle at the time. \u201cThey do this to oppress the person to take a plea or give up and just make a deal.

He has spent more than 50 Christmases there, but he thought this year might be different. The parole board was set to hear his case for release, but on the day of the hearing, the board delayed it.\n\nIn 1963, when John F. Kennedy was president, a judge sentenced the then 17-year-old Montgomery to life without parole. America is the only place in the world where prosecutors regularly try kids as adults and request that kids be sentenced to die behind bars with no hope of freedom.\n\nBut Montgomery now has a second chance, thanks to a string of rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012 the Supreme Court recognized that kids are different from adults. They have underdeveloped brains, impairing judgment and impulse control, and are more susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure. Unsurprisingly, those who make their way into the criminal-justice system are often themselves victims (pdf) of physical abuse, sexual abuse, extreme poverty and trauma at elevated levels.\n\nBecause of these differences, the Supreme Court eliminated life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than murder, and severely limited it for kids charged with murder, ruling that only the \u201cirreparably corrupt\u201d can receive a juvenile life-without-parole sentence. And in 2016, in Henry Montgomery\u2019s appeal, the court made that decision retroactive.\n\nMontgomery is now one of the more than 2,100 \u201cjuvenile lifers\u201d in America\u2019s prisons waiting to plead their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the sentence prevails, especially in Michigan\u2014where we\u2019ve all lived and either played sports or coached. While 19 states and the District of Columbia have formally eliminated juvenile life without parole, and while prosecutors in most states almost never seek it, district attorneys in Michigan, Louisiana and a few isolated pockets are leading the charge to keep kids behind bars. Forever.\n\nTake Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. As of July of 2016 (pdf), Wayne County had more than 150 people with juvenile life-without-parole sentences\u2014the second highest in the country. Ninety percent of those kids are black, even though black people make up just 39 percent of the population. The elected prosecutor, Kym Worthy, has pushed to maintain the original life sentence in nearly 40 percent of cases of juvenile life without parole, even though the Supreme Court has said that only the rare kid should qualify. Jessica Cooper, the elected prosecutor in nearby Oakland County, Mich., is asking for death behind bars in almost 90 percent of the proceedings.\n\nDuring our recent Detroit listen-and-learn tour focused on juvenile justice, several of us heard moving stories about those juvenile lifers who have now been given a second chance. We met Edward Sanders, who at 17 was sentenced to life without parole for participating in a drive-by shooting even though he was not the shooter. His accomplishments behind bars are remarkable. He served on a Michigan committee to help improve relations between prison staff and inmates. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree, took a paralegal course and served as a resident jailhouse lawyer, helping other inmates with their pleadings. He even taught classes. And in July of this year, after more than 40 years in prison, he was resentenced and paroled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are hundreds of people like Sanders who are no longer a danger to society and have something to contribute. Like Sanders, they should be given an opportunity to show they have changed and earn their release.\n\nWhen prosecutors like those in Michigan ask to maintain juvenile life-without-parole sentences, they are saying that people who received lengthy sentences as kids should not have the opportunity to plead their cases to a parole board even after serving decades for their crimes\u2014no matter how changed or how successful they have been in classes or programs. That\u2019s a startling claim to make about a kid who committed a crime before he or she could vote, order a drink, join the military or, for some, drive a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese prosecutors are simply refusing to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. That should change. They should let individuals convicted as children plead their cases to a parole board after spending decades in prison, exercising empathy instead of relying on overly harsh juvenile sentences. State legislators can also pass legislation to end juvenile life without parole. We place trust in our elected officials to follow the law and do the right thing, but they are failing us. We call on our elected leaders to stop betraying the public trust and to end juvenile life without parole forever.\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nStan Van Gundy is head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

Gen. Jay Silveria, rattled off a statement to the press:\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, the area of dignity and respect is my red line. Let me be clear: it won\u2019t be crossed without significant repercussions. Diversity is a strength of our academy and our Air Force. We are stronger when we take into account the views of those with different backgrounds and life experiences.\n\nThe students are part of a 10-month program to help them acclimate to life at the Air Force Academy, so, in a twisted sort of way, this is part of their training. While their parents have expressed concern and an investigation has been launched, none of that will change one basic fact: The U.S. military has a long, sordid, racist and violent history when it comes to the treatment of black soldiers. While this may be the first, this certainly won\u2019t be the last, or worst, racial treatment these young people will receive should they choose to serve in the U.S. military.\n\nFor his part, Silveria followed up by dragging the entire academy into an assembly to inform the attendees of what had happened at the prep school and to make it clear that the behavior was not acceptable.\n\nHe contextualized the attack on the future cadets with the events of Charlottesville, Va., and Ferguson, Mo., and even the NFL protests against racial injustice. He repeated, for the entire class and the cameras, \u201cIf you can\u2019t treat someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.\u201d\n\nAs responses go\u2014given that Silveria has just seen evidence that there are people at the institution who want to dehumanize and terrorize fellow or future cadets\u2014\u201cYou need to get out\u201d is a pretty weak response. It\u2019s a call for removing a \u201cproblem\u201d as opposed to eradicating it. It\u2019s akin to finding out there\u2019s a serial rapist on campus and saying, \u201cThis campus has no place for rapists; they must go!\u201d Thanks, but maybe you should prosecute them, too?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in and around the military my entire life. I have immediate family who have served in and retired from multiple branches, and I have close friends who are deployed overseas.\n\nWhen I was a kid, A Soldier\u2019s Story and The Lords of Discipline, movies about the grotesque violence and racism faced by men of color integrating the armed forces, were regularly in my family\u2019s VCR. I remember seeing white soldiers smirking or simply refusing to salute my father as we walked around the base on which I grew up.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten late-night phone calls from friends deployed overseas asking for advice on how to deal with racialized and sexual violence from fellow soldiers. I\u2019ve heard the sick racial-hazing stories from campus ROTC programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, compared with the scale of racial dreck these young people of the Air Force Academy Prep School are likely to face if they choose a career in the military, Silveria\u2019s generalized admonishment will leave them woefully unprepared.\n\nConservatives of all colors like to point to the military as one of the most integrated and racially harmonious parts of American society, which is fine if you\u2019re talking about the Salvation Army or GI Joe. The actual military? Not so much.\n\nBlack soldiers, whether in training or veterans, have been routinely targeted throughout American history for a special kind of violence as white supremacy quivers at the notion of black people being armed, trained and capable of arming themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why black veterans were consistently denied the benefits of the GI Bill that built the American middle class. That\u2019s why the lynching of black soldiers has been so common throughout U.S. history. That\u2019s why Richard Collins III, a recently commissioned officer two weeks from graduating college this spring, was killed by a white nationalist while the current U.S. president barely said a peep.\n\nThat\u2019s why, despite African-American women making up more than 40 percent of all women in the armed forces, it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that President Barack Obama was able to change racially biased hair standards for active-duty women of color.\n\nThat\u2019s why a group of West Point cadets showing racial and American pride caused a firestorm last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just examples of how the American military to this day treats people of color, and it continues to do a number on white Americans, too.\n\nAs far back as 2008, military analysts were warning that white nationalist groups were trying to enlist members of the military for free, tax-funded training for a coming \u201crace war.\u201d White nationalist groups regularly recruit from the military, and many branches have done an inadequate job of expelling members who advocate violence against black people.\n\nDillon Ulysses Hopper, leader of the Vanguard America white nationalist group that was part of the Charlottesville terrorist attack, was a recruiter for the Marine Corps until just a few months before the march in Virginia, despite openly calling for violence against nonwhite people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrent and former members of the military are regularly part of white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, and the U.S. Department of Defense has done a lousy job, intentionally or otherwise, in rooting them out.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t simply that a bunch of bigots wrote threatening words on the dorms of five cadet candidates; that\u2019s almost to be expected. The issue is that the military, despite the rhetoric, has not adequately rooted out racist sentiments in the ranks, yet still expects (and in fact depends on) large numbers of African Americans to join up and serve, even if that means facing an enemy on the field\u2014or in your barracks.\n\nThese kids are expected to go right back to work knowing full well that whoever wrote those messages may never be found or could be plotting something more serious. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected of black people in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a week when conservatives have chastised black athletes as not showing proper respect for the flag representing the United States and the soldiers who fight for our freedom, it\u2019s fitting that one of our most prestigious military institutions provides us with a stark reminder.\n\nAmerica, and the military that protects it, has generally failed to provide the support, respect, opportunity and safety for black people that it has for white people.\n\nThat lack of respect for our blood and sacrifice, or the future blood and sacrifice of cadets at the Air Force Academy, is much worse than any disrespect allegedly coming from taking a knee.", "keywords": ["violence", "soldiers", "doorsand", "racial", "slur", "black", "academy", "response", "white", "scrawled", "cadets", "respect", "air", "military", "force", "weak"], "polarity": -0.017184373749499816, "subjectivity": 0.33362191030258254},

Outgoing 2016 Miss USA Deshauna Barber crowned her fellow Washington, D.C., resident, K\u00e1ra McCullough, 25, Sunday night in Las Vegas.\n\nMcCullough is a chemist working for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Two black women were named Miss USA, back to back, in front of a white audience. I am not the biggest fan of pageants\u2014or any related beauty competitions\u2014but even for me, this made me smile.\n\n\n\nFor the past few years, the nation\u2019s capital has watched as it has slowly changed from chocolate city to vanilla latte city, so it was good to see the District maintain some semblance of melanin on a national stage. But the more McCullough talked, the more I realized that her comments epitomized the adage, \u201cAll skinfolk ain\u2019t kinfolk.\u201d While recognizing this, I was still happy to see a black woman\u2014an HBCU graduate, no less\u2014be crowned by her successor, another HBCU graduate. These are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSadly, many of the now-crowned champion\u2019s comments remind us that the former owner of Miss USA is Donald Trump. Surely, there is no coincidence in the similarity between McCullough\u2019s and Trump\u2019s god-awful responses related to health care and feminism. But then I remembered: Only one is systematically oppressing communities in ways that literally cause the death of already marginalized individuals.\n\n\n\nThe question-and-answer portion of any pageant is a somewhat cringeworthy but exciting moment to see. Sometimes we hear beautiful responses from contestants on contentious issues. Other times, we hear terrible answers, none of which will be worse than that of Caitlin Upton, a 2007 pageant competitor from South Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike many other pageant contestants during the Q&A portion, McCullough gave a very direct answer about our country\u2019s health care system. These statements likely caused more discussion than McCullough\u2019s win itself, even sparking intense debates on social media.\n\nJust two weeks after House Republicans started to roll back health care efforts by passing the American Health Care Act, McCullough was asked, \u201cDo you think affordable health care for all U.S. citizens is a right or a privilege, and why?\u201d Unbeknownst to her, McCullough tied a relatively privileged experience into her analysis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a government employee, I am granted health care. And I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs. So therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment [so] that we\u2019re given the opportunity to have health care as well as jobs [for] all the American citizens worldwide.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all fairness, being able to access health care in the U.S. and in many other countries is a privilege. It certainly shouldn\u2019t be, particularly given the conservatives\u2019 mission to make simply living a pre-existing condition, but it is, arguably, a privilege. The question then becomes: Should accessing health care be a privilege? Of course not.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s the misconception of \u201cyou need to have jobs\u201d that makes her statement more indefensible. The government needs to fix its current jobs while also providing people with health care so that they won\u2019t die merely because our economic system prevents such care from being affordable. Even unemployed and underemployed people deserve access to services, and they don\u2019t have to be connected to government jobs.\n\n\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t bad enough, when asked about feminism, McCullough said, \u201cAs a woman scientist in the government, I\u2019d like to lately transpose the word feminism to equalism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did she just say? There is no such thing, and her answer was merely an attempt to not appear divisive. Mission not accomplished.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake: Some of McCullough\u2019s answers are what happens when only science, technology, engineering and mathematics are emphasized with no foundation in liberal arts. McCullough\u2019s statements in both of her answers were vapid, lacked minimal thought and were, hopefully, the result of a 30-second pressured thought as opposed to a fully considered response. Nonetheless, I recognize that at her age, I was guilty of having many of the same views on issues about which I developed a fuller understanding as I matured.\n\nWe have a tendency to throw away like trash even our own people. I don\u2019t want to do that in this case, at least not so quickly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do want to critique McCullough for making statements that can undeniably and negatively affect marginalized communities. Simultaneously, l want to honor McCullough for fighting within a system of white supremacy\u2014even within a pageantry that only uplifts particular standards of beauty\u2014that often tells black women that they aren\u2019t smart, or worthy, or valuable enough.\n\nWe can do both.\n\nWe can critique whom we love. We can love that McCullough won and hate the answers that got her there. We can be happy to see her take that walk as Miss USA, and be outraged that someone with her politics will now have a magnified platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs black people, we must attempt to navigate the world with compassion yet discernment. Because when we start to treat all black people the same way we treat white people, like Miley Cyrus, who have little to no connection to us and our sociopolitical and economic identities, then I reckon we lost a long time ago.", "keywords": ["mcculloughs", "graduate", "problematic", "care", "black", "jobs", "shes", "mccullough", "proud", "usa", "hell", "hbcu", "2017", "answers", "health", "privilege", "miss"], "polarity": 0.05362205801860974, "subjectivity": 0.47662105455208903},

The measure would strike the death penalty from being considered as a sentencing option for aggravated murder. If the bill passes, the harshest sentence in the state would instead be life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Statehouse, which has a two-person Democratic majority.\n\nThanks to Gov. Jay Inslee, there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington since 2014.\n\nLawmakers cited the cost of maintaining the death penalty and incidents of wrongful convictions as reasons to abolish capital punishment. According to the Times, one Seattle University study from 2015 found that death penalty cases in Washington \u201ccost $1 million more than similar cases where capital punishment [was] not sought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the co-sponsors of the bill, state Sen.

This unequal application of the punishment was among the reasons Inslee instilled the moratorium.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nIn a written statement issued after the vote, Inslee said that when he enacted the moratorium, \u201cI hoped it would create space for a discussion about the unequal application of this law, the enormous costs of seeking this punishment and the uncertainty of closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d \u201cI hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the bill passes in the Statehouse, Washington will join 19 other states and the District of Columbia in ridding itself of the death penalty. Three other states\u2014Oregon, Colorado and Pennsylvania\u2014currently have moratoriums on the practice.\n\n", "keywords": ["penalty", "bill", "death", "washington", "abolishing", "capital", "white", "step", "punishment", "inslee", "takes", "times", "state", "crucial"], "polarity": 0.08377192982456139, "subjectivity": 0.4065789473684211},

Instead, the dealerships released a statement indicating that Miller and the company had been in contract negotiations to renew his endorsement deal since March, but (and here is the key) they decided to \u201cevaluate\u201d their options after Miller took a knee this weekend.\n\nThe statement read in part:\n\nWe are evaluating the events of the weekend.

African Americans bear the heaviest burden of HIV infection of all racial or ethnic groups in the United States, says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And the burden of this disease is carried squarely on the shoulders of African-American women. Their rates of new HIV infections are more than three times higher than those of white women and four times those of Hispanic women. Recent CDC data show that almost 75,000 African Americans are unaware that they are living with HIV.\n\nThrough my work as an HIV/AIDS prevention advocate over the past decade, I\u2019ve learned that the \u201cwhy\u201d is a little more complicated than the \u201cwhat\u201d when it comes to breaking down these inequities. And these inequities have fueled my passion to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS in communities of color. Through research and community interventions, I\u2019ve learned that a lethal mix of economic, social, cultural, biological, environmental and behavioral factors contribute to the HIV/AIDS devastation in communities of color.\n\n\n\nWith financial support for health care facing an uncertain political future, it\u2019s important that other initiatives step up to look for solutions to persisting health challenges, particularly those\u2014like the continuing too-high rate of women of color with HIV\u2014that have faded from the front pages.\n\n\n\nLooking at the statistics along with the contributing factors makes it easy to assume that the future for infected African-American women is grim. What these facts and figures underestimate is the ability of African-American women to turn the tide on this deadly disease. The statistics downplay the resilience of a group of women who continue to thrive in the face of many other challenges.\n\n\n\nThrough progressive and thoughtful interventions such as Project DASH (Divas Against the Spread of HIV/AIDS), African-American women infected with HIV/AIDS are using empowerment and education to manage their diagnoses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn intervention leverages the close relationships between infected mothers and their daughters to break the cycle of HIV/AIDS. Project DASH is a mixed-methods study that explores the relationship and communication between daughters and their HIV-positive mothers as predictors of sexual behaviors and HIV risk of the daughters.\n\n\n\nThe objectives of the study are to: 1) explore the experiences of HIV-positive minority women in New Jersey in accessing and navigating the health care system, 2) examine the relationship and communication characteristics between daughters and their HIV-positive mothers and their impact on HIV prevention, and 3) serve as an intervention that targets mother-daughter communication about sexual matters as a methodology to reduce HIV risk.\n\n\n\nThe preliminary results of Project DASH have tremendous potential to identify additional drivers of HIV/AIDS in urban communities and examine specific elements of the mother-daughter relationship that can protect daughters against HIV risk and modifiable risk factors.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe findings from this study suggest a very powerful and effective solution: Providing comprehensive services that include culturally sensitive education components, in addition to strengthening an individual\u2019s existing personal, social and environmental support networks, can improve health outcomes among African-American women living with HIV.\n\n\n\nThe next steps for Project DASH include the submission of a grant application to develop an intervention that will train both mothers and daughters to be health ambassadors to be agents of change in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women are naturally strong, even in the face of HIV/AIDS.

With no action necessary from people who were convicted, 3,038 misdemeanor convictions will be dismissed and sealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, NPR reports, prosecutors will review nearly 5,000 additional felony convictions to see if they can be reduced to misdemeanors.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the dismissals will happen automatically, requiring no effort on the part of those with marijuana-related offenses on their records to expunge those convictions themselves. Gasc\u00f3n, in a statement, noted that although petitioning to have these records cleared has been in place in San Francisco, the process is costly and can require legal help. It was noted that only 23 such petitions were filed in the last year.\n\nThe decision will disproportionately affect the city\u2019s black and Latinx residents, who\u2019ve been arrested at far greater rates than their white peers throughout the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NPR, which cites numbers from the district attorney\u2019s office, San Francisco\u2019s black residents made up just 7.8 percent of the city\u2019s population but made up 41 percent of marijuana-related arrests in 2000. A decade later, even though the percentage of black people living in San Francisco dropped (to 6 percent), they made up an even greater share of marijuana-related arrests, at nearly 50 percent.\n\nThat number was even worse than California\u2019s statewide average.

The risk of sexual assault is five times higher in adult facilities than in juvenile facilities. To reduce the likelihood of abuse, in compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act, prison staff often throw youth into solitary confinement, which has disastrous psychological and physiological effects.\n\nRemember what happened to Kalief Browder, who, as a 16-year-old, was accused of stealing a backpack and spent three years on Rikers Island, New York City\u2019s notorious jail complex, because his family could not afford bail.

I think it\u2019s important for us to wrestle with and bring an end to the \u2018race as dangerous stereotype\u2019 because of the profoundly dangerous consequences it has to people that look like me and Buck,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m acutely aware that this is not just Buck that this case affects because of what\u2019s happening in the world all about, with the police shootings. It\u2019s all about \u2018Black is dangerous,\u2019 so obviously the case implicates those concerns very powerfully even though it doesn\u2019t raise them explicitly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Swarns is confident in her argument, and confident that the law is on her side. After all, Americans decided decades ago that an individual could not be judged based on his or her race. She wants to close the argument once and for all, naturally hoping that the Supreme Court will rule in Buck\u2019s favor, but also that the court will ensure that the message will come across loud and clear that this kind of racially motivated sentencing cannot be allowed.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the Supreme Court to rule here to make clear to the lower courts that you can\u2019t turn a blind eye to \u2026 this kind of egregious racial discrimination because of the impact that it has not just on the case at hand but on the integrity of [the] criminal-justice system overall, on public perception of its reliability and its integrity. When these kinds of questions are squarely on the table, there\u2019s sort of a higher burden,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd for Swarns, it also goes far beyond race.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where today black people are dangerous, but tomorrow somebody else is dangerous. So I think that although this certainly resonates right now among people of color, it\u2019s an argument and a theory that should concern everybody because it could be any quality,\u201d she mused. \u201cAny quality could be a basis for an execution, and no immutable characteristic should be considered in that capacity \u2026 I don\u2019t think we want to travel that road.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreanna Edwards is news editor at The Root.

Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump made his comments after the reasons he gave for firing FBI Director James Comey during an NBC interview Thursday were directly contradicted by statements made by others in the White House, including Vice President Mike Pence, meaning that the various explanations were at best misleading and, at worst, flat out lies.\n\nTrump sent out two tweets Friday suggesting that he would cancel White House press briefings and instead hand out written statements to communicate with the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent explanations have been given for Comey\u2019s firing, and the stories coming out of the Trump White House have changed each day since it happened. As the Post notes, this calls into question the credibility of not only press secretary Sean Spicer but also Pence, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway.\n\nSpicer told reporters Friday that the president was \u201cdismayed\u201d that the focus was on the accuracy of the statements delivered by his spokesmen.\n\n\u201cThe president is an active president.

Rosenstein, but by Wednesday the word was that Trump had been considering firing Comey for a long time, and made the final determination after hearing from Sessions and Rosenstein.\n\nAll along, his spokesmen have maintained that Trump\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the ongoing Russia investigation that Comey was overseeing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said that he made the decision to fire Comey on his own and that he would have done it regardless of what Rosenstein recommended, adding that he had been thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he came to his decision to fire Comey.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story; it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election th they should have won,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["briefings", "russia", "thing", "end", "staff", "white", "threatens", "statements", "trump", "house", "cant", "president", "firing", "comey", "press", "straight"], "polarity": 0.10148809523809524, "subjectivity": 0.4449404761904762},

Sometimes those debates end with us walking away for a time and \"liking\" each other's statuses on Facebook so that we know we're still good\u2014because that's what you do in 2016 in a hyperconnected world.\n\nWhat has enabled us to remain friends is the fact that, though we come from wildly different backgrounds and experiences, we are both committed to the fight for social justice, particularly as it pertains to women's reproductive rights, and we both have faith in the moral core of the other. We both believe that a better world is possible, even if we have different road maps for how to get there.\n\nAfter one such debate\u2014which occurred at the crack of dawn\u2014I read one of Plimpton's statuses on her private Facebook page that was both powerful and self-aware. In a blunt statement to white liberals who remain silent in the face of state-perpetuated and state-sanctioned violence against communities of color, Plimpton made it plain that white fragility in the face of black anger and frustration at apparent white obliviousness is ultimately self-serving and nothing more than a flimsy excuse to walk away from issues that should be urgent for us all.\n\nAudre Lorde taught us that there is nothing black women can do with the guilt of white women unless that guilt is turned into action\u2014and she was right. There is nothing that black women can do, or should do, with white women's anger when that anger is solely used as justification for their own silence or apathy\u2014not that the two reactions are mutually exclusive. As Lorde wrote:\n\n\n\nI cannot hide my anger to spare you guilt, nor hurt feelings, nor answering anger; for to do so insults and trivializes all our efforts. Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one\u2019s own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge. Yet all too often, guilt is just another name for impotence, for defensiveness destructive of communication; it becomes a device to protect ignorance and the continuation of things the way they are, the ultimate protection for changelessness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that end, it is past time that white people, particularly those in positions of power and influence, \"speak directly\" to other white people about being beneficiaries of white privilege\u2014and that is exactly what Plimpton has done.\n\nHer words were directed toward her circle of white friends who sometimes don't know what to say, let alone do, in the fight against institutional violence against people of color. And she was able to engage them in a way that black people not only are tired of doing but also shouldn't be expected to do as we navigate a white supremacist system that hates us for our freedom.\n\nToni Morrison taught us that explaining ourselves and our reason for being is a distraction from the work that needs to be done. It keeps us from claiming joy. It keeps us from claiming victories that\u2014as my sister and Drug Policy Alliance Senior Director asha bandele reminds me\u2014are all around us. It keeps us from laughing hard and loving harder because our focus is on the white gaze and justifying ourselves to those who should know better and often do know better, but who choose comfortable silence or open antagonism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Plimpton has done here is begin building the critical foundation of allyship. It is the self-reckoning of someone who wants to be better and who wants white people, particularly white liberals, in this context, to be better\u2014even when they are tired and frustrated or angry\u2014because, as she wrote:\n\n\n\nI can handle some people thinking I'm a \u2026 cracker for a few days because I said or did an oblivious thing that either came out wrong or was based in some self-focused [a\u2014] thought. What I can't handle is the thought that if I were a black woman in this country, catching a cop on the wrong day could result in the death of my husband, my partner, or my child. Or myself.\n\nWhat you are about to read is unedited, unscripted and initially meant to be off the books\u2014but, with Plimpton's permission, it is now on the record. This is a white-privilege check. Testing, check 1 \u2026 check 2 \u2026\n\nRant alert: *Context note: This is mainly for my white, liberal friends and cohorts whose hearts and minds are in the right place, but who have felt alienated or uncomfortable at various times when a movement doesn't include us whiteys as primary partners, or when the Black Feminist/Womanist movements, which oftentimes use the terms \"White Feminism\" or \"White Feminists\" when drawing attention to inequities in feminist action and thought, appears to be antagonizing, rather than inclusive in the ways that we nice, polite white peoples prefer (I say this with love!) These are not new ideas and I am not saying anything original, or even new for me. I'm just compelled, by recent events and the recent calls for white people to start showing up and being present for our compatriots, to write this, because I know there is a history of [f\u2014ked] up communication that is largely the result of white people not liking to be re-directed, myself included: A lot of white people are nervous about their ability to be allies in the fight against systemic racism for reasons that are purely self-conscious. I've certainly had those feelings and I'm not proud of them, even if they're human. No one wants to look like an [a\u2014hole], even if that makes us look like a bigger [a\u2014hole]. But there's no way to get it right all the time, and white people are used to not having to explain ourselves or change our ideas or accept that we're not central to, well, anything. So we get freaked out when some people of color get annoyed and fed up and tell us they're not here to \"educate\" us, or that how we've acted or spoken was ignorant, so why bother, etc. We feel like we're not being accepted and appreciated for our efforts, and we want to throw our hands in the air and say, \"Well, fine, then, good luck! I guess you don't need me, then!\" This is a stupid thing to do, and a mistake on about 42,987 levels. Not least because it reveals we're not actually being allies, we're just wanting to be thanked, which is NOT WHAT WE ARE HERE FOR. Being human is hard. Being a decent human is harder. Being a decent human who tries new things and is willing to make mistakes and [f\u2014k] up and still keep trying is even harder than that. But think of all the human beings we live with, and beside, and among, who pay a price for being human and OF COLOR that us white people literally cannot fathom. I can handle some people thinking I'm a turd-head cracker for a few days because I said or did an oblivious thing that either came out wrong or was based in some self-focused a**-thought. What I can't handle is the thought that if I were a Black woman in this country, catching a cop on the wrong day could result in the death of my husband, my partner, or my child. Or myself. I am going to say and do\u2014[f\u2014k] it, I have said and done\u2014some stupid [s\u2014t] in my life. Some of it prolly in the last 24 hours. None of it has ever, or will ever, cause my life to be in jeopardy. Being thought a schmuck will not kill me. Even BEING a schmuck will not kill me. What I am trying to express here is that white people have basically nothing to be afraid of, or lose, by trying to be present and conscious and helpful to our fellow humans of color, even if we fall flat or [f\u2014k] up. We have nothing to lose. And sure, there are these \"white people middle class losing ground blah blah\" think pieces and whatever, and fine, they can write those and we can think about that [s\u2014t] if we want to. But I am not terribly interested in those. As my Mom always says and I'm fond of parroting, \"I don't really care WHY you're an [a\u2014hole]. It's enough that you're an [a\u2014hole].\" That's kind of how I feel about white middle-class angst. So I am willing to be a schmuck and fail and say the wrong thing. It's better than saying nothing, trying nothing, and believing that that is an adequate way to live my life. Be a schmuck for your fellow citizens. Fail for them. Say the wrong thing, for them. Reveal your ignorance, for them. Accept the dressing down, for them. Be human, for them. Learn to crawl so you can learn to walk so you can learn to do what is right. That's all we are here to do on this planet: become better. It costs us nothing. There is a far greater price to pay in watching our fellow citizens, our sisters and brothers and neighbors and loved ones and friends and family and fellow Americans, have to fight for their right not to die because somebody else had a bad [f\u2014king] day and didn't feel like holding fire this time. I'll humiliate myself any time in the act of trying. It's my job at work, and it's my job as a human being. And it won't kill me. \u2014 Martha Plimpton\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKirsten West Savali is a cultural critic and an associate editor at The Root.

Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["juror", "mcknight", "justice", "joe", "black", "woman", "white", "nfl", "parish", "jury", "player", "jefferson", "shooting", "gasser", "help"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

They know that being seen as \u201cbad [black] dudes\u201d on the court or the field brings accolades, but being seen as a \u201cbad [black] dude\u201d on the streets of America will get you killed by those sworn to protect you.\n\nIt\u2019s not too much to sit out a national anthem when members of your ethnic group can be shot dead in the street.\n\nFamous football players, writers and armchair critics argue that Kaepernick-style protests of state-sanctioned murder at the expense of our national rituals are counterproductive. To be \u201cpatriotic\u201d by way of observance of national rituals is the most principled and effective way to bring attention to police brutality and build community. The flag and its associated rituals of observance allow everyone to protest, and that allowance is the community glue that binds us all. Herein lies the belief in the mother country\u2014patriotism\u2014that keeps us together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who criticize high school players\u2019 modest gestures of protest fail to recognize that second-class citizenry degrades real patriotism. When life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness can be taken away because you\u2019re not considered an authentic citizen of America, the ritual of pledges are purely symbolic. A reasonable amount of justice is required for authentic patriotism. Protesters are simply demanding that America do its part.\n\nMost often, detractors wield patriotism to delay or deny the just allocation of inalienable rights and other political goods that black people are owed.\n\nNow flag-waving decriers are facing their worst nightmare: Disaffected young people are demanding receipts for revering the flag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people can\u2019t eat, learn from, be housed by or be protected by American symbolism. Just economic, educational and housing policies do that\u2014all of which black people are simply stepping out of the shadows of the American flag to attain. This political poetry isn\u2019t a luxury.\n\nThe cynic in me says that the thousands of high school football players who chose to kneel during the national anthem across the country, giving many heartburn, still observed the most transcendent American ritual by playing the game. Nonetheless, pledging allegiance and/or standing for the national anthem in the absence of basic political goods is what really wears the U.S. flag threadbare. Don\u2019t blame high school football players for desecrating our secular religion; blame institutions that fail to deliver basic rights.\n\nIn addition to insidiously charging football players with what amounts to misguided heresy, there is a constant devaluation of black and brown resistance as a catalyst of change. American reform movements were not categorically shaped by a presumed adoption of the transcendent secular values of hope and radical respectability that shaped significant American reform movements. Martin Luther King Jr. is often evoked as the standard-bearer of black radicalism: \u201cLook at Martin. He wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Sojourner Truth\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d to Frederick Douglass\u2019 \u201cWhat to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\u201d to Colin Kaepernick, blacks have used American symbols and ideals as foils to highlight overwhelming hypocrisy rather than exhort their unyielding belief in a mother country.\n\nMaybe critics never heard of Marcus Garvey or understood his impact on black radical thought. W.E.B. Du Bois died in Accra, Ghana, where he became a citizen. Malcolm X famously said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an American. I\u2019m one of 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the \u2026 victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So I\u2019m not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag saluter, or a flag-waver\u2014no, not I! I\u2019m speaking as a victim of this American system. I don\u2019t see any American dream; I see an American nightmare!\u201d\n\nDid these great thinkers not shape the black struggle for civil rights? It was those who risked their lives saying they couldn\u2019t prostrate themselves to an ideal until they were recognized as full citizens that made change in this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney-esque calls for solidarity in belief have led to a system of education that underfunds schools populated by black and brown folk. Thousands of undocumented students do everything required of citizenship in the mother country, including the pledging of allegiance, but can\u2019t seem to get financial aid or the expectation of stable residency. And, of course, black students can be shot for wearing a hoodie and eating Skittles.\n\nThe sustainability and credibility of a diverse democracy doesn\u2019t require common practice of rituals, but it does require fair treatment under the law. The policing of black and brown bodies, inadequate schools and substandard housing do more to corrode cohesiveness than the observance of a theorized secular religion.\n\nThose who want to make the anthem sacred all but say that in order to appeal to whites for support, black and brown folk should be grateful and respectful rather than make claims for basic justice. Black and brown people are suffering under the flag. Moving from underneath it exposes the punishment that American ideals inflict on those who aren\u2019t deemed full citizens of this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["national", "kaepernicks", "continue", "flag", "brown", "slaying", "black", "shot", "players", "american", "protest", "cop", "terence", "school", "football", "crutchers", "high"], "polarity": 0.05328301423662247, "subjectivity": 0.3997177221404024},

I tried to get into one of the toga parties, but they wouldn\u2019t let me in.\n\nAt least I think it was a toga party, because everyone was wearing white sheets ... and white hoods.

It looked like a lot of fun!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is speculation that the entire fraternity could be kicked off the yard because of an ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller.

The departmental also confirmed that it will be examining its policy on texts that are allowed, as well as \u201call current lists of banned written materials.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, even though at least two prisons in the state had the book on the no-go list, the Department of Corrections noted that the book was used by the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education Program, which gives inmates the opportunity to enroll in college-level courses, citing that as one of the reasons the ban was lifted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOfficials determined that the book should not have been banned, as evidenced by the fact that it is being utilized as a teaching tool for NJ-STEP students.\u201d New Jersey Department of Corrections spokesperson Matthew Schuman told the Times.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA lot of things look funny in the light, and when prisons ban a critically acclaimed book about the discrimination black people face in the criminal-justice system ... well, that\u2019s more than a little funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, according to The Guardian, that\u2019s exactly what is happening in some prisons in New Jersey, which have reportedly banned Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness .\n\nRecords obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through a public-records request show that the book, which was published in 2010, is on lists of publications inmates in state facilities may not possess.

For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

In Ohio, accomplices to murder can receive the same punishment as the actual killers, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last time she had set foot in her neighborhood was as a teenage girl. On Monday, Patterson was free on parole. Now 41 years old and flanked by television cameras, she held her mother once again for the first time in decades outside their home.\n\n\u201cI am so in love with you, Mama,\u201d she said.\n\nLater, inside the family home, Patterson, brushing a strand of hair from her mother\u2019s face, tearfully told reporters, \u201cTo sit here with my best friend and my mother is the best part of my Christmas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this w3.cdn.anvato.net embed.\n\nPatterson maintained her innocence the entire time she was imprisoned, claiming that Dayton police coerced her into confessing to a robbery she didn\u2019t commit. According to the Daily News, that robbery\u2014over a necklace\u2014opened her up to the aggravated-murder conviction.\n\nNow, thanks to a public campaign for her exoneration that brought in celebrities, politicians and the victim\u2019s own sister, Patterson is free\u2014though not exonerated. In fact, Michelle\u2019s sister, Hollie Lai Holbrook, who was with her when she was killed, may have been the key to Patterson\u2019s freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Dayton Daily News reports, Patterson was one of five people charged for the murder of Michelle and the robbery of Hollie Lai Holbrook and three other girls. According to court records, Michelle\u2019s group had been out \u201crogueing\u201d\u2014stealing from garages\u2014that day when they ran into Patterson\u2019s group, which included Michelle\u2019s killer, LaShawna Keeney.\n\nA Guardian article from 2016 lays out the complexities of the case.\n\nPatterson says that Dayton police forced her to admit that she had robbed a necklace from one of the girls\u2014an act that would make her an active participant in the violent crimes committed against Michelle and her sister and friends. But Patterson never actually did so, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Hollie Lai Holbrook, one of the victims, had claimed that Patterson was innocent as well.\n\nLast year, Lai Holbrook told The Guardian that, when Dayton police arrived at the scene of the crime, she singled out Patterson as someone who had nothing to do with her sister\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cI remember pointing someone out that night and saying to the police: \u2018She didn\u2019t do it, she didn\u2019t have anything to do with it\u2019; that kept going around my head over and over again,\u201d Lai Holbrook told the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who was 18 at the time of her sister\u2019s death, even provided a detailed description of Patterson: \u201cShe was biracial; dark, long hair. I recall she had a coat on, a fluffy coat,\u201d she recalled telling police.\n\nBut police convinced Lai Holbrook to believe that Patterson was involved after telling her that Patterson had confessed to robbing one of the girls.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only way the state failed Patterson. As The Guardian recounts, not only was she forced to make a false admission to law enforcement, but the courts failed her, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nPatterson was inadequately represented at trial, with her defense attorney at the time telling the Guardian that his handling of the case was in his view the lowest point of his career as a lawyer. The defense team dissuaded Patterson from going into the witness box because she \u201cspoke too hood\u201d ... The trial defense team also decided to withhold from the jury a tape recording of a 911 call Patterson made to emergency workers soon after the murder happened. Six of the 12 members of the jury have given affidavits saying that if they had known about the 911 call they would have found her not guilty.\n\nA juror on the case who felt strongly that Patterson was innocent also told the paper that she had \u201ccaved in\u201d to a guilty verdict after being told that it was late and that \u201ca fellow juror was pregnant and needed to go home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who wrote a letter to Ohio Gov. John Kasick last year advocating for Patterson\u2019s exoneration, said that family pressure and trauma led her to bury her doubts about Patterson\u2019s conviction for years.\n\n\u201cI knew I was wrong. But I didn\u2019t want to be the black sheep of the family, the odd one out, and I didn\u2019t want to have to relive that night; I just wanted it buried,\u201d Lai Holbrook admitted to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cWhen the police offered us little hints and pieces of information, it made it easier for me to overlook what really happened that night. The prosecutors were intimidating,\u201d Lai Holbrook added. \u201cNot just to me, to all of us. They were just scary. It seemed like they pushed the fact that all these girls did what they did, and that there was a confession.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Christmas Day, Patterson and her family credited Lai Holbrook with reuniting them at last.\n\n\u201cHolly Lai is a hero, and she has been an advocate for me,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nPatterson, a sixth-grade dropout, will now work for the Ohio Justice and Policy Center in Cincinnati.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do great things,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in prison who are innocent.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Dayton Daily News.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said Tyra Patterson had been exonerated.

According to the Associated Press, Ibrahim Gaidam, the governor of Yobe state, initially set the number of girls who were missing at 84, but family members quickly rejected the tally and issued a list of missing daughters, totaling 105.\n\n\u201cThis list did not come from the school management or any government source but collated by us from the parents of the girls,\u201d said Bashir Manzo, who is heading up the efforts to locate the stolen students. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the governor is still being fed with fake information about these poor girls.\u201d\n\nFormer (but still my) President Barack Obama sent troops to Chad after the militant Islamic group kidnapped 200 Nigerian girls in 2014. Although Obama was criticized for his delay in sending help, Chad became a U.S. ally in the fight against Boko Haram, and its military is considered one of the most capable and stable in the region. The country had dedicated more than 2,000 troops to the war against the extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2015, Boko Haram controlled territory in West Africa the size of Belgium, but Nigerian and Chadian forces gained almost all of it back. Boko Haram had been almost totally defeated in the region. The country\u2019s military also played a huge role in cooling tensions in Mali and was most prominently fighting terrorists in Niger.\n\nAnd then Donald Trump issued his travel ban.\n\nAlthough geopolitical experts couldn\u2019t figure out why the executive order included Chad, the Trump administration pointed out that there were a number of terrorist groups in the area, which is exactly why you don\u2019t piss off the people most capable of fighting them! Others speculated that Trump\u2019s decision might have something to do with Chad being a majority-Muslim country. And a black country. Chad, in response, began pulling troops back from the war against Boko Haram, a move predicted by almost every foreign policy expert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s reported comments calling Nigeria a \u201cshithole country\u201d not only infuriated many of the countries on the African continent but also served as an obstacle to Nigerian-U.S. relations, which had grown increasingly warm under Obama. Trump\u2019s insults and \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies likely signaled to Boko Haram that the U.S. intervention that took place under Obama was probably not going to happen during the Trump administration.\n\nAnd now the newly emboldened Boko Haram has stolen 105 girls, thanks in part to the hands-off, shade-throwing Trump administration. When asked to comment on the missing Nigerian girls, Trump expressed his support by taking a break from excusing white supremacists, golfing at Mar-a-Lago and tongue-kissing the National Rifle Association\u2019s chapped, wrinkled balloon knot to say:\n\nWell ... we\u2019ll let you know when he says something.", "keywords": ["idiot", "105", "troops", "chad", "racist", "country", "missing", "nigerian", "donald", "trump", "obama", "haram", "boko", "girls"], "polarity": 0.09824464153732447, "subjectivity": 0.43283444198078336},

She\u2019s only one of the biggest and boldest characters from one of Alice Walker\u2019s most famous works, The Color Purple. There are certain movies that stand the test of time, and The Color Purple is one of those classics. There\u2019s something so special about gathering with family for the holidays and watching this slice of black life unfold on our screens while we recite the most famous lines, like \u201cHelllll naw!\u201d and \u201cYou told Harpo to beat me!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the 1985 film adaptation of the book, we got to see a physical manifestation of Shug Avery, played by Margaret Avery. In the movie, we\u2019re introduced to Shug\u2014whose name suggests sweetness\u2014with the iconic line \u201cYou sho\u2019 is ugly!\u201d directed at Celie, the docile and insecure wife of Albert (aka Mr.).\n\n\n\nShug represented a woman who was a departure from the women of the first half of the 20th century. She was stubborn, reckless, firm, selfish, honest, loud, lusty and likely the most free-spirited woman of her time. She was admired by men and women alike, but not only because of the glitz and glamour she put on full display in elaborate red-sequined dresses and feathery headpieces. Shug was the freedom that most women of that time wouldn\u2019t have even dared to dream of. Shug was a free black woman at a time that didn\u2019t allow any women freedoms.\n\n\n\nCelie was obsessed with Shug. She wanted to know what Shug saw in her husband, Mr., and eventually was drawn in by Shug\u2019s undeniable magnetism and was able to explore her own sexuality. Shug was sex-positive before sex positivity existed. She was fluid in her desires and allowed herself to explore them with reckless abandon.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve watched The Color Purple an embarrassing number of times, and for me, Shug has always stuck out. She was the kind of woman I could see myself being (minus the whole sleeping-with-someone-else\u2019s-husband thing): free to come and go as she pleased, fearless enough to ask for and get what she wanted, well-traveled and adored onstage; and above all else, she embodied the actual color purple. When you mix the colors blue and red, you\u2019re presented with the color purple. Shug was a perfect mix of the fire and passion of red, and the cool and calm of blue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of this about Shug Avery to suggest that her carefree and open-minded lifestyle might just be one from which to gain inspiration. Alice Walker knows this, which is likely why, in her book The Temple of My Familiar, Walker included an excerpt titled, \u201cThe Gospel According to Shug Avery.\u201d As I was reading it, I was overwhelmed by Shug\u2019s levelheaded voice of reason regarding sexuality, humanity, racism and more.\n\n\n\nEquality has always been a fight in this world, and a character like Shug Avery shows you that despite the world\u2019s rules, she intends to get her own piece of the pie. In Donald Trump\u2019s America, we face all the isms that could ever exist, and each day there seems to be a new battle to fight. If only the world would subscribe to Shug\u2019s gospel, maybe we\u2019d be living in a better place ... or at least someone like Trump wouldn\u2019t have been elected president.\n\n\n\nWe should all be like Shug Avery, I say. Here are just a few pieces of her gospel:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHELPED are those who are enemies of their own racism; they shall live in harmony with the citizens of this world, and not with those of their ancestors, which has passed away, and which they shall never see again.\n\nHELPED are those too busy living to respond when they are wrongfully attacked: on their walks they shall find mysteries so intriguing as to distract them from every blow.\n\nHELPED are those who are content to be themselves; they will never lack mystery in their lives and the joys of self-discovery will be constant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHELPED are those who live in quietness, knowing neither brand name nor fad; they shall live every day as if in eternity, and each moment shall be full as it is long.\n\nHELPED are those who strive to give up their anger; their reward will be that in any confrontation their first thoughts will never be of violence or war.\n\nHELPED are those who love the lesbian, the gay, and the straight, as they love the sun, the moon, and the stars. None of their children, nor any of their ancestors, nor any parts of themselves, shall be hidden from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow go forth and live your life like Shug Avery.", "keywords": ["according", "gospel", "live", "color", "world", "purple", "woman", "avery", "shug", "shall", "shugs", "women"], "polarity": 0.17376022949653086, "subjectivity": 0.5601405443871199},

Bleak because the country\u2019s top public health organization is now prohibited from using the term \u201cscience-based.\u201d Bleak because we\u2019re surprised that a man accused of sexually harassing and assaulting young girls\u2014and who extols slavery\u2014lost an election. Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

That discussion is too subjective, and no one will ever reach a consensus on any kind of art. Plus, some people have shit taste in music, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m about to argue music with anyone who believes 21 Savage is better than Nas.\n\nFor the sake of this argument, Bruno Mars is not black. He has a mixed racial background that includes Ashkenazi Jew, Puerto Rican and Filipino. One can debate where he fits in the African Diaspora, the meaning of \u201cblackness\u201d or whether race is an artificial construct. I can almost guarantee that if I called him right now and asked him to list his top five macaroni-makers, he\u2019d have to think about it for a minute, and none of the names in his top five would begin with the word \u201caunt.\u201d Black people created every form of American music. But there is a specific, indefinable genre of music that begins with R&B and encompasses hip-hop that we will heretofore refer to as \u201cblack music.\u201d\n\nThe furious debate about Bruno Mars and whether or not he is a cultural appropriator has bubbled beneath the surface of his career for a while. It existed before he remade Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk\u201d or Bell Biv DeVoe\u2019s \u201cFinesse.\u201d Even when\u2014\n\nWait ... I\u2019m being told that the previously mentioned songs are Bruno Mars originals. But I\u2019m pretty sure the S.O.S. Band made \u201c24 Karat Magic.\u201d I think it was the B side to \u201cTake Your Time,\u201d so let\u2019s use that as an example. What? That\u2019s an original song, too? OK, I\u2019m going to have to do a little more research on this and get back to you.\n\nBut before Bruno won a Grammy and Meshell Ndegeocello called him a karaoke singer, there were always people who thought that someone put Michael Jackson, Prince and James Brown into a blender with a quarter cup of lukewarm water, a dollop of mayonnaise and a smidge of racial ambiguity, and out came the next pop sensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation was reignited when this clip from the Grapevine (not this one; the other one) began circling the internet:\n\nSeren Aishitemasu, the woman in the clip makes a convincing argument breaking down why Bruno is a derivative artist who\u2014willingly or not\u2014gets to trade on his racial ambiguity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut does that necessarily mean he is guilty of cultural appropriation?\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of the term, but it generally relates to the use of the art, artifacts, symbology or anything of cultural significance to a minority or nondominant group of people by a person who is not in that group.\n\nWhat separates cultural appropriation from a cultural exchange or paying homage is when someone \u201cborrows\u201d an item or symbol of cultural significance without acknowledgment, attribution or permission. One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding the definition and the power dynamics involved in cultural appropriation is the key to understanding the concept. When Kim Kardashian put cornrows in her hair and called them \u201cBo Derek braids,\u201d it was cultural appropriation because she made no acknowledgment of the culture from which the style came.\n\nAnd yes, black people can be cultural appropriators. When a black woman wore a Native American headdress to Coachella as a costume, she was appropriating by using part of a culture\u2019s sacred ritual as cosplay. In fact, I am often accused of cultural appropriation. When people ask how I can use the white man\u2019s internet and type on a keyboard that a white man invented and not be considered an appropriator, I want to explain to them how stupid they sound, but I don\u2019t because they probably wouldn\u2019t understand the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when it comes to music and art, cultural appropriation is a tricky thing to decipher. A non-black person\u2019s involvement in a traditionally black art does not rise to the level of appropriation in and of itself. Bruno Mars is 32 years old, meaning that he grew up during a time when hip-hop and R&B ruled the charts as the most popular music in the world. Anyone making popular music in 2018 is\u2014by definition\u2014making black music, regardless of their color.\n\nTo be honest, it is incumbent on white artists to acknowledge that, even if it seems unfair.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is only doing what Janet Jackson did before her and Diana Ross did before her. But Beyonc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to bear the burden of acknowledging that every time she steps onstage because\u2014as a black woman\u2014she is an inheritor of that legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when Taylor Swift makes an album that looks like an unsweetened, gluten-free version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, it comes off as cultural appropriation, even though it is quite possible that Taylor Swift was influenced by the same artists as Queen Bey (although, judging from the fact that Swift looks like she\u2019s doing trigonometry in her head when she\u2019s doing dance choreography, I doubt it).\n\nSome might call it a double standard or reverse racism to demand that Swift and other white artists give a nod to borrowing from black music and culture while not requiring the same of black artists. However, being black means you are born into the legacy of the culture. I can walk into my grandmother\u2019s house and open the refrigerator without asking permission. You cannot.\n\nBut here is the fault line:\n\nBeing a part of a culture\u2014whether one is born into it or not\u2014also comes with the responsibility of being a caretaker of it. If we kept our mouths closed, non-blacks artists would suck our artistic heritage dry without caring what happened to whomever they left in the discarded heap. We gave Justin Timberlake a 2-decade get-out-of-appropriation-free pass. When he was finished doing his 20-years-long impression of an R&B singer, he became a \u201cMan of the Woods\u201d and distanced himself from black music like it was Janet Jackson\u2019s left titty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are black artists who have leaped to Bruno Mars\u2019 defense, saying that he is not guilty of appropriation. As someone who is only marginally aware of his music, every time I have seen him perform, give an interview or receive an award, including the Grammy, he has made sure to acknowledge that he was influenced by black music almost exclusively.\n\nSo, based on the definition of cultural appropriation, is Bruno Mars guilty?\n\nNope.\n\nEvery single word Seren said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I have a theory about the people who accuse Bruno Mars of cultural theft:\n\nMaybe they are tired of seeing people like Post Malone take bits of black culture and use them to make derivative, unoriginal content meant to be palatable for white mouths. Perhaps they are tired of seeing more-talented black artists outshone by beige newcomers who pass the paper-bag test and don\u2019t give white people the heebie-jeebies. It is possible that they are overzealous custodians of their culture.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars. Maybe they saw his act when Janelle Mon\u00e1e was doing the same thing for the past decade. Maybe they saw Bruno when he was Chris Brown. Or Bobby Brown. Or James Brown. Or MC Hammer. Or Prince. Or Michael Jackson. Or Janet Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, even if he is always careful to give props, maybe they understand that Kenny G is the best-selling jazz instrumentalist in the modern era, Eminem is the best-selling hip-hop artist of all time and there isn\u2019t a black face in the top five best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nBut they all make black music.\n\nTrust me, they know it.", "keywords": ["dont", "bruno", "controversy", "black", "artists", "doing", "white", "culture", "proves", "understand", "mars", "music", "appropriation", "cultural"], "polarity": 0.02780663780663778, "subjectivity": 0.41541666666666666},

He has spent more than 50 Christmases there, but he thought this year might be different. The parole board was set to hear his case for release, but on the day of the hearing, the board delayed it.\n\nIn 1963, when John F. Kennedy was president, a judge sentenced the then 17-year-old Montgomery to life without parole. America is the only place in the world where prosecutors regularly try kids as adults and request that kids be sentenced to die behind bars with no hope of freedom.\n\nBut Montgomery now has a second chance, thanks to a string of rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012 the Supreme Court recognized that kids are different from adults. They have underdeveloped brains, impairing judgment and impulse control, and are more susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure. Unsurprisingly, those who make their way into the criminal-justice system are often themselves victims (pdf) of physical abuse, sexual abuse, extreme poverty and trauma at elevated levels.\n\nBecause of these differences, the Supreme Court eliminated life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than murder, and severely limited it for kids charged with murder, ruling that only the \u201cirreparably corrupt\u201d can receive a juvenile life-without-parole sentence. And in 2016, in Henry Montgomery\u2019s appeal, the court made that decision retroactive.\n\nMontgomery is now one of the more than 2,100 \u201cjuvenile lifers\u201d in America\u2019s prisons waiting to plead their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the sentence prevails, especially in Michigan\u2014where we\u2019ve all lived and either played sports or coached. While 19 states and the District of Columbia have formally eliminated juvenile life without parole, and while prosecutors in most states almost never seek it, district attorneys in Michigan, Louisiana and a few isolated pockets are leading the charge to keep kids behind bars. Forever.\n\nTake Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. As of July of 2016 (pdf), Wayne County had more than 150 people with juvenile life-without-parole sentences\u2014the second highest in the country. Ninety percent of those kids are black, even though black people make up just 39 percent of the population. The elected prosecutor, Kym Worthy, has pushed to maintain the original life sentence in nearly 40 percent of cases of juvenile life without parole, even though the Supreme Court has said that only the rare kid should qualify. Jessica Cooper, the elected prosecutor in nearby Oakland County, Mich., is asking for death behind bars in almost 90 percent of the proceedings.\n\nDuring our recent Detroit listen-and-learn tour focused on juvenile justice, several of us heard moving stories about those juvenile lifers who have now been given a second chance. We met Edward Sanders, who at 17 was sentenced to life without parole for participating in a drive-by shooting even though he was not the shooter. His accomplishments behind bars are remarkable. He served on a Michigan committee to help improve relations between prison staff and inmates. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree, took a paralegal course and served as a resident jailhouse lawyer, helping other inmates with their pleadings. He even taught classes. And in July of this year, after more than 40 years in prison, he was resentenced and paroled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are hundreds of people like Sanders who are no longer a danger to society and have something to contribute. Like Sanders, they should be given an opportunity to show they have changed and earn their release.\n\nWhen prosecutors like those in Michigan ask to maintain juvenile life-without-parole sentences, they are saying that people who received lengthy sentences as kids should not have the opportunity to plead their cases to a parole board even after serving decades for their crimes\u2014no matter how changed or how successful they have been in classes or programs. That\u2019s a startling claim to make about a kid who committed a crime before he or she could vote, order a drink, join the military or, for some, drive a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese prosecutors are simply refusing to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. That should change. They should let individuals convicted as children plead their cases to a parole board after spending decades in prison, exercising empathy instead of relying on overly harsh juvenile sentences. State legislators can also pass legislation to end juvenile life without parole. We place trust in our elected officials to follow the law and do the right thing, but they are failing us. We call on our elected leaders to stop betraying the public trust and to end juvenile life without parole forever.\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nStan Van Gundy is head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

In an interview with Billboard to promote Ventriloquism, an album of covers, the singer-songwriter and musician made clear that she wasn\u2019t impressed with Mars\u2019 performance of the \u201cFinesse\u201d remix featuring Cardi B. No, she read him with the sort of blunt, matter-of-fact assessment you\u2019d expect from a black woman at 49 (or any age, arguably, though hell hath no fury like a seasoned black queen). Per Billboard:\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of Bruno that night at the Grammys? What he\u2019s doing is karaoke, basically. With \u201cFinesse,\u201d in particular, I think he was simply copying Bell Biv DeVoe. I think he was copying Babyface. And definitely there were some elements of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis back when they worked with Human League. I feel like there\u2019s just all these threads running through there, but not in a genuine way. How fine is that balance between karaoke and artistic interpretation? It\u2019s really a matter of musicality and being able to manipulate the tropes in a way that makes it feel personal. It can\u2019t just be a pastiche, where you\u2019re copying or mimicking an old sound or just doing karaoke. There has to be a form of sincerity.\n\nI\u2019ve always appreciated Meshell Ndegeocello for sounding naturally chopped and screwed, but now I can add her ability to dismantle a target with surgical precision to the list. Ndegeocello is not the first person to call out Bruno Mars for \u201ccopying\u201d other artists. Years ago, multiple critics noted that Mars\u2019 hit \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d sounded exactly like a Police song.\n\nBack then, Bruno Mars responded to the claims with the following admission:\n\n\u201cHell yeah! You try to write a Police song!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI grew up listening to the Police, I grew up performing in bars, singing Police songs. ... I remember performing a song like \u2018Roxanne,\u2019 and you play those first couple of chords, and you hit that first note, and you watch the whole bar ignite. And as an artist, as a songwriter, it\u2019s like \u2018Man, I want to write a song that makes people\u2019s eyes explode the first chord!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when \u201cUptown Funk\u201d essentially took over all of our lives for a period in time, many astutely noted, \u201cThat motherfucker just remade \u2018Jungle Love!\u2019\u201d Others also pointed to the Gap Band\u2019s \u201cOops Upside Your Head.\u201d There is no record of Morris Day slapping Bruno Mars in retaliation, but Charlie, last name Wilson, and the rest of the Gap Band did smack Bruno and company with a suit\u2014which led to them receiving songwriting credits on the megahit.\n\n\n\nMore recently, even I couldn\u2019t help but call out the Zapp & Roger influences of \u201c24K Magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving said that, while I do think Ndegeocello is correct in pointing out the type of artists and producers who influence Bruno Mars\u2019 most recent hits, I don\u2019t question his sincerity about the kind of product he churns out just because much of it sounds so familiar to tracks of yore.\n\nAs a child, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon grew up performing at dinner theaters, and that very much informs the sort of artist and entertainer he is. That\u2019s why I was tickled when he served as wedding singer for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek\u2019s wedding to Sofia Levander in 2016 because it felt like a return to form. Bruno Mars is more or less the most successful wedding singer ever, or, at the very least, the most successful wedding singer of the modern era.\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to his music, Mars has long been up front not only in his intent when making music but also in praising those who have molded and shaped it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, in a Latina magazine interview, Mars said the following:\n\n\n\nWhen you say \u201cBlack music,\u201d understand that you are talking about rock, jazz, R&B, reggae, funk, doo-wop, hip-hop and Motown. Black people created it all. Being Puerto Rican, even salsa music stems back to the Motherland [Africa]. So, in my world, Black music means everything. It\u2019s what gives America its swag.\n\nSo he acknowledges his intentions, praises those who have helped shaped his sound and, when met with legal challenges, will pay up and move on. As far as pop stars go, that\u2019s most of what you can ask for of them. Beyond that, though, I question whether or not the kind of artist Bruno Mars is and has aimed to be calls for the kind of musicality and \u201coriginality\u201d Ndegeocello is calling him out for (while promoting a covers album, no less).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen reading her interview, it reminded me of the first time I saw Bruno Mars perform as an opening act for Janelle Mon\u00e1e (this is before the two would later tour under his banner in 2011). These two have always been similar to me in that they\u2019re amazing entertainers who have music that registers as intentionally nostalgic. Mon\u00e1e is forward-thinking in terms of her imagery and messaging, but when I\u2019m listening to her actual music, it\u2019s a lot like Bruno\u2019s in that it often makes me think of past works. That\u2019s not a jab; I\u2019m a fan of both. Not every artist is trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\nThere are certainly other critiques to be made about this. Say, why is Bruno Mars winning all of the major awards at the Grammys when the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 are robbed of their honors in these categories or Rihanna is totally snubbed altogether by being left out?

Sure, the blackness for which the city is known is still present symbolically, but ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but white folks at the Brixton, living in the Ellington and hangin\u2019 at Marvin on every other day but Monday and any day in which Rock Creek Social Club isn\u2019t doing an event. It\u2019s almost as if Oprah started handing out white people to neighborhoods in city wards that previously featured levels of blackness that only Bernie Mac as the officer in Don\u2019t Be a Menace 2 South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood could be proud of.\n\nNowhere is this shit more apparent than in the number of curtainless homes running amok in in-town neighborhoods. These homes with big-ass bay windows, especially in the Eckington and Ledroit Park neighborhoods, have been led astray. I don\u2019t know what it is that white people have against privacy, but one sure-as-shit tell that a white person or family has moved into a neighborhood is the lack of security measures or curtains.\n\nThere will be a house with burglar bars and a really design-happy security door and plantation blinds right next door to a home without curtains, bars or ADT signage out front. I\u2019d imagine that even robbers and home invaders\u2014while appreciating the \u201cCome, rob me, stay awhile\u201d invisible sign affixed to those homes\u2014are still wondering if it\u2019s all a big-ass elaborate sting operation. Obviously not enough to NOT rob the home, but at least they\u2019re thinking about it.\n\nThis is what I thought when I read about Amazon.com\u2019s latest attempt to, shit, I don\u2019t know, put Circuit City more out of business with Amazon Key. Amazon Key is a new contraption that would utilize technology to reduce the number of packages that grow legs in cities by creating a mechanism, using both a Cloud Cam and a smart lock, to enable Amazon drivers (no UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc., as of yet) to place that shit you REALLY needed in two days INSIDE your home, all while you watch the entire transaction via your smartphone, tablet or whatever you have.\n\nOn its face, this isn\u2019t a terrible idea. And anybody who lives in neighborhoods where you have to insure every package, like me\u2014I\u2019m currently waving my hands in the air like I just do not care\u2014has thought about how awesome it would be if you didn\u2019t have to try to time getting home to meet the delivery person JUST to make sure you didn\u2019t stumble across an empty box with your name on it halfway down the block.

Shit, back in the day, I got a T-Mobile Sidekick for 10 bucks because the dude I ran up on was quitting his job because he hated his boss that day. That dude? Gave no fucks. Who\u2019s to say how many fucks all of the Amazon folks have?\n\nI remember when my house hired a cleaning service, and the idea was floated to let them motherfuckers have a key so they could come when nobody was home. I heard, \u201cHey, let\u2019s let people come rob us during the day without having to break and enter.\u201d Clearly, that shit never happened.

In order for THAT to be a thing, that means anybody who decides to hack your system can (and will) do that shit. Again with the white shit.

Pompeo would be a troubling choice as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. His hawkish views on Islam are more likely to enable Trump\u2019s Muslim-hating rhetoric, not suppress it.\n\nAs The Atlantic notes, Pompeo has close ties with Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy, who has argued that following Islamic law is \u201can impermissible act of sedition, which has to be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, Pompeo would make a perfect fit for Trump because they are both warmongers. A fierce opponent of the Iran deal, Pompeo said in 2014, while a member of the House of Representatives from Kansas, that military force should be used to halt Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAs disastrous as Tillerson has been, he at least was a voice of calm in quelling the calls for war coming out of the Oval Office. He consistently pushed back against calls for military action in North Korea, saying that diplomacy should be prioritized. Unlike Trump, he supports the Iran deal and is reportedly working behind the scenes to save it. During a hearing on the Hill, Tillerson said that classifying the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror group would complicate peace negotiations in the Middle East.\n\nTillerson\u2019s rhetoric toward Islam is not remotely as inflammatory as Trump\u2019s, and he seems to always be the voice of relative reason in an otherwise xenophobic administration. By comparison, Pompeo has spoken at the Act for America conference (the Southern Poverty Law Center has deemed the organization an anti-Muslim hate group). In 2015 he wrote an op-ed in the Kansas City Star arguing against the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility (and, by the way, Pompeo is a fan of waterboarding, a form of torture). As member of the House Intelligence Committee, Pompeo told Congress in 2013 that Muslim leaders who do not condemn terrorist attacks are \u201cpotentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPompeo basically took the actions of a few and equated them to all Muslims, just like his boss Trump, whose first order of business as president was signing a travel ban for people from certain Muslim countries and who, just last week, retweeted anti-Muslim videos from an Islamophobic political party in the United Kingdom.\n\nA secretary of state is, in fact, a mouthpiece for the president\u2019s foreign policy, but he or she is also supposed to find ways to avoid conflict. Pompeo\u2019s very public anti-Muslim stances make it clear that he is predisposed to seeing Muslims as violent simply because they are Muslim.\n\nMoreover, Pompeo is a pretty awful CIA director who has been accused of being more of an ideologue than a professional intelligence gatherer. When asked if Trump\u2019s Twitter activity makes his job harder during a Q&A Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif., Pompeo said that it actually made his job easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have seen things the president has put on his Twitter account actually have a real-world impact on our capacity to understand what\u2019s going on in other places of the world,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cOur adversaries responded to those tweets in ways that were helpful to us to understand command and control issues, who\u2019s listening to what messages, how those messages are resonating around the world.\u201d\n\nThis man may be our next secretary of state, folks.\n\nIndeed, America has a very destructive history in the Middle East. But Trump\u2019s open hatred for Islam and willingness to appoint as his top diplomat someone who shares those views is arguably a game changer. Pompeo as America\u2019s top diplomat will signal to the world that Trump\u2019s Islamophobia is official U.S. diplomatic policy, a message that far-right extremists the globe over will hail in victory.", "keywords": ["mike", "islam", "tillerson", "muslim", "antimuslim", "secretary", "trump", "rhetoric", "worse", "pompeo", "state", "trumps", "policy", "president"], "polarity": 0.008089410589410576, "subjectivity": 0.3846112221112221},

His legislative failures may be notable, but they pale in comparison with the importance of how he is reshaping the judiciary branch of America\u2019s government at breakneck speed. Donald Trump is filling the federal bench with judges who are overwhelmingly white, \u201calt-right\u201d lite and have no idea what the hell they are doing, and it\u2019s the perfect guide to white supremacy in action.\n\nWhen Donald Trump touts his record number of congressional \u201cwins,\u201d he is lying. He has signed fewer significant pieces of legislation than any recent president. Conversely, the number of federal appeals judges whom he has appointed quadruples the number of appointees confirmed in Barack Obama\u2019s first year. Trump has sent 12 judges to the bench already, compared with Obama\u2019s four. George Bush only had six confirmed, and Trump even beats Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy\u2019s number of 11 appointees, according to Time magazine.\n\nWhat also sets Trump\u2019s nominees apart is their relative youth, inexperience and, most important, their whiteness. Federal appeals court judgeships are lifetime appointments, and the average age of Trump\u2019s nominees is 48 years old. Compare that with the average age of Obama\u2019s appointees during his first term, which was 53, Slate reports. This means that Trump\u2019s judges will probably sit on the bench longer, pleasing his conservative base.\n\nMany federal judges work well into their 80s, meaning that the new young judges could serve through seven presidential terms (when the Sasha Obama-Blue Ivy administration takes office). Tim Head, executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said thanks to Trump and Senate Republicans: \u201cThe federal judiciary is being reshaped for an entire generation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee how that works?\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, 53 of Trump\u2019s 58 nominees are white, and only one is African American. Trump has not nominated a woman of color. That stands in stark contrast with Obama, who made a point of diversifying the federal bench. Only 31 percent of Obama\u2019s first-year appointees were white men. More than two-thirds of Trump\u2019s appointees are white males.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we know that Trump has an affinity to mediocre white men, not only are Trump\u2019s picks white and young\u2014they are unqualified. A full 8 percent of Trump\u2019s picks have been rated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, a mark not seen since the 1960s, according to CNN.\n\nThis number includes Leonard Steven Grasz, who was confirmed to the 8th Circuit despite the fact that no judge with a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating has been confirmed since the Lyndon Johnson administration. It also includes Trump nominee Brett Talley, even though he had never served as a judge, argued a motion or tried a case. And then there was Matthew Petersen, who did this:\n\nEven the nominees who are qualified adhere to the Trump clique\u2019s unique brand of diet racism displayed by Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions. Take Thomas Farr, for instance, whom civil rights leader the Rev. William Barber II called a product of the \u201cmodern white supremacist machine.\u201d Farr began his career working for segregationist and former Sen. Jesse Helms. While employed by Helms, Farr sent postcards to black voters warning them about voting illegally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarr has spent the last decade traveling around the country defending voter restriction and voter-ID laws passed by Republican legislatures. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said that North Carolina\u2019s voter-ID laws targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision,\u201d it was speaking directly to Thomas Farr. So what is Farr\u2019s punishment for losing that case?\n\nHe is the current nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nDespite their shortcomings, racism and whiteness, Senate Republicans are confirming Trump\u2019s nominees at breakneck speed. The Hill reports that GOP lawmakers are considering a change to Senate rules that shortens the amount of time senators can debate a judicial nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does all of this mean for black people? It means that even if Trump is impeached or decides not to run, he may have inextricably changed the judiciary for the next five years. These changes are reflected in how justice is carried out across the country. Voter-ID laws were struck down by federal courts. A federal court ruled against his travel ban.\n\n\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering why Trump would nominate someone to the bench who was as unqualified as these men. Especially someone as obviously incapable as Matthew Petersen, who was nominated to fill the empty seat in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Why does this matter to Trump and, more important, what does he receive in return?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, if the grand jury returns an indictment against Donald Trump, Jared Kushner or any of the people being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s FBI investigation, that case will be heard in\u2014you guessed it\u2014the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nSee how it works?", "keywords": ["administration", "quietly", "number", "white", "shows", "works", "judges", "trump", "district", "winning", "fight", "court", "bench", "federal", "trumps", "nominees", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.08110957261692556, "subjectivity": 0.45513278796367035},

The Root will update you on his condition as details become available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerick Wiley, 35, a 10-year veteran with the Mesquite Police Department in Dallas County, Texas, will face a grand jury on Nov. 28 to determine if he will face criminal charges for the Nov. 8 shooting of Lyndo Jones, 31, Jones\u2019 attorney S. Lee Merritt exclusively shared with The Root.\n\n\n\nWiley is currently on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of two separate investigations into the shooting, one by the Mesquite Police Department and the other by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 8, Jones was sitting inside his vehicle when the car alarm malfunctioned and began blaring. As he struggled to turn it off, someone approached him and asked if he needed assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said that he did not, but that didn\u2019t stop the unidentified person from calling 911 and claiming that Jones was attempting to steal his own vehicle. The 911 call triggered a series of events that ended with Wiley shooting Jones twice in the back even though he was unarmed with his hands raised.\n\nJones was violently searched before being taken into custody and handcuffed to a bed while in critical condition at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was also denied his right to family visitation, according to his legal counsel, criminal defense attorney Justin Moore, who stepped in to represent Jones on behest of civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nMerritt is representing Jones in his civil case against Dallas County and the Mesquite Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Jones was first taken into custody and hospitalized, there were no criminal charges filed against him, which led Moore to investigate why Jones was still technically being held by the Police Department.\n\nDays later, after Moore was forcibly removed from the hospital for insisting that the MPD immediately halt an illegal interrogation of his client, Jones was charged with evading arrest.\n\nAccording to Jones, he requested that his attorney be present for the questioning, but was told by MPD investigators that he didn\u2019t need an attorney because they weren\u2019t there to interrogate him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Brian Parrish, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police Department, insisted during a press conference that questioning Jones without legal counsel present was not in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not being questioned as a suspect but as a \u201cpossible complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my investigators spoke to this individual in the hospital ... it was consensual and it was in reference to him being shot. It was not in reference to any offense he may or may not have committed,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nParrish\u2019s claim runs counter to that of Jones\u2019 attorneys, who were told by guards that Jones would absolutely not be questioned without his lawyers present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed Wiley\u2019s bodycam footage of the shooting, leading District Attorney Faith Johnson to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Jones\u2014on the same day the MPD filed it\u2014and to open a criminal investigation against Wiley.\n\n\n\nJones was finally released on Nov. 15, but according to Parrish, the charge may be revisited.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department claims that Jones \u201cdemonstrated such physical strength that it took three officers just to hold him down until paramedics could arrive at the scene to assess his injuries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that, I\u2019m not an expert on human strength, but I think if someone has been shot and handcuffed and on the ground, and it still takes four large men to hold him down, that might indicate there are other factors in place,\u201d Parrish told local station CBS-DFW.\n\nNot content to play games with the Mesquite Police Department, Merritt, who is representing Jones in his civil case against the MPD, unapologetically admits that his client was high on marijuana and cocaine while sitting in his parked vehicle. Still, he makes it clear that his being high should not give police officers license to shoot unarmed people who are minding their own business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe romanticized search for the perfect victim is futile and dangerous,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cMy client was doing absolutely nothing that warranted this police officer opening fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pre-emptive, transparent vilification of innocent people play out time and time again,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cLyndo Jones is a hardworking father of two young daughters who was profiled by a stranger and shot by Officer Wiley for no reason at all. Wiley is the violent perpetrator here, not my client.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, the Nov. 28 grand jury hearing means nothing in and of itself. What matters, he says, is that Wiley will be charged and convicted of a crime that was not only a willful abuse of his state-sanctioned power but also emblematic of the violence that infests police departments across the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe district attorney [Faith Johnson] has not issued criminal charges against the officer who shot Lyndo Jones twice in the back with his hands up despite abundant probable cause,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cOnly 1 percent of law-enforcement misconduct is prosecuted in the state of Texas. That is by design.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who also represents the family of Jordan Edwards, the 15-year-old boy fatally shot by Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver, says that the grand jury process is tainted and shrouded in secrecy, and only through exposing that truth is reform possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOliver was fired from his job and charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault by a public servant\u2014one charge for each of the young boys in the car with Jordan, including two of his brothers.\n\nThe charges alone against a police officer in Texas are extremely rare, but that is no cause for celebration. There has been no trial, yet; subsequently, there has been no conviction\u2014even though Oliver executed a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecutors make unique exceptions when dealing with police involved malfeasance,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nIn Jones\u2019 case, Wiley\u2019s bodycam allegedly captured the entire incident, and his attorneys are openly encouraging the MPD to release the footage.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the video is highly incriminating against the police officer and my client, and I urge the Mesquite Police Department to be transparent and release it immediately,\u201d Merritt told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious organizations have formed the Coalition for Justice for Lyndo Jones, including Mothers Against Police Brutality, the American Black Cross, the Texas Organizing Project, Friendship-West Baptist Church, the Arlington chapter of the NAACP, the Dallas chapter of the NAACP, Faith-Forward Dallas and Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\n\nClick here to donate to the YouCaring fund established for Jones to assist with medical and legal expenses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to sign the petition urging the Dallas County DA\u2019s Office to issue an arrest warrant for Mesquite Police Officer Derick Wiley.", "keywords": ["department", "jones", "fired", "officer", "jury", "face", "merritt", "attorney", "dallas", "grand", "mesquite", "shooting", "told", "texas", "lyndo", "wiley"], "polarity": 0.04906768837803321, "subjectivity": 0.4688305053822294},

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

Wait, do I have to explain what I mean by \u201cwhite-people shows\u201d? Are people offended? Do I care? I don\u2019t. Never mind. Let me get back to the topic at hand.\n\nSo, yes, I love Sex and the City, which was nothing but white people in New York City and the occasional racial-minority waitress, which means I am quite familiar with the one episode in which Carrie Bradshaw, who was annoying as hell more often than not, married herself in order to reject the needless and sexist shame placed upon single women. However, I didn\u2019t take that episode as something to duplicate in real life. Unfortunately, a few folks have, and no one has had the heart to tell them they look the fool.\n\nAs recently reported, apparently, there is a new term going around: \u201csologamists.\u201d If you\u2019re wondering, indeed, I think it sounds silly, too. In any event, 37-year-old Erika Anderson counts herself as one of these \u201csologamists\u201d and explained its purpose with the following rationale: \u201cI would describe it as women saying yes to themselves. It means that we are enough, even if we are not partnered with someone else.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, basically, she is single and fine with being single. Cool. But did that need a So So Def remix? Moreover, did it require a wedding ceremony, as Anderson recently held in Brooklyn, N.Y.? Spoiler: The answer is no, nah and hell no. Not only did she marry herself, however; she just took herself on a one-year anniversary trip to Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, she took her fake marriage to herself on an anniversary trip. I\u2019m all for solo endeavors like solo vacations and, in this instance, masturbation. However, while there ain\u2019t nothing wrong with making it feel good, baby, it doesn\u2019t require a special new name, beloveds.\n\nAnd because a white person has done some silly shit and gotten media attention for it, let some people tell it, the \u201cmovement has gone global and companies are trying to capitalize.\u201d\n\nLike, in Canada, there is something called Marry Yourself, which offers consulting and wedding photography for your fake-ass, solo-dolo wedding ceremonies. And there is also the San Francisco-based I Married Me. They sell kits, including a wedding band, daily-affirmation cards and vows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI expect a lot of silliness from white folks \u2019cause they have much more disposable income than most. Now, when it comes to \u201cthe blacks,\u201d I have a warning: Don\u2019t you dare engage in this nonsense. Yes, as a member of Future Hive, I believe in the mantra that you do what you want when you popping. Even so, this is dumb and a waste of money.\n\n\n\nI know someone is ready to pounce and accuse me of mansplaining. That ain\u2019t it. In fact, I am a gay, so trust and believe like Keyshia Cole that I anticipate a few gays being allured by this self-indulgent spectacle, too, and probably leaning toward sending me (or someone I know) an Evite to their self-marriage ceremony. Trust and believe that I will mark them as spam in retaliation.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s stupid no matter who does it. I boo-hiss anyone who would do this, and I am equally \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d when it comes to this \u201cmovement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, it can be hard being single, and there are lots of pressures to couple up. I get it, y\u2019all, I do. But again, this is dumb as fuck. It\u2019s dumber than y\u2019all\u2019s president\u2019s tweet. Pick a tweet. Any tweet. It\u2019s dumber than that.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to marry yourself to prove you\u2019re OK with being single. Just masturbate and ignore the world. Tell people to mind their damn business. Let people know that you\u2019re \u201cOkay\u201d like Nivea about your lack of marriage certificate. Doing a self-marrying ceremony screams waste of money, I have too much time on my hands and I am a damn fool.

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

But insiders know there is one part of America\u2019s legal system that has an outsized influence on convictions, sentencing and incarceration:\n\nLocal prosecutors.\n\nHere are a few facts that bear witness to the oft-forgotten power of local prosecutors:\n\nBureau of Justice Statistics (pdf) data shows that 87 percent of all U.S. inmates are housed in state prisons.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, crime and arrests dropped, but incarceration rates rose because prosecutors filed more felony cases.\n\nIf President Donald Trump pardoned every single person in federal prison tomorrow, the number of people incarcerated would only drop from 2.1 million to 1.9 million.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the local prosecutors who drive mass incarceration, and it is the local prosecutors who can end it.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in Philadelphia decided to do something about it when they selected Larry Krasner to be district attorney with nearly 75 percent of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a stunning victory by a man known for taking on civil rights cases and suing the Philadelphia Police Department. Krasner ran on a platform of criminal-justice reform and ending mass incarceration that inspired local activists and made others call him \u201cunelectable.\u201d\n\nBut he is just a prosecutor, not a judge or a legislator, right? What could he do?\n\nKrasner has decided to use his prosecutorial discretion in unprecedented ways. He promised to never ask for cash bail for a nonviolent offender, which is perfectly legal and up to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Cash bail has long been derided as a for-profit system that penalizes poor people before they are convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrasner also vowed to curb police corruption by prosecuting cops with as much zeal as the criminal-justice system targets others. His platform states that he will not prosecute cases where the police are abusive, and the new DA also vowed that he will end the illegal stop-and-frisk program by \u201crefusing to bring to trial cases stemming from illegal frisks and searches.\u201d\n\nThe new prosecutor says that he will no longer seek the death penalty; nor will he seize any defendant\u2019s assets until after a conviction has been made. Krasner also plans to steer cases of drug possession and nonviolent offenses toward treatment programs, and he says that he will seek to end the drug war by treating drug use as a medical problem.\n\nCould this work? Many people think so. It has been done before. Harris County, Texas, instituted a no-cash bail system that freed dozens of low-level nonviolent people who were in jail just because they couldn\u2019t afford to pay their way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014 the district attorney representing Brooklyn, N.Y., decided that he wouldn\u2019t pursue low-level marijuana arrests. Florida prosecutor Aramis Ayala announced that she would stop seeking the death penalty earlier this year, and Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped more than 100 cases after police officers seemingly falsified evidence.\n\nNationwide, more than 90 percent of all criminal convictions are determined by negotiations with prosecutors that result in plea agreements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the thought of an orange totalitarian sleeping in the White House upsets you, when it comes to ending mass incarcerations in your state and community, it is still important to know:\n\nYour vote counts.", "keywords": ["philly", "cases", "mass", "end", "nonviolent", "residents", "proved", "prosecutors", "krasner", "system", "prosecutor", "local", "incarceration", "help", "voting"], "polarity": 0.10910845910845912, "subjectivity": 0.4042997542997543},

The committee has not yet reached a conclusion on whether or not Trump played a part in that plot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommittee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican senator representing North Carolina, told reporters, \u201cThe issue of collusion is still open.\u201d\n\nThese types of investigations are the reason the Senate Intelligence Committee was created. The Senate created the committee in 1976 to basically be the watchdog of the intelligence community. Lawmakers did not create the committee to investigate the news media at the whim of an egomaniacal president who takes it as a slight anytime the news media accurately reports on something questionable that he has said or done.\n\nBesides, there is that whole First Amendment thing, which guarantees us the freedom of the press. It reads, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Trump could actually prove that he was being maliciously defamed by a media organization, there would be legal courses of action he could take, none of which involve the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nBesides, Trump himself could be seen as bending the truth, if we are being fair.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, NBC News published a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been ready to quit his job over the summer and had openly disparaged Trump by calling him \u201ca moron\u201d after a July 20 meeting at the Pentagon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson did not deny calling Trump a moron, and at a press conference he gave shortly after the NBC story ran, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to deal with petty stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump took that and ran with it, writing on Twitter, \u201cThe @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story was not totally refuted; Tillerson did no such thing. Should Tillerson sue Trump for spreading lies about him?\n\nA short time later, Trump followed up that tweet with another that read, \u201cRex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Trump saying that the only good news stories are ones that are verified by him?

It is not incumbent upon us to be the better people in the rare instances when we get to witness a traitor receive his or her comeuppance. We should not be required to take the high road every single time. Reciprocity is not malice. It just is.\n\n\n\nMoreover, our giddiness over the plight of Omarosa isn\u2019t even about Omarosa. She is a medium into which we have channeled our disdain for a racist regime that seeks to place its foot on the neck of nonwhite America. She chose this.\n\nEven though no one can quite figure out exactly what she did as White House Office of Public Liaison communications director, whatever small role she played in the Trump administration means that she was an enabler of a regime that is blatantly anti-black. She was a friend of black America\u2019s enemy, which, by definition, made her an enemy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe accepted her $179,000-per-year salary and paraded around in front of black America as if she were anything but a sock puppet at whom the Trump administration pointed when they explained that they couldn\u2019t be racist because they had a black friend. She wasn\u2019t drafted. She was a free agent who freely decided to jump on the bandwagon of the team that excused white supremacist terrorists, traded in Islamophobia and used anti-immigrant sentiment to gain power. Now that the team has issued her walking papers and given her instructions on where she should avoid letting the doorknob hit, we should not feel sorry for singing, \u201cNa na na na, hey hey hey ... goodbye!\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t feel bad about rejoicing over Omarosa\u2019s misfortune. Be petty. Laugh at her when you spot her at the unemployment office.

In 2016 a Supreme Court decision made the 2012 ruling apply retroactively, yet the state of Louisiana continues to push back and fight against giving juvenile offenders an opportunity at parole.\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that according to the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights, prosecutors in the state are trying to block too many juvenile murderers from having a chance at parole\u2014which means the state may not be in compliance with the high court ruling.\n\nLouisiana district attorneys have tried to block, or have already successfully blocked, about one-third of the juvenile murderers who meet the state\u2019s requirement of having served 25 years and completed educational programming to qualify for parole.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, only juveniles who are considered \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d and incapable of being rehabilitated should be sentenced to life without parole\u2014and those should be rare cases. Based on that, Jill Pasquarella\u2014who is an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights\u2014told Nola.com that it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in the state would meet the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d\n\nBecause prosecutors have challenged the parole eligibility of so many juvenile lifers, Pasquarella said that the state will be headed back to court\u2014which will cost the already cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands of more dollars. In addition to the cost of funding a second defense of the state law, in some cases, the state will have to pay the lawyers that represent the juvenile lifers in these cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete Adams is the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, and he acknowledges that the state is probably headed back to court, but he says the Supreme Court needs to add more clarity to what \u201cworst of the worst\u201d means with regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n\u201cEventually the U.S. Supreme Court will say what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not,\u201d Adams told Nola.com. \u201cIf the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can\u2019t get it, we will abide by that.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, when the Supreme Court did make its ruling in 2012, Louisiana answered that by creating a law that only gave access to parole to juvenile lifers who had been sentenced after 2012\u2014not those who were already in prison at that time. A juvenile lifer challenged the Louisiana law, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the state clarification and said it needed to give juvenile lifers who were already locked up a chance at parole as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to that, during the 2017 legislative session, the Louisiana law was rewritten so that beginning this month (November), juvenile lifers who have served 25 years and meet other requirements, such as obtaining a high school diploma equivalent, would have a shot at parole. The new law leaves room for prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer\u2019s access to parole through a special hearing.\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, run by Leon Cannizzarro, has reviewed the cases of 64 juveniles serving life for murder\u2014more than any other district attorney in the state. The office has filed motions to block 32 of those cases from parole eligibility.\n\nThose 32 cases count in the number that makes up the one-third of the total cases in the state in which the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights says state prosecutors are seeking to challenge parole access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Dan Claitor (R-Baton Rouge)\u2014who sponsored this year\u2019s revised juvenile lifer legislation\u2014conceded that the state\u2019s numbers don\u2019t look good when it comes to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cI would have to agree\u2014if those numbers are correct\u2014it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,\u201d Claitor said. \u201cI just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.", "keywords": ["juvenile", "lifers", "despite", "worst", "cases", "la", "ruling", "district", "court", "parole", "supreme", "working", "seeking", "state", "louisiana", "law"], "polarity": -0.08184300993124521, "subjectivity": 0.45011713776419665},

To date, Kardashian and her merry band of familial pirates have stolen black women\u2019s hips, asses, lips, eyelashes, men, style, behaviors, ethos, attitude and demeanor, and, then, with the audacity of Rachel Dolezal, Kim, the point guard of the family, had the nerve to subtweet black women who pointed out to her that she was wearing cornrows, not some dumbass \u201cBo Derek braids.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand the idea of wanting to dismiss Kim and the Kardashian clan, including the one fully white one who now looks Armenian, but I also understand the historical plight of black women who\u2019ve been erased from history.\n\nMonday night\u2019s Twitter trolling of black women wasn\u2019t some new low (for Kim, the spoon has been stirring in this tea cup for some time), the subtweet actually signified a larger undoing\u2014she really doesn\u2019t give a shit. And the issue with this is that this silicone-injected butt with a working mouth has gone rogue, very rogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is Kanye.\n\nKanye West is Kim\u2019s black husband and therefore her guide into black life. It\u2019s his job to explain to his wife why what she\u2019s been doing and continues to do is not only wrong, it\u2019s also hurtful, to black women. But don\u2019t expect Kanye to say anything anytime soon because we\u2019ve lost Kanye to a fate that has ruined many a black man before him: \u201cthe sunken place,\u201d aka Kim Kardashian\u2019s vagina. Reggie Bush, Kris Humphries, one of the little Jackson boys, some producer dude and Ray J have all fallen victim.\n\nReggie Bush could\u2019ve been the next Walter Payton. Kris Humphries could\u2019ve been the next Karl Malone. That little Jackson boy probably wasn\u2019t going to hit it big, and neither was that producer dude. But Ray J was not supposed to be the comical moped owner. Need I remind y\u2019all of this?\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure how to tell the brothers who fall for this act what\u2019s what, but adding a fake butt onto a regular woman is like putting nice rims on a Honda Accord. Yet the Kardashians remain modern-day quicksand for certain black men, and no matter how many times black women warn them that a Kardashian move isn\u2019t a good look; no matter how many men come out of the wringer more worse for wear, there\u2019s another black man standing off to the side like, \u201cHold my warmup jacket.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor these men, who routinely choose an obvious trap, the value-add has to be the white gaze. For them, the acceptance of their white plastic counterpart is like bitcoin; they don\u2019t fully understand it, but they know that they value it more than hard cash. They long for it.\n\nSad to say, but Kanye has been fawning for white approval for some time now. He wants desperately to be seen as the modern-day Steve Jobs and Walt Disney. He wants desperately to be accepted by the major fashion houses like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. He longs to be categorized among America\u2019s great whites, so much so that he\u2019s allowed himself to become the fawned-over black addition to the Kardashian circus.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen Kim\u2019s impact on Kanye\u2014the recluse who\u2019s had a nervous breakdown, yet also produced a fat-dad clothing line called \u201cCalabasas\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve not seen Kanye\u2019s impact on Kim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is partly because the Kardashian machine never changes. It runs on likes and retweets and other vapid forms of approval. It is all the stuff that all the psychologists have ever written about the id and the superego, all snapshot into one Instagram post. The machine stays the machine; the only changes happen to those who fall within its purview.\n\nIf you expected the bullish and outspoken Kanye to change the Kardashian template to look like an original forward-thinking woman who stopped pillaging the soul of black women, then you were wrong.\n\n\n\nWhile Kanye, an actual master craftsman masquerading as a genius, adds a legitimacy to Kim\u2019s Frankenstein-esque concoction, he doesn\u2019t seem to add a voice. I don\u2019t know where he is while his Armenian-and-white wife openly trolls black Twitter. I don\u2019t know what happened to the self-proclaimed mama\u2019s boy raised by a strong black woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier Kanye rapped, \u201cWhen he get on, he\u2019ll leave your ass for a white girl,\u201d and later Kanye did just that, but I didn\u2019t expect him to lose his voice.\n\nWhere\u2019s the gangster Kanye who stormed the stage to silence Taylor Swift with praise for Beyonc\u00e9? Where is the Kanye who said, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d? Where is the Kanye who once claimed, \u201cKim doesn\u2019t understand what a blessing I am to her\u201d?\n\nThen bless her, Kanye, with the knowledge of appropriation. Bless her with the history of the slave trade. Tell her about the time Venus Williams had a point taken from her during the 1999 Australian Open because the beads from her braids kept falling onto the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I know that I\u2019m asking a lot.

He\u2019s aligned himself with the hatred held by poor, white, middle and Southern Americans to motivate them to the polls, and every now and then, he throws them a bone to remind them that he\u2019s still a leader in hate.\n\n\n\nNot celebrating Eid al-Fitr with a dinner at the White House is just that. It\u2019s a presidential bone to xenophobes who openly hate Muslims, and a reassurance that Trump is still a xenophobe-in-chief who openly hates Muslims.\n\nThe White House had held a Eid al-Fitr feast, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, every year since President Bill Clinton\u2019s tenure. However, current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly rejected a request to hold a reception, the BBC reports.\n\nDespite numerous studies that show that America\u2019s biggest terrorists have always been and arguably always will be white men, the demagogue-in-chief continues to lead his tribe down a path of hate\u2014pushing black-on-black violence, or \u201cthe scary Muslim myth\u201d\u2014because this is what he does.\n\nOne thing about Trump that remains consistent is his hate. He hates anything not white. His campaign into the White House was soaked in anti-Muslim rhetoric. Currently, the Supreme Court is deciding on the constitutionality of the president\u2019s proposed Muslim travel ban. Trump even went so far as to request surveillance of U.S.-based mosques, the BBC reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president did issue an empty statement as a hollow gesture to celebrate the end of Ramadan.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the American people, Melania and I send our warm greetings to Muslims as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr,\u201d the statement reads, the BBC reports. It continues:\n\n\n\nMuslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity. Now, as they commemorate Eid with family and friends, they carry on the tradition of helping neighbors and breaking bread with people from all walks of life. During this holiday, we are reminded of the importance of mercy, compassion and goodwill. With Muslims around the world, the United States renews our commitment to honor these values. Eid Mubarak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the easiest ways to know that the president had nothing to do with this statement is that nothing was misspelled. It also didn\u2019t mention Hillary Clinton or her emails.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t hold Eid dinner because he is openly a horrible person, and part of me believes that\u2019s a good thing, because all of us nonwhite people know where we stand with this administration and its mission to \u201cMake America hate again.\u201d\n\nRead more at the BBC.", "keywords": ["muslims", "muslim", "dinner", "white", "heres", "trump", "donald", "eid", "bbc", "ended", "tradition", "openly", "house", "statement", "president"], "polarity": -0.10395622895622895, "subjectivity": 0.4223905723905724},

Brunell has worked with Republicans in support of their gerrymandering efforts and believes that the census overrepresents black Americans.\n\nIn fact, Brunell wrote a book advocating the use of gerrymandering, Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America, published in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Newsweek highlights, Brunell\u2019s appointment could imperil the rights of people of color in America. The business of counting everyone who lives within America\u2019s borders\u2014who they are and where they are\u2014is essential in informing state and federal voting districts, as well as determining how to distribute local, state and federal resources. A chief concern is that Trump would weaponize the census, using it to attack voting rights and immigrants\u2014and Brunell\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 implies that he\u2019d be happy to carry out his boss\u2019s marching orders.\n\nVoting rights advocates fear how Brunell could influence the undercounting of African Americans, especially given his previous work. The professor has opposed early voting, for instance, which favors black Americans as well as working-class Americans. The GOP has also used Brunell\u2019s reports or testimony in multiple lawsuits filed against them for unfairly redrawing voting districts on political and racial lines.\n\nIn his book on gerrymandering, Brunell argued that stacking Democrats and Republicans in like-minded districts leads to better representation from elected officials because it means that fewer citizens vote for the losing candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration also wants to add a separate question about citizenship that could dramatically reduce Latinx response rates out of fear that the feds would use that data to target them. A Middle Eastern and North African, or MENA, racial category has also been proposed\u2014a move that had been advocated by many people of MENA ancestry prior to Trump\u2019s election. Given Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim and anti-Arab rhetoric, though, it\u2019s likely that they, too, would be discouraged from reporting their racial backgrounds on the 2020 census because of worries about immigration crackdowns.\n\nAs with many other Trump government picks, Brunell is spectacularly unprepared to serve as the top operational official at the Census Bureau. He has no administrative experience and little experience with federal statistics\u2014both essential elements of the job. As Politico notes, the role typically goes to a nonpolitical career civil servant with a background in statistics. Meanwhile, Brunell\u2014gerrymandering\u2019s No. 1 fan\u2014is a registered Republican.\n\n\n\nBrunell\u2019s appointment does not require congressional approval and could come as early as this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Politico and Newsweek.", "keywords": ["census", "experience", "racial", "brunell", "black", "pick", "thinks", "professor", "progerrymandering", "trump", "rights", "overcounted", "federal", "trumps", "head", "voting"], "polarity": 0.09086229086229088, "subjectivity": 0.406016731016731},

People can twist statistics to fit any narrative. When debating race, some skeptics (usually white people, racists and black men with no facial hair) are willing to easily dismiss your assertions if you don\u2019t have peer-reviewed, scientific proof. Pulling out data from a study during a debate about racial injustice is like licking the big joker and sticking it to your forehead.\n\nNot only are there disparities in arrests, prosecution, sentencing and incarceration between blacks and whites, but a new study has revealed that even when defendants are willing to plead guilty to a crime, prosecutors will still offer black defendants much harsher plea deals than their white counterparts.\n\nCarlos Berdej\u00f3, a researcher at Loyola University, recently completed a study entitled \u201cCriminalizing Race: Racial Disparities in Plea Bargaining\u201d (pdf), which highlights the racial disparities in the criminal-justice system by examining the differences in the way prosecutors handle misdemeanor crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not the felonies that often saddle black and brown people with criminal records, fines and jail sentences. Law-enforcement officers and prosecutors charge defendants with misdemeanor crimes more often, and these charges receive less focus because of a number of factors, including the severity of the alleged offense, the salaciousness of the details and the lack of public outcry.\n\nBerdej\u00f3 looked at misdemeanor crimes in Wisconsin. He focused on the state because of the wealth of detailed information that state includes in its data, including the race, gender, age and criminal history of the defendant. Wisconsin also has a plea bargaining process that is not guided by mandatory maximums or minimums, which means that the sentences and punishment are almost always left up to the discretion of prosecutors and judges.\n\nHe examined 30,807 cases over a seven-year period and found a number of disturbing facts, in almost every phase of the criminal-justice system. The study determined biases in arrests, sentencing and the types of plea deals that were offered, and it found several, including these:\n\nWhite people facing misdemeanor charges were more than 74 percent more likely than black people to have all charges carrying potential prison time dropped, dismissed or reduced.\n\n\n\nWhite people with no criminal history were more than 25 percent more likely to have charges reduced than black people who also had no criminal history.\n\n\n\nBlack defendants were 19.38 percentage points more likely than white defendants to be incarcerated.\n\n\n\nBlack offenders, on average, received sentences 1.23 months longer than those given to whites.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is the plea bargaining process that exposes the differences in the way the justice system criminalizes blacks suspected of committing crimes. The data shows that whites were 74.9 percent more likely to see the magnitude of their misdemeanor crimes lessened, and 25 percent more likely than blacks to have their misdemeanor charges reduced, dropped or amended.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut aren\u2019t blacks more crime prone? That\u2019s probably why they get harsher penalties.\u201d\n\nNot according to Berdej\u00f3\u2019s research. In the cases where the defendant had no prior convictions, white defendants were 46 percent more likely to have their charges reduced or erased than \u201cthe blacks.\u201d The statistics hold true even when researchers controlled for the type of crime, the quality of the attorney and the experience of the prosecutor. In other words, when Berdej\u00f3 examined every variable that could explain the racism in the criminal-justice system, blacks still received harsher sentences and got worse deals than whites when they pleaded guilty to crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of this study are consequential for three reasons:\n\nProsecutorial discretion: Wisconsin law allows prosecutors and judges to determine plea bargains and deals. The research shows that when they\u2019re given the latitude, the actors inside the criminal-justice system will always produce racially biased results.\n\nEconomic impact: The fines and penalties associated with these crimes affect entire communities. The inability to pay could land you in jail. It means that black families are more likely to lose a potential earner because black parents are incarcerated more often and longer than whites. Furthermore, convictions for misdemeanors and felonies affect the ability to get financial aid for education, employment opportunities and earning potential. The criminalization of African Americans: The study shows that black people are more likely to be arrested for committing the same crimes. Blacks receive longer prison sentences. Blacks get their charges dropped or reduced less often. All of these facts show how blacks are criminalized and viewed as more dangerous, even when the pool with which they are compared consists of white criminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure none of this comes as a surprise to anyone reading this, but the next time some \u201calt-right\u201d-leaning fart bubble starts explaining how blacks make up so much of the prison population, commit so many crimes or don\u2019t work, or presents some other insidious stereotype that is selectively remembered by your I\u2019m-not-racist-I\u2019m-just-looking-at-the-facts friend, slam this study on the table and remind that person that whiteness is, and will always be, America\u2019s trump card.\n\nRead the entire study here (pdf).", "keywords": ["defendants", "crimes", "phase", "misdemeanor", "yall", "criminaljustice", "black", "favors", "white", "study", "plea", "blacks", "charges", "system", "whites", "told", "reveals", "likely"], "polarity": 0.07264019505398815, "subjectivity": 0.47224254034598856},

If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

The letters, which come from the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, have also found the prestigious university to be \u201cout of compliance\u201d with federal law.\n\nThe Justice Department is also threatening to sue Harvard if the school doesn\u2019t hand over documents it has asked for by Dec. 1. Harvard has said that it has complied to the best of its ability but cannot compromise confidential and sensitive student records for the sake of the DOJ\u2019s hunt.\n\nThe new documents confirm earlier reports that the DOJ was actively investigating complaints lodged against Harvard University by Asian-American applicants who claim that they were denied admissions based on their race. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students relatively static year after year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conservative legal strategist behind the suit, Edward Blum, has had his sights set on blowing up a series of key civil-rights-era laws. Blum, who is not an attorney, successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, though he lost last year\u2019s Supreme Court challenge to affirmative action against the University of Texas.\n\nNow it appears that the DOJ wants to take the suit, and the resentment of a handful of Asian and Asian-American college applicants, and dismantle affirmative action as we know it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanita Gupta, who led the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration (before the department felt like some terrible play at irony), told CNN that Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u201cclearly appears to be on the hunt for a case to bring a significant challenge to affirmative action.\u201d\n\nThe original suit, as well as the DOJ\u2019s obsession with Harvard\u2019s admissions practices, ignores several important factors. If Asian Americans suffered disproportionately, it would also mean that less worthy white applicants also benefited\u2014a fact that doesn\u2019t square with anti-affirmative-action rhetoric that focuses almost exclusively on black and Latinx students.\n\nAsians and Asian Americans are also disproportionately represented in Harvard\u2019s student body in comparison with their national numbers: Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021 is 22.2 percent Asian and Asian American\u2014the highest percentage ever for that group (African Americans make up 14.6 percent), according to the Mercury News. Asians make up 5.6 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore important, buying into the belief that Asian-American students disproportionately suffer because of their race implies that admissions applications between students are one-to-one comparisons. Simply switch an applicant\u2019s race, and suddenly the result changes! That view ignores how complex the admissions process has become, hinging on a variety of scores, qualifications, requirements and factors.\n\nLast year\u2019s Supreme Court decision alluded to this in the high court\u2019s defense of allowing race to factor into admissions decisions; it is but one of many qualities that colleges take into consideration when reviewing which students would be the best fit for their school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent report from The Atlantic highlighted this complexity. The city or town from which a student hails, his or her record of service, and whether the candidate is a first-generation college student or descends from a legacy of alumni all contribute to admissions decisions, yet there is little to no legal hand-wringing about how these factors come into play.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that recent studies indicate that Asians Americans, as a whole, have benefited from and support affirmative action programs. This isn\u2019t about protecting a certain group of students\u2014it\u2019s about using Asians as a cover to resurrect a white supremacist policy.\n\nAs this excellent NPR piece points out, white Americans have long used this myth of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d as a wedge to keep Asians and other people of color from seeking broader alignment and cooperation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs these documents indicate, the DOJ is ready to turn this wedge into a hammer.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["documents", "department", "justice", "americans", "harvard", "practices", "student", "asian", "students", "threatens", "affirmative", "racebased", "suit", "harvards", "race", "admissions", "sue"], "polarity": 0.16241018931317433, "subjectivity": 0.4479196549718937},

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\n\u201cWe felt that this was an issue over the last months, as we have continued to work with our players on issues of equality and on issues of criminal-justice reform, that was surfaced for us, and we thought it was appropriate to lend our support to it,\u201d Lockhart told reporters, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut it\u2019s the timing of the endorsement that\u2019s most striking. The league is still desperately trying to move past the controversy surrounding player protests against racial injustice and police brutality during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL\u2019s action also comes just a day after news broke that former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick is filing a grievance against the NFL\u2019s owners for collusion.\n\nKaepernick is widely (and justly) credited for bringing social and racial issues to the fore when he began sitting\u2014then taking a knee\u2014during the national anthem. Since then, other players have taken up Kaepernick\u2019s mantle, both on and off the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhiladelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins, former Baltimore Raven Anquan Boldin and Detroit Lion Glover Quin have all spoken to Congress on the issue of police and criminal-justice reform within the past year.\n\nIt\u2019s only now, with the endorsement of the Grassley-Durbin bill, that the league itself has decided to take any action.\n\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t taken any position on the bill, though it directly contradicts Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 instructions to federal prosecutors earlier this year that they pursue maximum sentences for drug offenses. In fact, despite having broad bipartisan support, the Grassley-Durbin bill has failed to reach the Senate floor. Key Senate Republicans, along with the Klu Klux Keebler himself, have opposed the bill, and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring the measure to the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what impact the league\u2019s endorsement could have on the bill\u2019s passage, but the timing raises questions, to say the least. While individual players have called for criminal-justice and police reform, the Post reports that the league has only recently gotten involved with the legislation:\n\nBut a spokesman for Grassley added that the NFL had not coordinated with the bill\u2019s congressional sponsors in advance of its decision. In the meantime, no other sports league has signed on. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association did not immediately return a call for comment about whether the football players\u2019 union would also endorse the bill.\ufeff\n\n\n\nThe NFL\u2019s endorsement and its timing rings of other PR-oriented moves the league has made in response to a crisis. After video circulated of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice clocking his then-fiancee in the face, the league doubled down on punishments for players accused of domestic violence.

That discussion is too subjective, and no one will ever reach a consensus on any kind of art. Plus, some people have shit taste in music, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m about to argue music with anyone who believes 21 Savage is better than Nas.\n\nFor the sake of this argument, Bruno Mars is not black. He has a mixed racial background that includes Ashkenazi Jew, Puerto Rican and Filipino. One can debate where he fits in the African Diaspora, the meaning of \u201cblackness\u201d or whether race is an artificial construct. I can almost guarantee that if I called him right now and asked him to list his top five macaroni-makers, he\u2019d have to think about it for a minute, and none of the names in his top five would begin with the word \u201caunt.\u201d Black people created every form of American music. But there is a specific, indefinable genre of music that begins with R&B and encompasses hip-hop that we will heretofore refer to as \u201cblack music.\u201d\n\nThe furious debate about Bruno Mars and whether or not he is a cultural appropriator has bubbled beneath the surface of his career for a while. It existed before he remade Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk\u201d or Bell Biv DeVoe\u2019s \u201cFinesse.\u201d Even when\u2014\n\nWait ... I\u2019m being told that the previously mentioned songs are Bruno Mars originals. But I\u2019m pretty sure the S.O.S. Band made \u201c24 Karat Magic.\u201d I think it was the B side to \u201cTake Your Time,\u201d so let\u2019s use that as an example. What? That\u2019s an original song, too? OK, I\u2019m going to have to do a little more research on this and get back to you.\n\nBut before Bruno won a Grammy and Meshell Ndegeocello called him a karaoke singer, there were always people who thought that someone put Michael Jackson, Prince and James Brown into a blender with a quarter cup of lukewarm water, a dollop of mayonnaise and a smidge of racial ambiguity, and out came the next pop sensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation was reignited when this clip from the Grapevine (not this one; the other one) began circling the internet:\n\nSeren Aishitemasu, the woman in the clip makes a convincing argument breaking down why Bruno is a derivative artist who\u2014willingly or not\u2014gets to trade on his racial ambiguity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut does that necessarily mean he is guilty of cultural appropriation?\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of the term, but it generally relates to the use of the art, artifacts, symbology or anything of cultural significance to a minority or nondominant group of people by a person who is not in that group.\n\nWhat separates cultural appropriation from a cultural exchange or paying homage is when someone \u201cborrows\u201d an item or symbol of cultural significance without acknowledgment, attribution or permission. One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding the definition and the power dynamics involved in cultural appropriation is the key to understanding the concept. When Kim Kardashian put cornrows in her hair and called them \u201cBo Derek braids,\u201d it was cultural appropriation because she made no acknowledgment of the culture from which the style came.\n\nAnd yes, black people can be cultural appropriators. When a black woman wore a Native American headdress to Coachella as a costume, she was appropriating by using part of a culture\u2019s sacred ritual as cosplay. In fact, I am often accused of cultural appropriation. When people ask how I can use the white man\u2019s internet and type on a keyboard that a white man invented and not be considered an appropriator, I want to explain to them how stupid they sound, but I don\u2019t because they probably wouldn\u2019t understand the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when it comes to music and art, cultural appropriation is a tricky thing to decipher. A non-black person\u2019s involvement in a traditionally black art does not rise to the level of appropriation in and of itself. Bruno Mars is 32 years old, meaning that he grew up during a time when hip-hop and R&B ruled the charts as the most popular music in the world. Anyone making popular music in 2018 is\u2014by definition\u2014making black music, regardless of their color.\n\nTo be honest, it is incumbent on white artists to acknowledge that, even if it seems unfair.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is only doing what Janet Jackson did before her and Diana Ross did before her. But Beyonc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to bear the burden of acknowledging that every time she steps onstage because\u2014as a black woman\u2014she is an inheritor of that legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when Taylor Swift makes an album that looks like an unsweetened, gluten-free version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, it comes off as cultural appropriation, even though it is quite possible that Taylor Swift was influenced by the same artists as Queen Bey (although, judging from the fact that Swift looks like she\u2019s doing trigonometry in her head when she\u2019s doing dance choreography, I doubt it).\n\nSome might call it a double standard or reverse racism to demand that Swift and other white artists give a nod to borrowing from black music and culture while not requiring the same of black artists. However, being black means you are born into the legacy of the culture. I can walk into my grandmother\u2019s house and open the refrigerator without asking permission. You cannot.\n\nBut here is the fault line:\n\nBeing a part of a culture\u2014whether one is born into it or not\u2014also comes with the responsibility of being a caretaker of it. If we kept our mouths closed, non-blacks artists would suck our artistic heritage dry without caring what happened to whomever they left in the discarded heap. We gave Justin Timberlake a 2-decade get-out-of-appropriation-free pass. When he was finished doing his 20-years-long impression of an R&B singer, he became a \u201cMan of the Woods\u201d and distanced himself from black music like it was Janet Jackson\u2019s left titty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are black artists who have leaped to Bruno Mars\u2019 defense, saying that he is not guilty of appropriation. As someone who is only marginally aware of his music, every time I have seen him perform, give an interview or receive an award, including the Grammy, he has made sure to acknowledge that he was influenced by black music almost exclusively.\n\nSo, based on the definition of cultural appropriation, is Bruno Mars guilty?\n\nNope.\n\nEvery single word Seren said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I have a theory about the people who accuse Bruno Mars of cultural theft:\n\nMaybe they are tired of seeing people like Post Malone take bits of black culture and use them to make derivative, unoriginal content meant to be palatable for white mouths. Perhaps they are tired of seeing more-talented black artists outshone by beige newcomers who pass the paper-bag test and don\u2019t give white people the heebie-jeebies. It is possible that they are overzealous custodians of their culture.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars. Maybe they saw his act when Janelle Mon\u00e1e was doing the same thing for the past decade. Maybe they saw Bruno when he was Chris Brown. Or Bobby Brown. Or James Brown. Or MC Hammer. Or Prince. Or Michael Jackson. Or Janet Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, even if he is always careful to give props, maybe they understand that Kenny G is the best-selling jazz instrumentalist in the modern era, Eminem is the best-selling hip-hop artist of all time and there isn\u2019t a black face in the top five best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nBut they all make black music.\n\nTrust me, they know it.", "keywords": ["dont", "bruno", "controversy", "black", "artists", "doing", "white", "culture", "proves", "understand", "mars", "music", "appropriation", "cultural"], "polarity": 0.02780663780663778, "subjectivity": 0.41541666666666666},

I read an article today about him in GQ where he was asked, \u201cDo you, Post Malone, ever feel anxious about working in a primarily black-identified genre of music?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer, Bijan Stephen, even noted his own feelings about Malone\u2019s hypocrisy when he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m black. I\u2019m young. I\u2019ve been put off by some of the things he\u2019s said about distancing himself from rap, from R&B, from anything, really, that\u2019s musically black-identified.\u201d\n\nStephen went on to explain: \u201cI enjoy Post\u2019s music, but I\u2019m skeptical: What\u2019s worse than appropriating a black sound without giving appropriate credit is doing that and not realizing why that might be wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Lord, you are the alpha and omega, and being that you are the only one in heaven or on earth who pledged two fraternities, I\u2019m sure you already knew this, our bright and morning star. In your omnipotence, I\u2019m sure you are aware of Post Malone\u2019s response, but Imma just type it out so the copyedit team won\u2019t ask me for the quote, Almighty One. Oh, ye Giver of Life, Death and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Post Malone said:\n\nI definitely feel like there\u2019s a struggle being a white rapper. But I don\u2019t want to be a rapper. I just want to be a person that makes music. I make music that I like and I think that kicks ass, that I think the people who fuck with me as a person and as an artist will like.\n\nOh, Lord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to still this slapping spirit that is rising in my heart and tingling in my palms!

I felt the same thing when I read that quote from Post Malone, and I need you to eject this reneging spirit from my soul, Most High!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, Big Poppa (yes, I\u2019ve heard the gospel hymn when you said you love it when we call you that), take Post Malone\u2019s hand and guide him through the misery of being a millionaire and being white. I know it must be hard for him to exist in a world where he has every societal advantage that comes with whiteness while simultaneously getting to wade in the pool of black culture.\n\nI imagine it tastes like fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good, Evil and White Privilege. Yea, though Post Malone walks through the valley of the shadow of cultural appropriation, comfort him with your rod and staff. Or beat him.\n\nPlease beat him.\n\nAnd forgive him, Your Highness.\n\nForgive him, for he knows not what he\u2019s doing when he makes millions from an art form created by black people while distancing himself from the individuals and the struggle that birthed the art by stiff-arming anything remotely related to blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive him for dabbling in the outlaw-thug stereotype while not recognizing the privilege of not having every aspect of himself associated with the oppression and danger that goes along with his inverted shucking and jiving.\n\nOh, my Good & Plenty higher power, I know some will say that he is not guilty of cultural appropriation, but if hip-hop is a culture, and the definition of appropriation is \u201cthe deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art\u201d without attribution or acknowledgment, and Malone doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that he is a rapper, then I don\u2019t know what else to call him, dear Lord. A rap gentrifier? A rhyme colonialist? Motherfucker? (Forgive me for that, thou divine one.)\n\nBut most of all, ye magnificent with the sensational style, forgive Post Malone for his tone-deaf, oblivious whining about the paper-cut-deep criticism he receives for his third-grade-level lyrical, gold-front blackface as if he couldn\u2019t stop rapping tomorrow, waltz his ass back to the suburbs, and become the one thing in the world that is greater and exponentially more precious than being a young, famous, millionaire musician:\n\nA white man.\n\nIn this, and all things, we ask your blessings.\n\nAmen.", "keywords": ["dont", "im", "lord", "know", "sure", "black", "struggle", "white", "rapper", "malone", "prayer", "post"], "polarity": 0.13341600529100528, "subjectivity": 0.5150589726631394},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

During an interview with Fox Business Network that aired Wednesday, TrumPutin was asked about the Obama administration\u2019s hold over FBI Director James Comey, the New York Daily News reports.\n\n\n\nOf course, TrumPutin found a way to make it all about Clinton because he\u2019s obsessed with her. At this point, TrumPutin is Chris Brown and Clinton is his Karrueche Tran.\n\n\u201cDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton. If he weren\u2019t, she would be going to trial,\u201d TrumPutin said about the FBI director\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s reported use of private emails while handling confidential information.\n\n\n\nTrumPutin clearly misinterpreted Comey\u2019s July testimony before Congress in which he said that the FBI wouldn\u2019t prosecute Clinton or members of her team for the alleged email mishap. \u201cWhen he [Comey] was reading those charges, she was guilty of every one,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin did add that it wasn\u2019t too late for him to remove Comey from his position, but noted that \u201cI have confidence in him.\u201d\n\nThe dictator in chief dismissed whether or not he would pursue charges against Clinton, noting that he only wanted to talk about \u201cpositive things.\u201d\n\nMan, this president is batshit crazy. First off, he brings up Clinton when no one was talking about her; makes all of these false claims, as this administration has been known to do; and then, when he claims that she is guilty of all these charges, he doesn\u2019t want to talk about charging her because that is not \u201cpositive\u201d topics. He\u2019s really good at being a shithead and shifting the conversation so that he can make unsubstantiated claims about a person\u2019s character without repercussion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrumPutin is still trying to undo Obamacare because of course he is. At this point, Obamacare is the tattoo on his new girlfriend that reminds him of her ex. It doesn\u2019t even say the ex\u2019s name, but it\u2019s there from a time when they dated, and being the controlling dirtbag that he is, he wants it gone.\n\n\u201cHealth care is going to happen at some point,\u201d Trump said, adding that it had to come before tax reform, the Daily News reports. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first.\u201d\n\nLastly, the president tried to talk about ongoing tensions with Russia and North Korea, but it\u2019s so hard to listen to this guy talk. He\u2019s sounds like a kid trying to answer a homework question when he didn\u2019t read the assigned chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s meeting with Russia\u2019s top diplomat over the country\u2019s continued support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who\u2019s accused of launching a chemical weapon attack last week on his own people, TrumPutin had this to say: \u201cI think it\u2019s very bad for Russia. I think it\u2019s very bad for mankind. If Russia didn\u2019t go in and back this animal, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem right now.\u201d\n\nAnd on North Korea, TrumPutin gave this eloquent soliloquy: \u201cWe are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people.

That means that nearly 60,000 Haitians will have until July 22, 2019, to leave the country they call home.\n\n\u201cThis is criminal,\u201d says Farah Larrieux of Miami. Larrieux came to the U.S. in 2005 and qualified for TPS in 2010.

Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)\u2014introduced bipartisan legislation, the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 (pdf), which would permanently resolve the status of the nearly 300,000 TPS recipients from Haiti, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central America. With the bill\u2019s passage, recipients who\u2019ve been in the country at least five years would be eligible to apply for permanent residency under a new protected status.\n\n\n\nHaiti and Central American nations like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras are some of this hemisphere\u2019s most economically depressed, politically unstable and violent countries. These nations also share unique histories of U.S. involvement in their political and socioeconomic development that Bastien says cannot be ignored. The U.S. occupied Haiti between 1915 and 1934 and has played substantial military and financial roles in previous dictatorships and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot try to limit migration without taking responsibility for creating conditions that force people from their homelands in the first place.

You can\u2019t have it both ways. \u201d\n\nBastien says that\u2019s why many Haitian TPS holders are those who migrated even before the earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010. Some recipients fled violence and political instability years before. Bastien says that many of her clients have been in the country for decades and have American-born children.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRony Ponthieux is one of them. A nurse practitioner living in Miami Gardens, he and his wife qualified for TPS after coming to the U.S. in 1999 following an unsuccessful attempt to seek asylum. He says Haitians are the engine that keeps a lot of communities, especially underprivileged minority areas, running.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are living the American dream,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have houses, jobs, are providing for our families and sending money home to help our homelands rebuild. I don\u2019t understand how we can be deported when we are doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is on for Congress to reach a deal on legislation before the July 22, 2019, cutoff. For now, the most immediate fear for the thousands of Haitian immigrants is figuring out what happens next. Ponthieux fears returning to a country so dangerous it required him to flee, and he is faced with either becoming undocumented, moving to Canada, or uprooting his young daughter and teenage son\u2014both American citizens\u2014to a country they\u2019ve never known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have never been to Haiti and don\u2019t know Haiti except for what they see on TV.

John Bel Edwards in June, in hopes of changing Louisiana\u2019s reputation as the most imprisoned state in the country.\n\n\n\nIt is the hope that the act will reduce the state\u2019s prison population by 10-12 percent and save some $262 million over the next 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Prator, it\u2019s all a waste.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the state of Louisiana is risking our safety for bragging rights and to save money,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Prator later would show his whole ass, showing that he really doesn\u2019t care about safety or bragging rights. He is concerned, it would seem, about saving money, but only in the form of cheap or free labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [prisoners] that you can work, the ones that can pick up trash, the work-release programs\u2014but guess what? Those are the ones that they\u2019re releasing!\u201d Prator fumed in a video clip tweeted out by Shaun King. \u201cIn addition to the bad ones \u2026 they\u2019re releasing some good ones that we use every day to wash cars, to change the oil in our cars, to cook in the kitchen, to do all that where we save money, well, they\u2019re going to let them out!\u201d\n\nWell, that wasn\u2019t subtle at all.

Some of those on the list did not qualify for release until 2025, mind you, with charges ranging from possession with intent to distribute marijuana and aggravated flight to DWI and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Correction Secretary James Le Blanc told the news station that he wasn\u2019t sure where Prator was getting his information and facts, and cited inaccuracies in Prator\u2019s assessment of the act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s some opening of the gates and everybody\u2019s releasing here,\u201d Le Blanc said. \u201cThis is 1,400 inmates that are going to 21 different districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have all the respect in the world for Sheriff Prator. I just don\u2019t know if he really knows what the numbers look like,\u201d he added.\n\nLe Blanc told KSLA that after the first wave of 1,400 inmates are released, releases would taper down to about 30 a month, and once again, it would only affect nonviolent and non-sex offenders who qualify.\n\nAs for the 192 inmates who Prator said were going to be released from Caddo, well, Le Blanc said that as far as he knows, the act only releases 35 come November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can put people that need to be in these beds in.

That discussion is too subjective, and no one will ever reach a consensus on any kind of art. Plus, some people have shit taste in music, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m about to argue music with anyone who believes 21 Savage is better than Nas.\n\nFor the sake of this argument, Bruno Mars is not black. He has a mixed racial background that includes Ashkenazi Jew, Puerto Rican and Filipino. One can debate where he fits in the African Diaspora, the meaning of \u201cblackness\u201d or whether race is an artificial construct. I can almost guarantee that if I called him right now and asked him to list his top five macaroni-makers, he\u2019d have to think about it for a minute, and none of the names in his top five would begin with the word \u201caunt.\u201d Black people created every form of American music. But there is a specific, indefinable genre of music that begins with R&B and encompasses hip-hop that we will heretofore refer to as \u201cblack music.\u201d\n\nThe furious debate about Bruno Mars and whether or not he is a cultural appropriator has bubbled beneath the surface of his career for a while. It existed before he remade Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk\u201d or Bell Biv DeVoe\u2019s \u201cFinesse.\u201d Even when\u2014\n\nWait ... I\u2019m being told that the previously mentioned songs are Bruno Mars originals. But I\u2019m pretty sure the S.O.S. Band made \u201c24 Karat Magic.\u201d I think it was the B side to \u201cTake Your Time,\u201d so let\u2019s use that as an example. What? That\u2019s an original song, too? OK, I\u2019m going to have to do a little more research on this and get back to you.\n\nBut before Bruno won a Grammy and Meshell Ndegeocello called him a karaoke singer, there were always people who thought that someone put Michael Jackson, Prince and James Brown into a blender with a quarter cup of lukewarm water, a dollop of mayonnaise and a smidge of racial ambiguity, and out came the next pop sensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation was reignited when this clip from the Grapevine (not this one; the other one) began circling the internet:\n\nSeren Aishitemasu, the woman in the clip makes a convincing argument breaking down why Bruno is a derivative artist who\u2014willingly or not\u2014gets to trade on his racial ambiguity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut does that necessarily mean he is guilty of cultural appropriation?\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of the term, but it generally relates to the use of the art, artifacts, symbology or anything of cultural significance to a minority or nondominant group of people by a person who is not in that group.\n\nWhat separates cultural appropriation from a cultural exchange or paying homage is when someone \u201cborrows\u201d an item or symbol of cultural significance without acknowledgment, attribution or permission. One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding the definition and the power dynamics involved in cultural appropriation is the key to understanding the concept. When Kim Kardashian put cornrows in her hair and called them \u201cBo Derek braids,\u201d it was cultural appropriation because she made no acknowledgment of the culture from which the style came.\n\nAnd yes, black people can be cultural appropriators. When a black woman wore a Native American headdress to Coachella as a costume, she was appropriating by using part of a culture\u2019s sacred ritual as cosplay. In fact, I am often accused of cultural appropriation. When people ask how I can use the white man\u2019s internet and type on a keyboard that a white man invented and not be considered an appropriator, I want to explain to them how stupid they sound, but I don\u2019t because they probably wouldn\u2019t understand the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when it comes to music and art, cultural appropriation is a tricky thing to decipher. A non-black person\u2019s involvement in a traditionally black art does not rise to the level of appropriation in and of itself. Bruno Mars is 32 years old, meaning that he grew up during a time when hip-hop and R&B ruled the charts as the most popular music in the world. Anyone making popular music in 2018 is\u2014by definition\u2014making black music, regardless of their color.\n\nTo be honest, it is incumbent on white artists to acknowledge that, even if it seems unfair.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is only doing what Janet Jackson did before her and Diana Ross did before her. But Beyonc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to bear the burden of acknowledging that every time she steps onstage because\u2014as a black woman\u2014she is an inheritor of that legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when Taylor Swift makes an album that looks like an unsweetened, gluten-free version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, it comes off as cultural appropriation, even though it is quite possible that Taylor Swift was influenced by the same artists as Queen Bey (although, judging from the fact that Swift looks like she\u2019s doing trigonometry in her head when she\u2019s doing dance choreography, I doubt it).\n\nSome might call it a double standard or reverse racism to demand that Swift and other white artists give a nod to borrowing from black music and culture while not requiring the same of black artists. However, being black means you are born into the legacy of the culture. I can walk into my grandmother\u2019s house and open the refrigerator without asking permission. You cannot.\n\nBut here is the fault line:\n\nBeing a part of a culture\u2014whether one is born into it or not\u2014also comes with the responsibility of being a caretaker of it. If we kept our mouths closed, non-blacks artists would suck our artistic heritage dry without caring what happened to whomever they left in the discarded heap. We gave Justin Timberlake a 2-decade get-out-of-appropriation-free pass. When he was finished doing his 20-years-long impression of an R&B singer, he became a \u201cMan of the Woods\u201d and distanced himself from black music like it was Janet Jackson\u2019s left titty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are black artists who have leaped to Bruno Mars\u2019 defense, saying that he is not guilty of appropriation. As someone who is only marginally aware of his music, every time I have seen him perform, give an interview or receive an award, including the Grammy, he has made sure to acknowledge that he was influenced by black music almost exclusively.\n\nSo, based on the definition of cultural appropriation, is Bruno Mars guilty?\n\nNope.\n\nEvery single word Seren said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I have a theory about the people who accuse Bruno Mars of cultural theft:\n\nMaybe they are tired of seeing people like Post Malone take bits of black culture and use them to make derivative, unoriginal content meant to be palatable for white mouths. Perhaps they are tired of seeing more-talented black artists outshone by beige newcomers who pass the paper-bag test and don\u2019t give white people the heebie-jeebies. It is possible that they are overzealous custodians of their culture.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars. Maybe they saw his act when Janelle Mon\u00e1e was doing the same thing for the past decade. Maybe they saw Bruno when he was Chris Brown. Or Bobby Brown. Or James Brown. Or MC Hammer. Or Prince. Or Michael Jackson. Or Janet Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, even if he is always careful to give props, maybe they understand that Kenny G is the best-selling jazz instrumentalist in the modern era, Eminem is the best-selling hip-hop artist of all time and there isn\u2019t a black face in the top five best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nBut they all make black music.\n\nTrust me, they know it.", "keywords": ["dont", "bruno", "controversy", "black", "artists", "doing", "white", "culture", "proves", "understand", "mars", "music", "appropriation", "cultural"], "polarity": 0.02780663780663778, "subjectivity": 0.41541666666666666},

In an interview with Billboard to promote Ventriloquism, an album of covers, the singer-songwriter and musician made clear that she wasn\u2019t impressed with Mars\u2019 performance of the \u201cFinesse\u201d remix featuring Cardi B. No, she read him with the sort of blunt, matter-of-fact assessment you\u2019d expect from a black woman at 49 (or any age, arguably, though hell hath no fury like a seasoned black queen). Per Billboard:\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of Bruno that night at the Grammys? What he\u2019s doing is karaoke, basically. With \u201cFinesse,\u201d in particular, I think he was simply copying Bell Biv DeVoe. I think he was copying Babyface. And definitely there were some elements of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis back when they worked with Human League. I feel like there\u2019s just all these threads running through there, but not in a genuine way. How fine is that balance between karaoke and artistic interpretation? It\u2019s really a matter of musicality and being able to manipulate the tropes in a way that makes it feel personal. It can\u2019t just be a pastiche, where you\u2019re copying or mimicking an old sound or just doing karaoke. There has to be a form of sincerity.\n\nI\u2019ve always appreciated Meshell Ndegeocello for sounding naturally chopped and screwed, but now I can add her ability to dismantle a target with surgical precision to the list. Ndegeocello is not the first person to call out Bruno Mars for \u201ccopying\u201d other artists. Years ago, multiple critics noted that Mars\u2019 hit \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d sounded exactly like a Police song.\n\nBack then, Bruno Mars responded to the claims with the following admission:\n\n\u201cHell yeah! You try to write a Police song!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI grew up listening to the Police, I grew up performing in bars, singing Police songs. ... I remember performing a song like \u2018Roxanne,\u2019 and you play those first couple of chords, and you hit that first note, and you watch the whole bar ignite. And as an artist, as a songwriter, it\u2019s like \u2018Man, I want to write a song that makes people\u2019s eyes explode the first chord!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when \u201cUptown Funk\u201d essentially took over all of our lives for a period in time, many astutely noted, \u201cThat motherfucker just remade \u2018Jungle Love!\u2019\u201d Others also pointed to the Gap Band\u2019s \u201cOops Upside Your Head.\u201d There is no record of Morris Day slapping Bruno Mars in retaliation, but Charlie, last name Wilson, and the rest of the Gap Band did smack Bruno and company with a suit\u2014which led to them receiving songwriting credits on the megahit.\n\n\n\nMore recently, even I couldn\u2019t help but call out the Zapp & Roger influences of \u201c24K Magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving said that, while I do think Ndegeocello is correct in pointing out the type of artists and producers who influence Bruno Mars\u2019 most recent hits, I don\u2019t question his sincerity about the kind of product he churns out just because much of it sounds so familiar to tracks of yore.\n\nAs a child, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon grew up performing at dinner theaters, and that very much informs the sort of artist and entertainer he is. That\u2019s why I was tickled when he served as wedding singer for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek\u2019s wedding to Sofia Levander in 2016 because it felt like a return to form. Bruno Mars is more or less the most successful wedding singer ever, or, at the very least, the most successful wedding singer of the modern era.\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to his music, Mars has long been up front not only in his intent when making music but also in praising those who have molded and shaped it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, in a Latina magazine interview, Mars said the following:\n\n\n\nWhen you say \u201cBlack music,\u201d understand that you are talking about rock, jazz, R&B, reggae, funk, doo-wop, hip-hop and Motown. Black people created it all. Being Puerto Rican, even salsa music stems back to the Motherland [Africa]. So, in my world, Black music means everything. It\u2019s what gives America its swag.\n\nSo he acknowledges his intentions, praises those who have helped shaped his sound and, when met with legal challenges, will pay up and move on. As far as pop stars go, that\u2019s most of what you can ask for of them. Beyond that, though, I question whether or not the kind of artist Bruno Mars is and has aimed to be calls for the kind of musicality and \u201coriginality\u201d Ndegeocello is calling him out for (while promoting a covers album, no less).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen reading her interview, it reminded me of the first time I saw Bruno Mars perform as an opening act for Janelle Mon\u00e1e (this is before the two would later tour under his banner in 2011). These two have always been similar to me in that they\u2019re amazing entertainers who have music that registers as intentionally nostalgic. Mon\u00e1e is forward-thinking in terms of her imagery and messaging, but when I\u2019m listening to her actual music, it\u2019s a lot like Bruno\u2019s in that it often makes me think of past works. That\u2019s not a jab; I\u2019m a fan of both. Not every artist is trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\nThere are certainly other critiques to be made about this. Say, why is Bruno Mars winning all of the major awards at the Grammys when the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 are robbed of their honors in these categories or Rihanna is totally snubbed altogether by being left out? Likewise, one has valid reasons to ask why Bruno Mars can be awarded for everything when the black artists who inspired him have not been as fortunate (Mariah Carey has ended the Grammys, though).\n\nStill, Bruno Mars\u2019 main goal is to entertain, and he\u2019s really good at it. So I\u2019m gonna keep bopping to the \u201cFinesse (remix).\u201d I\u2019ll continue singing to \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d as if puberty hadn\u2019t already snatched my R&B thot-throb dreams away. I will not slow down my two-stepping to \u201cChunky.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, you may one day catch me out here dancing to Bruno Mars with Anita Baker, who clearly approves of Bruno.\n\n", "keywords": ["bruno", "thats", "im", "wedding", "artist", "black", "music", "ndegeocello", "think", "right", "meshell", "bopping", "copying", "karaoke", "mars"], "polarity": 0.20269038701622968, "subjectivity": 0.43278312823256637},

After it dropped, Lena Waithe hit the tweets to ask folks what they thought about it. Those opinions ranged, but it didn\u2019t seem like anybody was ready to call for a boycott of Netflix over its release. And if you watched it, there\u2019s a very good reason for this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStep Sisters is absurd, ridiculous, cute, bad, good, kinda funny, cringeworthy-level unfunny, stereotypically stereotypical, paint-by-number, a knockoff Bring It On Pitch Perfect Stomp the Yard Don\u2019t Be a Menace, entirely unbelievable, unrealistic, heartwarming and curiously WTF. The script needs all the work and it needs all the injections of humor. But it\u2019s also kind of enjoyable at times.\n\nDo you remember Jumping the Broom, the T.D. Jakes-helmed movie about bringing together two families from opposite sides of the track for the wedding of the girl who had it all and the guy who had it rough, starring Laz Alonzo and Paula Patton? It seemed like an attempt at making a more respectable Tyler Perry movie. Except for the first time ever, I wished that Perry had been part of a project, since it would at least have been funny. Scripts matter and levity works. Throwing tropes on-screen doesn\u2019t mask bad writing and a thin premise.\n\nWelcome to Step Sisters.\n\nThe first 15 minutes of Step Sisters were possibly some of the worst 15 minutes of a movie I\u2019ve watched in a long time. Nuance? Fuck nuance. Let\u2019s just overdo shit. Jamilah (Megalyn Echikunwoke), the movie\u2019s star and member of black Greek-letter organization Theta Chi Phi, really wants to go to Harvard Law School and join her super-woke caricature white boyfriend, Dane (played by Matt McGorry), who sends ankh emojis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut her parents, both Harvard alums, refuse to write her the recommendation that is the only impediment to her acceptance. So let me get this right. A black family REFUSES to help their only child get into Harvard so that she learns how to do shit on her own, even though they know it will help her get where she\u2019s trying to go in life? And she\u2019s a good student and model sorority member and is active with her community work.\n\nThat is literally the jumping-off point. The only thing that helps here is that Jamilah\u2019s mother, played by Sheryl Lee Ralph, absolutely hates Michelle Obama, and they make it a running joke. That? Funny. Who hates Michelle Obama?\n\nOne of the white chicks in Sigma Beta Beta, a white sorority, gets caught banging a dude in a bush at a party, and their charter is up for revocation unless they get an image makeover. Enter a super-inappropriate dean of student affairs who guarantees Jamilah\u2019s entry to Harvard by providing the recommendation she so badly needs if she fixes that shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how this goes from here. The SBBs are apprehensive, but they take her up on the offer to teach them how to step to enter a charity step show and rehab their image. Except Jamilah has to hide this from her sorority sisters, who are understandably against the idea of white girls stepping. Also, oddly, the head of the SBBs has a brother who is black who ends up wooing Jamilah with zombies and the Cars. Yes, the rock group. They go from zero to 100, nigga, real quick.\n\nThe SBBs, of course, fuck up their first foray into stepping, kind of like how the Barden Bellas fucked up their first attempt at a show in Pitch Perfect. But they decide to give it another go and finally start to understand sisterhood. Which is when Jamilah\u2019s life goes to shit. She loses her job, her sorority sisters, her mother and Harvard and decides to leave school to finish her degree through a correspondence course. It\u2019s like Randolph and Mortimer Duke from Trading Places decided to ruin her life. For a dollar.\n\nThe white girls (and one SBB black girl) get it together eventually, step in a regional comp and get jobbed by the judges even though they placed but didn\u2019t win, and Jamilah\u2019s soror and SBB\u2019s biggest critic, played by Naturi Naughton, comes to their defense to make sure they get their just due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we all smile and shit. One friend of mine even said she shed tears. Truth is, the script isn\u2019t terrible. It\u2019s not good, either. The execution is nowhere NEAR as good as it could be. The script needed more humor and we had to suspend too much reality. How is it possible that this super-popular black head of her sorority is able to attend SBB events and help these white chicks learn to step, and her entire sorority has no idea EVEN though she enlists the help of other black fraternity members? Nobody talks??? And again, the whole \u201cMy parents who love me and realize how awesome I am decided they want me to earn my stripes the old-fashioned way\u201d premise makes no sense.\n\nMegalyn is good in her role. And the white chicks (and the black one) are interesting as her test cases. They are likable. And Lyndon Smith as Danielle, the leader of the SBBs, plays a good foil for Jamilah. Yes, this is a movie about white women appropriating stepping culture and getting some credit for being white doing black stuff, but it doesn\u2019t feel too white. Admittedly, the second time I watched\u2014that\u2019s how much I love you people; I\u2019ve watched it more than once\u2014I found myself liking it more than I did the first time. To be fair, I also liked Tupac\u2019s song \u201cJust Like Daddy\u201d after repeated listenings, too, so there\u2019s that.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for this movie to be anything more than a tale of white girls falling over themselves trying to compete at a black art\u2014and why would you be?\u2014you\u2019ll actually be disappointed. It isn\u2019t deep or going to truly illustrate anything about campus race relations among Greeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s a decent movie about relationships in general and overcoming adversity and not giving up. And the SBBs do a good job in the final step show, as opposed to the PURE ASS they are in the first step show, where they tried to prove to everybody else that they could do it. If you\u2019re looking for a ridiculous movie where white chicks fall all over themselves but then come together and the black lead character is awesome and does a good job with the material she\u2019s given, this is your jammy jam.\n\nCan I recommend it? Eh. If you have nothing better to do with your time and are tired of watching any of the Fast and Furious movies that seem to run ad nauseam, then it\u2019s a good respite. It\u2019s not the worst movie you\u2019ll ever see at all. I assure you that you\u2019ve seen worse movies. And it is enjoyable in parts. And most important, it does get better, even though I did want to throw my iPad out of the window because of the final competition. But I also expected them to lame out and have the white girls win, and since they didn\u2019t, I have to give some credit.\n\nSo if you like movies with black people and your Netflix queue tells you that You Got Served is popular on Netflix? Step Sisters is your lane.

Kennedy was an explosive FBI report about civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King Jr. Even though the report had nothing to do with the JFK assassination, the Trump administration included the newly unsealed dossier in a trove of documents released Friday related to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas.\n\nWhat is the document?\n\nCommissioned by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the 20-page report is titled \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.: A Current Analysis\u201d (pdf). It is dated March 12, 1968\u2014curiously, less than a month before King was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is in the report?\n\nLies.\n\nThe report is rife with falsehoods, speculation and disproven allegations about King, including his ties to communism and stories about secret orgies with prostitutes and white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did they think King was a communist?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nYou know how today\u2019s incarnation of suspicious, fragile white-power brokers now label every anti-establishment organization a \u201cterrorist group\u201d? Well, in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \u201ccommunism\u201d shrank the collective Caucasian anus and furrowed white brows with fear, so every group of people who dared to speak truth to power was saddled with the label \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, the report ties King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Communist Party USA, a small, marginalized group with no influence by 1960. The details of the document allege that King and the SCLC were heavily influenced by Stanley Levinson, a lawyer and businessman who financed the party for years.\n\nThe dossier tries to tie King to the Communist Party through Levinson even though Levinson had left the party years before he met King. It insists that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was related to a secret communist agenda without offering any solid evidence.\n\nWas King a communist?\n\nDidn\u2019t I just say the report was filled with lies? Are you even paying attention?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of explaining it to you, I\u2019ll just tell you what King told his trusted adviser Bayard Rustin in 1965 as King was crafting a statement announcing the unity of the civil rights organizations:\n\nThere are things I wanted to say renouncing communism in theory, but they would not go along with it. We wanted to say that it was an alien philosophy contrary to us, but they wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\n\nPart of the FBI\u2019s allegations of communism is fueled by King\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, which some translated as support for the commuinist Viet Cong. Some of it is tied to the fact that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was seen by some melanin-impaired capitalists as un-American. King\u2019s strategy of peaceful resistance is also closely affiliated with Karl Marx\u2019s belief in the possibility of achieving equality through peaceful revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that there were communists affiliated with the civil rights movement. Some of them were prominent supporters, but that does not mean that King or the entire movement for equality was a communist plot.\n\nSome of the people reading this article hold unspeakably heinous beliefs, like putting sugar on grits. This publication even employs people who commit un-American acts like giving trick-or-treaters candy corn for Halloween or putting ketchup in the refrigerator. Corey Townsend, The Root\u2019s social media editor, even confessed that he likes pumpkin-spice-related foods.\n\nBut none of these terrible acts means that everyone here at The Root is an evil, demented terrorist of taste buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about the sex orgies?\n\nJust say \u201corgies\u201d; the \u201csex\u201d part is understood. There aren\u2019t any other kinds of orgies, although I have joined friends at a certain Atlanta restaurant for what can only be described as a \u201clemon-pepper-wing orgy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis from the FBI, King\u2019s associates held a workshop in 1968 in Miami to train a minister. The report states that some in attendance were disgusted with the whiskey drinking, homosexuality and fornication at the conference, including a sex show with prostitutes who engaged in activities \u201cdeviating from the normal sex acts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report does not say that King was present at this event but details affairs by King, including one with singer Joan Baez and an alleged love child with the wife of a prominent Los Angeles dentist. The single source for this information is a \u201cresponsible\u201d informant \u201cin a position to know.\u201d\n\nWhy does any of this matter?\n\nAgain, because ... white people.\n\nNone of this salacious detail negates the fact that King was fighting for the freedom or equality of black people. It does not dismiss the reality of Jim Crow, segregation, voter suppression, unequal housing, inferior education, state-sponsored terrorism or the unconstitutional, government-backed treatment of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reasonable explanation for any of this is that it was an attempt to discredit MLK and, by proxy, the entire civil rights movement.\n\nHow did they use this information?\n\nHoover and the FBI used it in a number of ways. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, tried to destroy the civil rights movement for years by casting it as a subversive, communist-backed agenda. The details in this report were ammunition for much of that FBI agenda. In November 1964, the FBI sent a letter to King telling him that it was aware of his extramarital affairs. The bureau threatened to release this information if King didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank God J. Edgar Hoover is gone. Today\u2019s FBI would never do this again, right?\n\nCould you do me a favor and hold my lemon-pepper wing while I double over in laughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general who controls the FBI, is known for calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d A few months after he took office, an FBI report leaked that characterized the threat from \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d as the new terrorist threat. Even the nonviolent group Black Lives Matter is often called a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d by members on the conservative side of the aisle.\n\nIf you believe that the day has passed when anyone concerned with justice or equality could be painted by right-wing zealots as evil, anti-American villains, just remember to turn on your television around 1 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon and watch the Caucasian crowd members boo NFL players for kneeling quietly during the national anthem, or read one of the many right-wing rags\u2019 desperate attempts to tie former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI dossier proves that Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a coordinated, government-funded effort to suppress the civil rights movement. President Donald Trump\u2019s release of the documents provides additional fuel for those who seek to denigrate anything black and outspoken because their history of complicity gives them the heebie-jeebies. Because they are too willing to believe that a civil rights legend was a communist and sexual deviant, but not that their dear, pumpkin-colored, pussy-grabbing president is a sexual assaulter. Because that would mean that they were on the wrong side of history for more than a quadruple century.\n\n\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["jr", "say", "communist", "martin", "wanted", "know", "king", "kings", "file", "white", "black", "liefilled", "rights", "luther", "trump", "fbi", "report", "civil", "released"], "polarity": -0.02562157287157288, "subjectivity": 0.4564069264069264},

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand? So we start with a little bit of Instagram and now we have 5,000 followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat following is now over 25,000\u2014and rising since Sunday night. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

When I checked it out yesterday, it was sitting at roughly 25 million views on YouTube, and as of today, it\u2019s nearing 30 million. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drake \u201cgot one.\u201d The song is dope on its own, but the video levels shit all the way up.\n\nThe premise is this: The video has a budget of almost a million dollars, so Drake decides to do something meaningful with that budget and gives all of it away to folks in and around Miami. He\u2019s giving out money to folks on the street, at grocery stores, in college. He\u2019s out here buying cars (and hopefully insurance and gas money\u2014them joints weren\u2019t Passats), sending people on shopping sprees and handing literal stacks of cash to folks.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this video. You can choose to look at it as Drake shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings of anybody watching by using his video to paint himself as a sort of hood superman. Much of the video where he\u2019s not giving away money looks to be shot in various hoods of Miami. For those folks he\u2019s handing money to, maybe he\u2019s just temporarily providing a salve when what they might need is actual help (housing, education, etc.) to get and stay out of whatever their situation is.\n\nTemporary help is just that; it\u2019s not changing lives for real. That\u2019s a more cynical view of the video\u2014that Drake is basically pimping fans he\u2019s likely never going to see again for page views and clicks. Shit, he (presumably) didn\u2019t even give away his own money (though somebody still had to pay for that video, which is not shot on anybody\u2019s iPhone).\n\nOn the other hand\u2014this is where I stand\u2014Drake is doing a good deed. A lot of them, actually. And you never know who needs a good deed in their life. Or who is $20 away from being on the street. Or for whom a simple $100 can change everything, or at the very least their week. Money, for the VAST majority of Americans, is a constant struggle. Help is help, however it comes, whenever it comes. I love to see good things happen to people. I love it.\n\nWhen Oprah gives away shit, I love it and I feel happy for the recipients. When Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired, I cried with those folks who got new homes and new leases on life because sometimes, just sometimes, you need some good fortune. Or Undercover Boss, where employees who show up every day and anonymously do their job to the best of their ability are finally seen by the very people signing their checks. When one of those employees gets rewarded, it makes me emotional. I really like to see good things happen to people, especially folks who don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember being surprised when Prince died by how much he did for people. There were stories all over the place, especially in Minneapolis, of folks who had been beneficiaries of Prince\u2019s big heart. Shit, you\u2019d think Prince literally helped out every single person he came into contact with. When Prince died, people happily came out of the woodwork to talk about how generous and thoughtful he was and how he\u2019d do whatever he could to help. And he did it all anonymously. That\u2019s how I like to live my own life. I help people out when I can and it\u2019s because I realize that when you have, it\u2019s a duty to help out those in need to the best of your ability.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about Drake\u2019s video. I honestly don\u2019t care about whose money he gave away or how he got it. I\u2019m just glad he was helping folks who clearly needed it. When he handed those stacks to that young man and his (I assume) mother, and they both broke down crying, I felt like Drake knew that while he was handing out money, he gave them something more valuable. I don\u2019t know how anybody ended up being chosen to receive money, but you could tell after they received something, their days were a little bit better. I was moved to tears several times during the video. And I honestly don\u2019t care if I got pimped for my tears, because that wasn\u2019t fake money he was giving out, and those folks whose lives he touched appreciated it.\n\nWhen people with lots of money and resources realize that they can change folks\u2019 lives with simple gestures (and for rich people, money can be a simple gesture), I gain an appreciation for them because it shows me that they get it. I watched Drake\u2019s video and I felt like Drake \u201cgets it.\u201d He went where he saw a need and alleviated some of it.

The Trump administration decided Friday that, effective immediately, any employer can claim a religious or moral objection to providing birth control coverage under its insurance plan.\n\nThe Obamacare mandate that requires birth control to be provided at no cost has been opposed by religious groups and fought in court for more than five years, as Politico notes.\n\nThe administration has published a 100-page document (pdf) in which it writes:\n\nThe United States has a long history of providing conscience protections in the regulation of health care for entities and individuals with objections based on religious beliefs or moral convictions. These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect moral convictions for certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive coverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document notes that the new Trump mandate will not affect other federal programs that \u201cprovide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk of unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe administration claims to be protecting people from being forced to violate their religious beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring and downplaying the fact that this will now make it harder for many women to get access to birth control.\n\nPolitico reports that women\u2019s groups are already moving to counter this change with lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told Politico:\n\nToday\u2019s outrageous rules by the Trump Administration show callous disregard for women\u2019s rights, health, and autonomy. By taking away women\u2019s access to no-cost birth control coverage, the rules give employers a license to discriminate against women. We will take immediate legal steps to block these unfair and discriminatory rules.\n\nIn 2014 the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores that private companies could seek an exemption from providing birth control coverage on religious grounds. Politico found last year that in the time since that ruling, only 52 companies or nonprofits sought to opt out of the birth control requirement based on religion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, women saved $1.4 billion on birth control pills in 2013 because of the mandate, and about 55 million women have benefited directly from no-cost birth control.\n\nThis latest move by the Trump administration will undoubtedly have a ripple effect that affects not just women but America as a whole.\n\nAs the director of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Haywood Brown, told Politico, \u201cAny move to decrease access to these vital services would have damaging effects on public health and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remove access to birth control while simultaneously making cuts to social welfare programs, how do all these children born unintentionally get taken care of?\n\nWhat is the endgame here?\n\nRead more at Politico and read the Trump document here (pdf).", "keywords": ["politico", "administration", "womens", "mandate", "cover", "religious", "control", "health", "obamacare", "trump", "removes", "birth", "women"], "polarity": 0.042842111592111584, "subjectivity": 0.4002585377585377},

You probably recognize that combination of words and syllables from Black Moon\u2019s 1993 song \u201cWho Got da Props?\u201d off of their Enta da Stage album. But they asked a very important question, and the answer to that question is undoubtedly Belcalis Almanzar, better known to the world as Cardi B.\n\nI\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to think of who could possibly have had a better 2017 than she. Hell, her 2018 is even going well. She managed to get on the stage at the Grammys and perform with Bruno Mars\u2014the night\u2019s big winner\u2014and then end up in a freakin\u2019 Super Bowl commercial for Amazon.com\u2019s Alexa.\n\nLove her or hate her\u2014and I honestly don\u2019t know how you can hate her\u2014her glow up is real, happening on her own terms, and ultimately, she seems to be truly enjoying it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider this: She\u2019s managed to be the first woman\u2014not Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki Minaj, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys\u2014to have five songs simultaneously featured in the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. She had the indisputable song of 2017 in \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d reaching No. 1 on the pop charts. While Nicki had a much better verse on Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorSport,\u201d half of the times I\u2019ve heard the song, the DJ cut it off after Cardi\u2019s verse. That makes NO sense, but also, I get it. This is the world we live in. Cardi B hopped on Bruno Mars\u2019 song \u201cFinesse\u201d and with the awesome video became even more endearing. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible.\n\nConsidering where most of us first saw her, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s a word to describe her ascent. Like most folks, I first saw her on Love & Hip Hop through DJ Self as he was trying to work with her and not work with her at the same time. She was the hotheaded Dominican from the South Bronx, N.Y., with \u201cthe teeth\u201d\u2014she got a bag and fixed those\u2014who was dating the dude in prison. She couldn\u2019t quite get anybody to check out her music in a real way.\n\nNow? She lives on the charts, performs at the Grammys, is engaged to a Migo(s), is in Super Bowl commercials and gives hilarious interviews on red carpets. Of her appearance at the Grammys, she managed to say that she had butterflies in both her stomach and her vagina, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the new standard now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the hesitation on the part of hip-hoppers to heap too much praise on her. She is, after all, a rapper. And I\u2019m not sure anybody would be rushing to crown her the queen of rap, especially when Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma are out there. They\u2019re rappers. Cardi B is more of a personality who decided to do like so many others: use music as her vehicle to doing something other than starving. They\u2019re not really in it for the craft; they\u2019re in it for the money.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a hip-hop head who will fight anybody over the \u201990s, I get the difficulty in being happy about this. BUT I\u2019m also a person who believes that anybody with limitations who maximizes on their opportunities and doesn\u2019t burn down the industry along the way isn\u2019t ruining the culture. She\u2019s not Vanilla Ice or Snow. Or Bo$$, who famously faked her entire life and upbringing to become a gangsta rapper. She\u2019s the real MC Gusto from CB4.\n\nCardi has both put herself and been put in positions where she could make the most of them or fumble, and thus far, she\u2019s kicked asses and taken names. By being what I can only presume is authentically her and releasing music that absolutely beats, she\u2019s gained fans and people who aren\u2019t fans but are running out of reasons to hate her. She\u2019s winning; why hate on somebody who is winning with a smile by being her best self, flaws and all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Facebook, I saw a friend of mine point out that Cardi B should probably have been considered for best new artist at the Grammys. And that\u2019s absolutely true. The way the Grammys are set up, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll be up for that award in 2022. But no other artist in the past six months has gone from \u201cWe think we heard of her\u201d to being a damn-near household name like she has. People genuinely like her, and you can\u2019t force personal gravity.\n\nEarly on, I was on the struggle-to-find-the-reason-we-should-care-about-Cardi bandwagon, but somewhere along the way, I had to acknowledge that I kept saying I didn\u2019t like her but knew all the words to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and enjoyed her random, sometimes entirely nonsensical Instagram musings and even follow her on IG, and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt when she got problematic.\n\nAt some point, you just have to give people their credit for doing things their way and managing to be super successful at them. That is Cardi. Do I think she\u2019ll be around for the next 10 years as an artist of note? I honestly have no idea. Maybe there\u2019s an artist in there trying to get out that will surprise us all. Or maybe not. Maybe we\u2019ve seen what she has to offer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll keep getting until we all collectively don\u2019t want it anymore. Whatever the output, Cardi B got now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for that come up?

I remember when Drumline: A New Beat (effectively Drumline 2) came out on VH1 (and was terrible), black folks had a field day tearing it to shreds. But this shit right here? This shit right here, my nigga? I almost feel like I need to stretch, smoke a cigarette and drink some yak with Shannon Sharpe before I open up Twitter when this movie releases, and I only do one of the three aforementioned things ever (spoiler alert: It\u2019s drink yak minus Shannon Sharpe).\n\nLet\u2019s break down the premise, based on the just-released trailer (above): White chicks need saving. Black woman gets extorted, ends up saving white chicks with art. It\u2019s like reverse Freedom Writers, minus the extortion plotline. That\u2019s the short version. Here\u2019s the long version (from IMDb):\n\n\n\nJamilah has her whole life figured out. She\u2019s the president of her black sorority, captain of their champion step dance crew, is student liaison to the college dean, and her next move is on to Harvard Law School. She\u2019s got it all, right? But when the hard-partying white girls from Sigma Beta Beta embarrass the school, Jamilah is ordered to come to the rescue. Her mission is to not only teach the rhythmically-challenged girls how to step dance, but to win the Steptacular, the most competitive of dance competitions. With the SBB\u2019s reputations and charter on the line, and Jamilah\u2019s dream of attending Harvard in jeopardy, these outcast screw-ups and their unlikely teacher stumble through one hilarious misstep after another. Cultures clash, romance blossoms, and sisterhood prevails as everyone steps out of their comfort zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much the prequel to this Washington Post story about the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga.\n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m going to watch this. Some may decide it\u2019s not their ministry. I\u2019m not one of them; I\u2019m going to church. I watch enough terribly produced movies to grant myself some grace here and watch a well-produced potential train wreck. So if you refuse to watch, that\u2019s cool, I got you. With that being said and based on the trailer alone, here are 10 reasons I plan to watch Step Sisters on Jan. 19:\n\n1. Because it exists.\n\nIf you have a bad movie featuring black people, I will watch it. I\u2019m not even embarrassed by my Netflix \u201cPopular on Netflix\u201d list or Amazon Prime-recommended movies anymore. I only wish they\u2019d suggest shit that had better production value. Point is, if it exists and there are black people, there\u2019s a better than 99 percent chance that I will press play. It turns out that there\u2019s a thin line between supporting black folks and masochism at times, and the black cinematic arts sometimes prove this to be true, but that has yet to slow my black-movie roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. It looks like a mix between Stomp the Yard, Pitch Perfect, Bring It On and Save the Last Dance.\n\nI love Pitch Perfect. I love Stomp the Yard. I went to the actual movie theater to see Bring It On in Atlanta as an HBCU college student and enjoyed it tremendously. Save the Last Dance is not without its charm, though it\u2019s pretty much a Magical Negro(es) movie as a bunch of streetwise black kids help influence a white woman\u2019s dancing, getting her into Juilliard. Bagger Vance would be so proud. Point is, I like enough of those movies to watch a Girl Talk-style movie version of them all, even knowing the product is problematic.\n\n3. I like to know what I\u2019m mad at and make sure I\u2019m mad about the right shit.\n\nWe know that this movie is going to be all types of problematic. I don\u2019t care how many black people are associated with the making of this movie; creating art that \u2019pacifically encourages and shows how cultural appropriation is borne and how we give away our art is some malarkey. So I need to watch it JUST to make sure I\u2019m mad about all of the appropriate things. Though I seriously doubt that white America is going to watch this in droves, so stepping might be mostly safe. Might be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It looks like there will be high comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie that focuses on white people trying to rhythmically move with and without music. I don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s funny.\n\n5. It also looks wildly entertaining.\n\nI get it! Appropriation. I know. Purge me, my sweet brotha Numpsy. And yet, the trailer is intriguing. Again, Pitch Perfect meets Save the Last Dance. Pitch Perfect is one of the best unintentionally awesome movies ever. I\u2019m not missing another one of those.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. For the culture.\n\nSomebody has to take the L, since I imagine lots of people will boycott (maybe \u201cboycott\u201d is too strong a word; perhaps \u201cignore with purpose\u201d?). Of course, lots of people are \u201cboycotting\u201d the NFL, too, except in Philadelphia, where I imagine \u201cunless the Eagles have a good season\u201d is in the fine print on the \u201cBoycott the NFL\u201d memo circulating around African America.\n\n7. The setting is the Atlanta University Center\u2019s Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University.\n\nI saw Graves Hall (Morehouse\u2019s most important building) in the trailer and smiled much like I do with any movie that features Morehouse\u2019s campus, like Hidden Figures, Stomp the Yard, Drumline, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. I\u2019ve rather enjoyed every single thing Naturi Naughton has been a part of ... that I\u2019ve seen.\n\n3LW (OK, that\u2019s a reach), Notorious, Power. Even Lottery Ticket. Maybe I\u2019ll enjoy her in this, too.\n\n9. The black leads all seem to be too old to play college students, and yet here we are. The white people all had to be ... younger.\n\nI typically enjoy watching living proof that black don\u2019t crack. It\u2019s a form of #BlackExcellence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I have a running list of Magical Negroes, and I like to stay current.\n\nBagger Vance. John Coffey. Morgan Freeman. Olivia Pope. Morpheus. Anthony Mackie\u2019s character in The Adjustment Bureau. Neil deGrasse Tyson. Barack Obama. All the black kids in Save the Last Dance. The movie version of Michael Oher in The Blindside, which doubles also as the greatest white-savior movie of all time\u2014a Magical Negro-white-savior-Remember the Titans-esque trifecta of feel-good shit. Cam Newton, because his haberdashery is the stuff of Magical Negro legend. As you can see, the list grows, and the characters of Step Sisters look primed to be in that number.", "keywords": ["version", "im", "trailer", "netflixs", "going", "likely", "black", "white", "sisters", "movie", "dance", "step", "reasons", "watch"], "polarity": 0.1534192681753657, "subjectivity": 0.5310435364093901},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["dont", "chakras", "peele", "shahidi", "noah", "harlems", "supersoul", "shes", "fears", "brought", "apollo", "miranda", "aligned", "oprah", "conversations"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

The FBI report was released on Aug. 3\u2014just nine days before a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign Policy obtained the report, which is marked for official use only. The document warns that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d pose a growing threat to law enforcement. In a particularly cruel and unfounded assertion, the FBI claims that police attacks on black Americans could spur \u201cpremeditated, retaliatory lethal violence\u201d against the police.\n\nFrom Foreign Policy:\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \u201calleged\u201d police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight. Because the response to Michael Brown\u2019s death was the first instance of black people voicing outrage about police brutality.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically call out Black Lives Matter, the group certainly is the subtext of the document. As Foreign Policy rightly notes, 168 black Americans have been shot and killed by the police in 2017 alone. Law enforcement has killed 748 people in all this year so far.\n\nThat\u2019s 748 lives in less than 10 months, nearly a quarter of them black.\n\nMeanwhile, the report lists six total acts of premeditated violence against officers, including the shooting death of Dallas police officers at a BLM rally in July 2016. The shooter, Micah Johnson, wasn\u2019t affiliated with BLM but was reportedly \u201cinfluenced by BIE ideology,\u201d based on his journals and statements to police, according to the FBI report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is the latest iteration of a long tradition of the FBI targeting and tracking black activists. The most famous example is COINTELPRO, which was created in 1956 with the explicit intent to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist[s],\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s own documents. Then, as now, the people the feds are actually targeting were mostly activists fighting to advance racial equality.\n\n\n\nOr, at the very least, stop the government from ceaselessly, and with impunity, killing black people and people of color.\n\nEarlier this year, The Intercept reported that the FBI began investigating white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement in 2015. That classified document was crafted, notably, under the Obama administration, and warned of white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in \u201cinfiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did release a report earlier this year that warned that the white supremacist movement \u201clikely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\u201d However, the new guidance on \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d draws a dangerous equivocation between a movement that is seeing a visible resurgence and one that seems completely conjured by the FBI.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, this new guidance has raised eyebrows among the intelligence community, with one former official expressing shock at the report\u2019s contents.\n\n\u201cThis is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\u201d the former official told FP. \u201cThere are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Foreign Policy.", "keywords": ["identity", "violence", "20", "extremists", "black", "law", "targeting", "launches", "white", "movement", "enforcement", "fbi", "cointelpro", "foreign", "report", "policy"], "polarity": -0.032507111935683376, "subjectivity": 0.4133005565862708},

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["african", "style", "argument", "ankara", "know", "rock", "kwanzaa", "black", "love", "ankhs", "fashion", "ongoing", "wearing", "stella", "right", "appropriationvsappreciation", "way", "trend"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

A new report from BuzzFeed News confirms that the Department of Justice is investigating Harvard University\u2019s admissions practices. The investigation likely centers on allegations that Harvard\u2019s use of affirmative action discriminates against students of Asian descent, according to the report.\n\nBuzzFeed reports that the confirmation is based on Freedom of Information Act requests sent to the DOJ \u201cseeking records about investigations into admissions practices\u201d at two universities: Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While the Justice Department maintained that there were no relevant records related to UNC, the department told BuzzFeed that it could not disclose any Harvard documents because they were being \u201ccompiled for law-enforcement purposes,\u201d making them exempt from the FOIA request.\n\nWhen contacted about the response letter, the DOJ confirmed that there is an \u201cactive\u201d investigation at Harvard.\n\nThe confirmation signals that the Trump administration will forge ahead in its plans to dismantle affirmative action by claiming it hurts another minority group: Asian Americans. The news comes nearly two months after an internal Justice Department document was released indicating that resources in its Civil Rights Division would be redirected toward investigating and suing universities over their affirmative action policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harvard investigation centers on a single complaint filed by 64 Asian-American groups in 2014 that claimed the prestigious Ivy League university discriminated against Asian-American applicants. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students static year after year.\n\nBut at the center of the suit is a man who has had his eyes set on dismantling key civil-rights-era legislation: Edward Blum. The conservative attorney successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, with the Supreme Court effectively gutting the landmark legislation in 2013. Blum also challenged the University of Texas\u2019 race-based admissions policies as being discriminatory against white students. The Supreme Court last year ruled against Blum and upheld the use of race in admissions decisions.\n\nNow Blum hopes to use Asian Americans as a wedge to dismantle policies that have broadly benefited people of color. In fact, data shows that the Asian-American community may actually support affirmative action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice, a civil rights group, polled Asian-American voters last year and found that 64 percent supported affirmative action programs \u201cdesigned to help blacks, women and other minorities get better access to higher education,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nNicole Gon Ochi, an attorney for the group, pointed out to the Los Angeles Times that Asian Americans are not a monolith, and that affirmative action programs have been particularly helpful for \u201ctraditionally disadvantaged\u201d populations, like Southeast Asian and low-income Asian students.\n\nAnd a HuffPost article published earlier this year points out that data consistently shows that white students are frequently held to lower standards than their Asian-American peers in the college admissions process. Instead of focusing on this disparity, however, groups like those that launched the 2014 Harvard complaint have blamed black and Latinx applicants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Kim Forde-Mazrui, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes on race, told the Los Angeles Times in August, the Trump administration\u2019s feigned interest in protecting Asian Americans is politically opportunistic.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily about conservative leaders protecting the privilege of access to society\u2019s resources and opportunities for certain white constituents,\u201d Forde-Mazrui said, noting that white conservatives don\u2019t care about anti-Asian discrimination in other spaces.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see many of them concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans in other contexts, such as the \u2018bamboo ceiling\u2019 in corporate America, where such discrimination does not harm white interests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["hit", "department", "justice", "americans", "harvard", "asian", "asianamerican", "white", "students", "affirmative", "university", "admissions", "action", "report", "probe"], "polarity": 0.1296027976998126, "subjectivity": 0.3660859662725334},

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

Gone were his witty lyrics and catchy, soulful beats. Instead, he used the medium of Auto-Tune to express his pain while using the androidlike sound to hide emotions a black man, much less a rapper, was not allowed to feel.

MBDTF, even with its flaws, is a masterpiece and the strongest argument for why Kanye is one of the most important artists in the last 25 years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012\n\nWon: Mumford & Sons\u2019 Babel\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange\n\n\n\nI like an album full of philosophical folk songs as much as the next guy, but Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange was monumental.

It was not the first \u201csurprise album,\u201d but it was the one that set industry standards about how to release in the streaming era. Why this lost to Beck is beyond me.

His sound was both rustic and virtuosic, while the lyrics were urgent without being inaccessible.

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["book", "thats", "matter", "heart", "jones", "tayari", "love", "know", "american", "marriage", "didnt", "novel", "gets", "man"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

One of Nielsen\u2019s first priorities is putting Manigault in her place.\n\nAccording to sources inside the cross-burning dumpster fire called \u201cthe Trump administration,\u201d Manigault had a habit of showing up unannounced at important meetings, sitting down and making herself comfortable.

This, despite the fact that the Versace family has issued a press release calling the series\u2014based on Vanity Fair correspondent Maureen Orth\u2019s book Vulgar Favors\u2014\u201ca work of fiction.\u201d\n\nDonatella Versace, sister of Gianni and heir to the brand, has flatly stated that she \u201cwill not be watching.\u201d And truly, I can\u2019t imagine\u2014even with the genius casting of Darren Criss from Glee as Versace\u2019s deranged murderer, Andrew Cunanan; singer Ricky Martin as Gianni\u2019s partner; Oscar winner Penelope Cruz playing Donatella; and Edgar Ramirez as Gianni himself\u2014that the series could possibly capture the brilliant life and work of the late designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make movies about real magic. That\u2019s exactly what taking part in Versace\u2019s family business was like. With knees trembling, I stepped onto Versace\u2019s Milan runway for the first time in the early \u201990s. At the time, I had never before seen clothes up close and personal that screamed sex, drugs, rock and roll, money and L-I-F-E so articulately.\n\nWhat I loved most about Versace was that he made being ordinary impossible. Every millimeter of his clothes was drenched in color and patterns playfully layered on top of more patterns, then fastened with gold Medusa medallions or gilded bondage buckles shackling plunging necklines, and skirts slit thigh-high onto bodies more than willing to carry his message forth into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat message was: If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u2014and then flaunt it some more.\n\nWorking with Versace was a trip through the looking glass, where the boundaries of what it meant to be new money or old money, a slut or a lady, were totally killed, crushed and destroyed. It was like walking the halls of Versailles, or standing at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza, or looking up at the Chrysler Building\u2014all of which are on a such a scale, you can only be overwhelmed, in the best way, and forced to dream of what\u2019s possible.\n\nVersace\u2019s dresses transformed women into beacons of light, painted in celebratory, blazing columns of color. When I wear head-to-toe Versace, the mixture of inspiration and envy coming at me from onlookers feels electric. This is how I felt that Versace\u2014who was, incidentally, a very quiet man\u2014moved through the world, courting both inspiration and envy because he was so unapologetically himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always thought that Versace was a very, very shy person deep down,\u201d says my great friend Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, former creative director of American Vogue, who was also a confidant and collaborator of Versace\u2019s\u2014and my entree into the House of Versace as a model.\n\nVersace made my knees tremble for many reasons back in the early \u201990s. When I first saw his clothes, I was overwhelmed, even intimidated, by the fabulousness. Coming to understand that his little sister, Donatella, was his muse and his heart, and that his clothes were his way of giving his heart to her, gave me the courage to make those epic struts down the runway.\n\nAnd it was a runway like no other before or since; hand-laid with Italian marble brought in specially to every venue for the show, illuminated by the most skillful lighting crews in the business. Each model had her own spotlight trained on her every step.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Gianni] instinctively had a sense of the personality of models, casting his shows with fierce editing, and fierce rehearsals the night before a presentation,\u201d Talley says.\n\nAnd truly, it was always a cliffhanger to see what clothes and which models would make the final cut after rehearsals that could last into the wee hours of the morning\u2014sometimes as long as six hours the night before a show. And yet, whether you made it or you didn\u2019t\u2014one season, I was cut because my hips were one-quarter inch too large for a sheath dress\u2014you still had a sense that you were always welcome into the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPaterfamilias\u201d was a perfect description of Gianni Versace. \u201cIn many ways, he created a fashion family through his favorite band of supermodels; not only on his runway but in huge Avedon campaigns that were an extension of his life through fashion. He lived and slept fashion,\u201d says Talley of his friend.\n\nThose who knew him knew his siblings\u2014his brother, Santos, co-chief operating officer of Versace holdings, and sister, Donatella, creative director of the company\u2014as well as their children, who were his lifeblood as much as fashion.\n\n\u201cAfter his collections, he loved nothing more than taking the flight from Milan to Miami, where, sadly, he ended his life,\u201d Talley recalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I remember most about Versace was that he gave us permission to be rock-star spectacular in everyday life. He threw down the velvet gauntlet, daring you to make the ordinary extraordinary. May he always be remembered for carrying the torch for creating the most spectacular and authentic image of ourselves. That\u2019s real magic.\n\nYou can judge for yourself if Ryan Murphy gets it right with Versace\u2019s story when it premieres Wednesday night on FX. But just to prove that #VersaceMagic is still very much alive, I want to leave you with a quick hit of it via Bruno Mars and Zendaya.\n\nBruno Mars via YouTube", "keywords": ["runway", "money", "clothes", "sister", "reign", "talley", "gianni", "night", "versace", "versaces", "long", "house", "life"], "polarity": 0.2193313800021117, "subjectivity": 0.5629909724421918},

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president.

She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man.

I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence.

There are 938,488,847,474,202 white people who have ever lived (I counted). I\u2019m sure at least three or four of them made somewhat decent music.

But it also proves that you selectively chose who you wanted to be. Why didn\u2019t you dress up as Prince Markie Dee from the Fat Boys, then?

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W.

Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep.

The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life.

Well, Mona Scott-Young if Mona Scott-Young were a 71-year-old white man with the intellectual curiosity of Cujo (after Cujo was shot dead), and the emotional intelligence of a raging teenager who just gulped the last bottle of Four Loko in North America. Yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nThe longer this disaster of an administration goes on, the more it feels as if anyone who chooses to work at the White House faces risks more akin to a rookie reality-television personality than to any political appointee. Usually, a political staffer may be ousted, but at the very least, they can keep their dignity, marriages and spines intact as they go pimp the speaker and TV-pundit circuit. Not so much with Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, no. You enter this bitch, and chances are you will leave with irreparable damage to your reputation. Of course, it\u2019s unsurprising that a reality-TV-star candidate for president runs his White House as if it were a reality show. And considering that 45 cares only about Twitter, various strains of prejudice, golf and yelling at cable news, I imagine that the man would much rather pit his staff against one another and let chaos ensue than read his daily briefs.\n\n\n\nBut at least reality stars walk away from national embarrassment with a new stream of income by way of a mixtape, liquor line, Instagram boutique or invitation to join the cast of the new season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp. What are newly departed fools of Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration leaving with? I almost feel bad for the newly fired fools, who signed up to serve a disloyal, lazy thot who ultimately plays the shit out of each of them. I say \u201calmost\u201d\n\nbecause when you sign up to work for white supremacy\u2019s equivalent of the D-League, this is what your ass gets.\n\n\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nTo that end, let us begin with Anthony Scaramucci, who somehow managed the feat of being fired before he officially started his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal as communications director especially hilarious is that he was just talking cash-money shit to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u201d The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c \u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["real", "housewives", "priebus", "im", "scaramucci", "white", "scaramuccis", "yalls", "45", "house", "spicer", "turned", "chief", "man", "president", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning.

I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show.

Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding.

They wrote it into the Constitution. They codified it. They screamed for liberty and justice while blithely doing the opposite for centuries. Everything else\u2014Jim Crow, racism, the lynching epidemic that still infects the new-age fugitive slave hunters rebranded as \u201cpolice\u201d\u2014all stems from white people\u2019s theft of African bodies.\n\nThe remainder of the list is subjective. The order is an inconsequential exercise in semantics. But this week, white people did something to black people that cannot be ignored. And when I say \u201cwhite people,\u201d I mean all white people, because one of you could have done something to prevent this atrocity. One of you could have spoken out about it. You could have nipped this in the bud in its infancy, but you chose not to. Shame on you.\n\nOn Aug. 30, Danielle Bregoli, the 14-year-old who became famous on Dr. Phil for sucking in what her ratchet eyes perceived as black culture and vomiting up the putrid remnants of it with the nauseating catchphrase, \u201cCash me outside, how bow dah,\u201d released a new music video for her single \u201cThese Heaux.\u201d\n\nAnyway, here is the video:\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to watch it. I can explain it to you in one word: fuckery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a cacophony of stereotypes jumbled together by someone who obviously has hate and disregard for black people. From her nauseating Stepin Fetchit, wiggerish blackspeak to her hair, fingernails and lyrics being indistinguishable from a post-chocolate-milkshake and Taco Bell-chalupa diarrhea fart, everything about this is despicable.\n\nI could describe the video in detail, but that is not the point. It is not about the song, the video or even Danielle Bitcholi. It is about much more than this. It is about the reduction of a people into tomfoolery and ghetto tropes. It is about swallowing our culture, shitting out the undigestible parts, pointing at the turds and saying, \u201cLook what I ate. Blackness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what we see every time Miley Cyrus twerks. That\u2019s what we see every time Kim Kardashian West flashes her butt cheeks. That\u2019s what we see whenever Taylor Swift swipes the essence of Beyonc\u00e9, whitewashes it, serves it back up to Caucasian preteens and collects accolades for being a cutting-edge revolutionary with that affected \u201cAww, shucks\u201d grin on her smug face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you sense any animus in the tone of this writing, it is not because I am upset by Danielle Butholli screaming, \u201cNigger,\u201d in elementary-level rhymes over a catchy beat. I wouldn\u2019t give her the honor. I am not outraged. I am not bothered by it. It is even worse than that:\n\nI am used to it.\n\nThis week I wrote a tongue-in-cheek article about everything that bothers black people about some white women. A million people read it. Hundreds of thousands of people laughed at it. Thousands of people shared it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it made some white women furious that they were categorized in such a negative manner in a joking way. They emailed me. They called me out. They were upset because they are not accustomed to being negatively stereotyped. In their minds, how dare someone like me take the worst thing about a few white women and release the unflattering imagery into the world?\n\nBut the Danielle BreNazi video? It\u2019s funny. She\u2019s just a little girl having fun. Her 15 minutes of shame will be over soon. You\u2019re mad at that? Get over it?\n\nYou haven\u2019t seen or heard an outcry from anyone because we are used to it. We are accustomed to the thievery. We have gotten used to being shat upon. We have become numb to the shame of watching our collective likeness translated into an ugly caricature. It\u2019s why we overlook the slanderous portrayals as if they aren\u2019t injurious. It\u2019s why we don\u2019t throw a tantrum when politicians and do-gooders use \u201cunderprivileged\u201d as a synonym for \u201cblack\u201d while simultaneously denying the existence of white privilege. It\u2019s why we assume every police officer who murders a black boy will walk away scot-free before a verdict is even delivered. We are mostly unfazed. We are too tired to be outraged. We are conditioned for the abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is the worst thing white people have done to black people.", "keywords": ["worst", "danielle", "used", "thing", "shame", "wrote", "black", "white", "week", "happened", "video", "things", "women"], "polarity": -0.1258679653679654, "subjectivity": 0.44545995670995664},

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["mother", "case", "seeking", "parents", "daughter", "congolese", "immigration", "refuge", "detention", "lawsuit", "apart", "border", "separate", "post", "report", "torn", "explain", "policy"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

Maybe one day in the near future we will have a complete listing of the different kinds of Beckys, but for today, you should just know that according to the National Academy of White Women Arts and Sciences, Taylor Swift is rated as a Class C Becky, which is a midlevel ranking that corresponds to her milquetoast, passive-aggressive whiteness.\n\n\n\nFor comparison, if Swift were a drink, she\u2019d be a room temperature Mr. Pibb. If Swift were a dance, she\u2019d be the two-step. If Swift were sex, she\u2019d be a dude with his T-shirt and socks on fucking in the missionary position while the woman has her eyes closed with her hands on his chest to stop him from \u201cgoing too crazy.\u201d\n\nBut for all her alabaster averageness, Swift sits in the Beckydom somewhere between Megyn Kelly and the white woman at your job who secretly complained to HR when you wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on casual Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, Taylor Swift released the first single from her expected-to-be-a-hit album Reputation. Although no one has heard it, it is expected to be another compilation of angst-filled songs calling out her ex-boyfriends, and tunes waxing rhapsodic about how hard it is for a young, blond, millionaire white woman to get ahead in the world.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The album will be released on Nov. 10, which is (probably not) coincidentally 10 years after of the death of nemesis Kanye West\u2019s mother, Donda, to the exact day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you recall, Kanye and Taylor have a long history that dates back to Kanye interrupting Swift at the 2009 MTV Music Awards when she won Best Female Video over Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d I\u2019d like to point out that no one even remembers which song Swift won the award for, while \u201cIf you like it, then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it\u201d has cemented itself in the mainstream cultural lexicon.

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats.

What time of year, you ask? The time of year when President Racist von WallBuilder reads his prepared speech from a teleprompter, and a roomful of fat, rich white guys and affluent white women applaud as if the world were crafted from his tiny hands. This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W. Bush look palatable?\n\n\n\nBelow is a listing of planned protests that might even be effective if the president actually cared about the rest of the 99 percent.\n\n\n\nOff the top, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) aren\u2019t attending the president\u2019s address. Everyone knows that Auntie Maxine is not here to play nice with this president. Wilson and the president have never been on good terms, but that rift grew wider when the president reportedly told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that \u201che knew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d Wilson took offense at the heartless comment, and Trump, as he\u2019s been known to do, began attacking the congresswoman on Twitter. So when it came to this year\u2019s State of the Union, Wilson knew that the president didn\u2019t deserve her presence or her sweet cowboy hat!\n\n\n\n\u201cTo go would be to honor the president and I don\u2019t think he deserves to be honored at this time, after being so hateful towards black people and then black countries,\u201d she told CNN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeks had this to say about this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the New York Post reports: \u201cI cannot give this man, who does not respect me, the respect to be in that audience. I will not be there.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats who have noted that they won\u2019t be attending include Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.) and John Lewis (Ga.); Illinois Reps. Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) will be bringing Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victim Advocates, as his plus one; Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, will be a guest of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.); and Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who has researched and written about Taylor, will be a guest of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who went toe-to-toe with the president for his lack of concern after Hurricane Maria ravaged parts of Puerto Rico, will accompany Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nSeveral Congress members are using their invitations to bring faces of the immigration debate, specially those affected by the current stalemate over DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, affecting young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\n\nSome of the more prominent faces of the debate who will be in attendance: Cindy Garcia, the wife of Jorge Garcia, who was deported to Mexico earlier this month after living in the U.S. for 30 years. The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life.

Sadly, the frat\u2019s January 2017 inauguration probate show at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was poorly attended despite the fact that Chrisette Michele performed at the after-party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike most frat houses, the MAGA house is littered with McDonald\u2019s wrappers, guys who don\u2019t mind forcing themselves on pretty freshmen and a collection of party animals who never worry about studying.

It looked like a lot of fun!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is speculation that the entire fraternity could be kicked off the yard because of an ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller.

Conway eagerly answered, \u201cYes!\u201d before adding, \u201cThey can call me, by the way. They can call me.\u201d\n\nThat same publication is reporting that the team is so desperate to have star power that talent bookers say that they have been offered cash and in some cases ambassadorships in exchange for securing talent. One apparent insider explained, \u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Are you joking?' But no, it was serious.\u201d\n\nAnother was \u201cshocked\u201d at the proposal, noting, \u201cNever in a million years have I heard something so crazy. That was the moment I almost dropped the phone.\u201d\n\nIn response, committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn said in a statement:\n\n\n\nThere is no truth to this insinuation. First-class entertainers are eager to participate in the inaugural events. The inauguration as a whole will be an exciting and uniting celebration of freedom and democracy. We will be releasing further details at the appropriate time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are minuscule things that are constant in the seven-decade-spanning look at instability that is Donald Trump, but this one is true: The orange-skinned man loves to be around really famous people. Another: He is a damn liar. To that end, if Trump\u2019s transition committee is denying that they\u2019ve offered cash and ambassadorships in order to secure big-name singers, it\u2019s likely more true than it is false.\n\nHowever, not every talent booker or the talent themselves will operate with ethical codes similar to those The Wrap spoke to. So, to any entertainer considering performing at Trump\u2019s inauguration and de facto Klan rally, you best be careful of the consequences. This is especially true if you are black or an artist who dabbles heavily in black art forms.\n\nEarlier this month, Ne-Yo was asked by TMZ if he would perform at Trump\u2019s inauguration and said he would. \"I wouldn't go because I support Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI'd go because it's a dope party.\" Social media backlash immediately ensued, leaving the singer-songwriter to go to Instagram to declare that some people just couldn\u2019t take a joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you watch the clip in question, though, Ne-Yo first answered yes and was then told that his answer was different from Jamie Foxx\u2019s (who said he would not go). Ne-Yo went on to explain why he would do it. You know, \u201c\u2019cause a dope party is a dope party.\u201d But ha-ha-ha or whatever.\n\nNe-Yo learned his lesson fast all the same. It\u2019s one that other artists who swim around the same pop and R&B pools should heed as well. As much as I enjoy Bruno Mars, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon better not go doo-wop-pop-pop and shimmy for Bankruptcy Batista. Likewise, Justin Timberlake better take the invitation to call Conway about putting on a suit and tie for Minute Maid Mao and set it on fire. I dare the man who turned on Janet Jackson to insult black people to such a degree again.\n\nIf the fear of offending a diverse public bothered by the tangerine demagogue is not enough to say no, then one can also learn from the mistake made by Destiny\u2019s Child. Back in 2001, the group performed at George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration. Five years later, Beyonc\u00e9 was asked about her choice and whether it meant that she was a Republican. She said that she was not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to explain: \"I played at the inauguration because there were a lot of kids in the audience that I wanted to reach, that's all. Maybe one day I will speak of my political beliefs, but only when I know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nAs you can tell from the past election, the imagery in her work and her past performances, her views are now clear. Yet, in time, black people came to understand just how little regard Bush had for black people. To be fair, Bush at least put on airs as president-elect that he was a different kind of conservative and harbored no ill will toward black people and other racial minorities.\n\nWhen it comes to our next president, though, how he feels about blacks, Latinos, Muslims, women and the LGBTQ community is all quite clear. He doesn\u2019t deserve a big bash full of the ultrafamous and extraordinarily talented. He deserves the has-beens and never-really-had-its. To celebrate him and perform before him is to endorse his bigotry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a choice, one that warrants whatever consequences come as a result of it.\n\nStephen A.

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself. I just wish she wasn\u2019t alone.", "keywords": ["auntie", "administration", "seemingly", "waters", "stand", "know", "afraid", "shes", "maxine", "trump", "fight", "bad", "man", "willing", "trumps", "president"], "polarity": 0.03218294051627384, "subjectivity": 0.5180274971941637},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump not only fired the secretary of state\u2014and stand-in for every daytime soap opera\u2019s mean oil baron\u2014Rex Tillerson, but he also got rid of some guy named John McEntee, who was his personal assistant.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, McEntee was let go because of issues surrounding his security clearance. McEntee could be heard screaming, \u201cThis is bullshit! Jared Kushner\u2019s ass couldn\u2019t get clearance to ride on a Greyhound bus, but I\u2019m fired?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFine, McEntee wasn\u2019t heard screaming, but his ass was reportedly escorted out of the White House\u2014according to one official, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to take any of his belongings, not even his jacket\u2014because escorting people out of places where they have been fired is mad degrading and I\u2019m here for it. I want to have security at my next house party just so I can randomly walk through and ask that someone who doesn\u2019t use a coaster be escorted out and then look at them like an evil slave owner as they feebly attempt to explain with their eyes that it was all a mistake.\n\nDoes any of us know who McEntee is? Of course not. Does it matter that he\u2019s been fired? Well, kind of. The Trump administration has been a mess since infancy. Clearly the president is in over his head in policy he doesn\u2019t understand, and anyone who tries to tell him different is getting the big boot. Speaking of big boots, I\u2019m totally fine with cutting Florida off the map at any point ... because ... Florida.\n\nFlorida, Man You know how something happens in the news, and it\u2019s incredibly weird and far-fetched, and as you\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who care, McEntee had been with the president during his campaign, and he also carried a messenger bag over his shoulder and not across his body. Men who don\u2019t put the messenger-bag strap across their body can\u2019t be trusted, and McEntee\u2019s ill-advised handling of his messenger bag proves that he didn\u2019t deserve to be in the Beverly Hillbillies White House.\n\nA White House official told WSJ, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be great for morale.\u201d\n\nWelp, that\u2019s it, folks, nothing more to see here. McEntee was at the White House and now he isn\u2019t, and while none of us knew who he was, he will be missed. I guess. Also, something tells me that Trump isn\u2019t done letting people go. He\u2019s like the uncle who once threw three touchdowns in a junior varsity nonconference game and can\u2019t stop talking about it at every Thanksgiving even though he\u2019s 74 years old and was in high school in the 1950s.

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page.

Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C.

I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems.

Robert Rihmeek Williams is a Philadelphia man who many believe has been wrongly incarcerated by an overzealous judge who is using her influence and judicial power to keep the man down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who believe that Williams is being wrongly incarcerated will be the first to tell you that he isn\u2019t a saint, but he\u2019s no Meek Mill. Meek Mill murders on wax. Robert Rihmeek Williams has not murdered anyone. He\u2019s not a danger to society. He\u2019s not a criminal.\n\nOn records, Meek Mill has bodies and bricks.

I\u2019m one of them. Maybe it\u2019s the lyrics of some of Mill\u2019s greatest work that have a Philadelphia judge, Genece E. Brinkley, recently deeming Williams \u201ca danger to the community.\u201d Either way, Williams is in the bing, and if his lawyers can\u2019t get this judge thrown off the case, he won\u2019t be coming out anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the case and show how bizarre this whole thing has gotten.\n\nThe whole case started back in 2007 when Williams was just 18. The rapper still had braids, and anyone who\u2019s followed his career knows just how long ago this was.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in 2015, Williams said he was on his way to a corner store when cops stopped him and \u201cbeat the shit out of me.\u201d He still had the mug shot photo from the incident on his cellphone, which showed his face badly beaten.\n\n\u201c[I had] a concussion, stitches, braids ripped out. My blood was on the ceiling, on the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nPhiladelphia cops said he tried to shoot them. Williams said that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nDidn\u2019t matter. Williams was charged with assault, drug and gun possession. He was tried in 2008, and in January 2009, he was sentenced to 11-23 months in jail by Commons Pleas Judge Brinkley, who commented that she wanted the rapper to \u201cturn his life around from selling drugs and instead focus on his musical talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams served just five months of his initial sentence and was released in 2009 and given house arrest, which ended later that year. He was also given five years\u2019 probation.\n\nEverything that has happened since\u2014all the news about his incarceration and run-ins with the judge\u2014stems from this incident from when he was just 18 years old. And here\u2019s the thing: Every time Williams commits another infraction, any infraction, the judge adds more probation time to his sentence, meaning that although Williams is a free man, he\u2019s still living in a prison state.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Williams would test positive for weed and opioids, which wasn\u2019t bad enough to warrant probation violations, but the incidents began to be straws that broke the judge\u2019s back. In 2012, after Williams missed a couple of court dates, the judge ruled that because Williams couldn\u2019t make it to court, maybe he shouldn\u2019t be trusted with travel.\n\nThis appears to be the point when the relationship between Brinkley and Williams soured.\n\nAfter stating that there was nothing more important than appearing in her courtroom, the judge determined that Williams shouldn\u2019t be traveling if he couldn\u2019t make his court appearances. Williams\u2019 lawyer Joe Tacopina argued that as the rapper\u2019s success continued to rise, his schedule became more demanding. But Brinkley wasn\u2019t having it; she banned the star from going on the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how Billboard describes Williams\u2019 ascent and perpetual downfall in 2014:\n\n\n\nAfter his prison release, Meek Mill made it his duty to take his music seriously, which worked out in his favor as the rapper signed with Rick Ross\u2019 Maybach Music Group label in 2011. Meek showed promise with the release of his breakout track \u201cI\u2019m a Boss\u201d and his star continued to rise since as his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite all his success, the Philly native landed right back in courts in 2014 for violating his probation by booking performances outside of Philly without Judge Brinkley\u2019s approval. The rapper was sentenced to three to six months in jail. Meek began his stint in July and was released from prison in December 2014. He was put on parole and ordered to complete etiquette classes.\n\nEtiquette classes? Why?\n\nIt was \u201c(i)n order to address his inappropriate social media use and crude language in the courtroom,\u201d Brinkley wrote in court papers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently the judge wasn\u2019t keen on the rapper using foul language on social media, so she decided she was going to do something about it, and that something was etiquette classes.\n\n\u201cMultiple Philadelphia lawyers told [music website] Pitchfork they had never heard of a judge ordering a defendant to take etiquette classes, though they noted that for better or worse, judges\u2019 sentences are sometimes creative. For the next year, Meek attended court hearings every three months,\u201d Pitchfork reports.\n\nMost important, though, he was given an additional five years of probation.\n\nIn 2016, Williams would have several small infractions, including failing to meet with his probation officer and submitting cold water instead of urine during a drug test. The biggest infraction, and the one that really seemed to bother the judge, was that Williams again had traveled without her consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only problem with this is that if Williams, as a rapper, can\u2019t travel and perform songs while they\u2019re hot, how can he make money? Saying that a rapper can work but he can\u2019t leave his home state is like saying that I can write whatever I want, but I can\u2019t use a computer, pen, paper or phone.\n\n\n\nFor this infraction, he was given six to 12 months of house arrest, but the real injustice here is that he was given another six years of probation. Which means that Williams would have to appear before this judge for an additional six years, hoping that he wasn\u2019t thrown back in prison for the most minor misstep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, in 2017, Williams had two small infractions, and these are the crux of Brinkley\u2019s reasoning for sending Williams back to jail.\n\nAt an airport in St. Louis, an employee wanted to take a photo with Williams, who refused, resulting in one of Williams\u2019 entourage and the airport employee getting into a scuffle. Williams said that he was trying to break up the fight, but he was charged with misdemeanor assault. The assault charge was eventually dropped, but it was still cited in the judge\u2019s reasoning for why he should go back to jail.\n\n\n\nAfter the airport fight, Williams was in New York City to perform his aptly tilted song \u201cYBA (Young Black America)\u201d from his album Wins & Losses on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. The night before the performance, Williams and friends drove dirt bikes around Manhattan, during which, police witnessed Williams popping a wheelie. Williams was not arrested. In fact, he didn\u2019t get arrested until video of the infamous wheelie went viral on social media. Police then charged him with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA guy literally popped a wheelie for 10 seconds on the street with no one else around,\u201d Tacopina said in a video posted by TMZ. \u201cAnd the police were there. That\u2019s very important. The police were there, and they saw it, and they didn\u2019t arrest him. They didn\u2019t even give him a traffic ticket, but somehow the video made it to social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Meek accepted a plea deal that removes the charge from his record under the condition that he stay out of trouble for six months and complete community service.\n\nWhile all of these are probation violations, they are also the smallest of infractions that continue to have Williams in a perpetual prisoner state. Keep in mind that Williams is almost 30 years old, and because of his violations, he is still on probation from a case stemming from 2007!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if all of this isn\u2019t bizarre enough, let\u2019s also add that the judge in his case allegedly asked the rapper to remake the Boyz II Men love ballad \u201cOn Bended Knee\u201d and to name-drop the judge!\n\nWilliams\u2019 lawyers also say that she asked the rapper to leave Roc Nation management and sign with a friend of hers who they say has a checkered past. And the judge allegedly appeared at one of Williams\u2019 community service assignments to see if he was really there. The judge is now reportedly being investigated by the FBI for the way in which she\u2019s handled Williams\u2019 case.\n\nThe whole thing has been absurd.\n\nIn truth, the only person who seems to want to ensure that Williams stays in prison is the judge. In fact, during his last hearing before her court, not one person\u2014not the prosecutors, not the police, no one\u2014wanted him imprisoned for violations that didn\u2019t even amount to actual charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we see in the Meek Mill case is someone who can go to jail for a lengthy term for not committing a new crime, but doing things that most would deem mistakes,\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s top public defender, Keir Bradford-Grey, ttold WHYY. \u201cIf we want mass incarceration to end, we have to understand what it looks like, and his case does exemplify that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that Williams is freed for the crimes committed by Mill and that someday we can stop holding people in prison forever even after they\u2019ve served their time.", "keywords": ["prison", "explained", "mills", "judge", "probation", "meek", "months", "bizarre", "rapper", "court", "williams", "given", "incarceration", "case"], "polarity": 0.06775734716328777, "subjectivity": 0.39078364979355096},

Persky said he gave Turner that sentence because he thought that prison would have \u201ca severe impact on him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPublic outcry after the sentencing was immediate, and a recall effort was put in motion to remove Persky from the bench. The case also prompted California lawmakers to expand the definition of rape and pass new mandatory sentencing laws for convicted rapists.\n\nThe commission received thousands of complaints and petitions charging Persky with gender, race and economic bias, and allegations that a nonwhite, underprivileged defendant would have received a harsher sentence, the Times reports. Critics also said that because Persky played lacrosse at Stanford and graduated from there, he should have been disqualified from the case.\n\nThe commission said that Persky\u2019s sentencing was in line with a probation officer\u2019s recommendation and that his ties to Stanford were \u201cinsufficient to require disclosure or disqualification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission\u2019s ruling has not swayed those who are calling for Persky\u2019s removal from the bench.\n\nStanford Law professor Michelle Dauber, who is one among many calling for Persky\u2019s removal, said in a statement, \u201cThis report simply highlights what we have been saying from the beginning, which is that a petition for judicial discipline was not the correct venue to address these concerns, and the recall is the only realistic way to remove Judge Persky from office.\u201d\n\nDauber continued, \u201cWe believe that the record is completely clear that Judge Persky has a long record of failing to take violence against women seriously, and we will demonstrate when we launch the campaign early next year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe San Jose Mercury News reports that Persky has formed a committee to fight efforts to remove him from the bench, and his supporters, who include lawyers who have cases before him and California law school professors, say the recall effort is an overreaction that threatens judicial independence.\n\nFormer San Jose State political science professor Larry Gerston told the Mercury News that the commission\u2019s report is \u201cabsolutely terrific\u201d for the judge because he now has a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d from the panel.\n\n\u201cBut if the recall movement taps into the sense that there is a systemic problem with lackadaisical treatment of sex predators,\u201d Gerston said, \u201cthen people may say, \u2018We have to make an example of Judge Persky.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Los Angeles Times and the San Jose Mercury News.", "keywords": ["sentencing", "recall", "judge", "judicial", "sexual", "assault", "persky", "easy", "commission", "perskys", "california", "unconscious", "brock", "sentence", "gave", "cleared", "misconduct", "turner"], "polarity": 0.13602403343782654, "subjectivity": 0.43546051649499923},

That is how long I\u2019ve been sick with an unknown virus (the thing doctors tell you when they don\u2019t know what it is but know it won\u2019t kill you). It\u2019s not the flu. It\u2019s not a cold. But it is one thing\u2014a jerk. Just the biggest jerk of a disease ruining my social life by forcing me to be actually antisocial, much like the name of this column.\n\nAntisocial is the events-and-society column for people allergic to society, aka those with social anxiety disorder, so it\u2019s not as if I needed an actual disease to give me a reason to stay home. I come up with plenty of excuses to stay in the house\u2014it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too cold, it\u2019s too \u201coutside\u201d\u2014whatever works. But I had actually been looking forward to the spate of events I had lined up over the last two weeks to crash. Page Six TV\u2019s party. A YouTube-Elle Magazine function. So many Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference panels and events in Washington, D.C. All missed because I was too busy hacking and coughing in my prison of used Kleenex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is my first time being ill in more than two years, ruining my pristine streak of good health, all of which was fueled (mostly) by a flu shot I took back in 2015 and some really good luck, considering that New York City is a germophobe\u2019s nightmare fuel. I\u2019m supposed to travel back to D.C. later this week for my 40th birthday, but the way this sickness is going, who knows what will happen come Friday? Can I even travel? I could\u2019ve almost died in my hotel room during CBC week because I choked on a cold tablet that got lodged in my throat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of my more than 18 days of sinus infection, I decided to take a break from being sick and pretended to be well because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Black & White Champagne Brunch with the New York Urban League at La Marina in New York City on Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the brunch, which was hosted by actress and body-positive advocate RaVal Davis. Charter Communications Vice President of State Government Affairs Camile Joseph Goldman was being honored with the David N. Dinkins Award for Service, Leadership and Social Justice at the event, which also featured performances by NAACP Theater Award-winning actress and singer Sha\u2019Leah Nikole.\n\nShe performed Roberta Flack\u2019s classic by way of the Fugees, \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d as I ate eggs and bacon, feeling proud of my ability to actually throw together a halfway decent outfit that didn\u2019t make me feel that I unnecessarily stood out in a bad way, but still blended in with the overall theme of everyone in black and white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemarks were made by NYUL President and CEO Arva R. Rice and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), as well as Goldman, who gave a spirited and impassioned speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was mostly thankful that it wasn\u2019t a dreaded \u201cwhite party\u201d (black people love white parties, where you dress in all white, get turnt and look like drunken angels), because I hate wearing all white with a passion. The absence of color does nothing for my complexion and is almost as dreaded as wearing all black, which makes me look like I (still) work at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\n\nPer usual, I had no business cards on me because they were still in the mail at the time and my old cards were lost more than a year ago in my move to New York City. (They did show up in time for CBC week, meaning that a bunch of people now have my work number, filling me with a special kind of anxiety.)\n\nThis made me garner a look from New York society columnist Audrey J. Bernard, whom I\u2019d watched chastise a young woman who approached me a few weeks ago at a New York Fashion Week event wanting to write for The Root and had no business cards. To be honest, I find that when I receive business cards, I never do absolutely anything with them unless the person is someone I\u2019m desperately, constantly forgetting the name of. Then I hold on to the card as if I\u2019m hoping the name will be absorbed into my porous brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m notoriously bad with names. Chances are, if you know me and I know you but we\u2019re not close enough to be besties, I don\u2019t actually know your name even though I\u2019ve met you several times, seen you at multiple events and recognize you easily. I used to have a publisher, Virginia Moorhouse\u2014whose family owns the Bakersfield Californian newspaper, where I worked for five years\u2014who was fantastic at remembering everyone\u2019s name, an incredible, enviable skill.\n\nI try all the tricks, repeating the name back to them, introducing them to friends so they have to say their name\u2014nothing really works except for this one time when I ran into a guy (who also probably didn\u2019t know my name, either, to be honest) in the airport and I remembered his entire life story but not his name, so I went home and furiously Googled his job and searched for his name and picture until it popped up, then just kept walking around my apartment, repeating the name back to myself like a lunatic.\n\nWhich brings me to CBC in Washington, where I was talking to Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Panama Jackson, a senior editor here at The Root, and he was also complaining about how he knew no one\u2019s name. How he would know people, kick it with people at parties and still have no idea what they\u2019re called. He wondered if something was wrong with him or if he was just self-centered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI told him I was the same way and that he was likely just self-centered, since I\u2019m sure that is my issue. I\u2019m often too busy thinking about whatever the personal malady of the day is to know what anyone\u2019s name is, lost in my own head. I may be present with you in the moment, talking, smiling, laughing, but am I really there? Or am I lost in my own head, wondering about this and that? It\u2019s annoying and probably one of my least favorite things about myself. I want to be in the moment, but I\u2019m easily distracted by my own internal drama.\n\nEvery year for the past 47 years, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has thrown a conference in D.C. that attracts thousands of black people from across the nation to talk policy and community issues, then fight to get into many of the exclusive parties going on around the main event. I was too sick for most of the conference, barely making it through panels\u2014faring poorly with a panel The Root\u2019s Jason Johnson and Panama were on about the importance of the black press, but faring a bit better during a panel on the film Black Panther that featured director Ryan Coogler and an exclusive five-minute clip from the film.\n\nI spent most of the conference just trying not to die, but managed to pull it together for a discussion between St. Louis\u2019 own, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (she\u2019s from Kinloch, Mo., to be precise), and BET\u2019s newest late-night talk show host, Robin Thede, soon to be starring in The Rundown With Robin Thede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was excited to attend this event and to meet Robin because we have something in common: We were both black-lady head writers for late-night talk shows\u2014she is formerly of Larry Wilmore\u2019s show on Comedy Central, and I am formerly of BET\u2019s previous late-night outing Don\u2019t Sleep Hosted by T.J. Holmes.\n\nMy foray into late-night TV was very (very!) short-lived. The show lasted only four months back in 2012. T.J. has since moved on to Good Morning America on ABC, and I\u2019m obviously here at The Root, holding it down. I wished Robin all the best with her show (and told her I\u2019d love to do a feature on her for The Root), and judging by how well she handled her interview with Waters\u2014it was funny and insightful\u2014I have a feeling she might last much, much longer than our four months of ratings-based struggle! (But we did get this sweet write-up in the New York Times!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for all the other activities that happened during CBC, I left all of those for everyone else to enjoy, since I spent nearly every night in my hotel room quietly wondering why I traveled to D.C. while sick on a germ-filled Amtrak train, resickening myself and making my illness worse. I left all the real partying to my friend Jason, who did all the things I would have done had I been well\u2014like be bold enough to crash parties I wasn\u2019t invited to in order to see T.I. and Babyface perform at separate galas. I ended up giving away my ticket to the coveted Black Party (hosted by La La Anthony and featuring Doug E. Fresh) to my best friend, Jada Prather, so I could go back to my hotel and die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, I almost did! The following morning, I attempted to take some cold medication and choked on the pill. It got caught up in my throat and would NOT dislodge despite all the coughing, hacking and vomiting I did. Fearing that I would die, I called the front desk and attempted to tell them, \u201cSend help, I\u2019m choking!\u201d For some reason, they misinterpreted this but did send up a gentleman who, upon looking at me hacking and coughing with mucus running from my nose, took off running in the other direction, shouting on his walkie-talkie to the front desk. I was hoping he\u2019d help me out with a Heimlich or something, but no.\n\nSo I was left gagging and contemplating whether this was the end. That the sum of my life would conclude with me asphyxiating on a very large DayQuil gel cap, in a T-shirt and underwear, in a hotel room in D.C. All I kept thinking was, \u201cThis is a stupid, stupid way to die.\u201d I also thought a lot about the HBO show Six Feet Under, which had an episode once in which a woman choked to death on food in her apartment, and how I always feared this happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I thought about dying, my father, Six Feet Under and how dumb this was. A dumb way to die. I couldn\u2019t die like this. I had to calm down and attempt to breath through all the coughing and heaving so I wouldn\u2019t black out.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, the pill started to break down and dissolve in my throat, probably from all the vomiting of stomach acid (it was very early in the morning and I hadn\u2019t eaten yet). The hotel sent several more people up to my room to check on me, including the paramedics, who had been told that someone \u201cfell.\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, I was choking.\u201d So the paramedics cracked a few jokes and left.\n\nAfter everyone determined that no one had died at the Hyatt Place in \u201cNoMa\u201d (lol at that name), I was left to my own devices, whereupon I sat in my room and cried until Jason called me and invited me to breakfast, where I recounted to him my brush with death in a hoarse voice that could barely get out words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, I ate this Breakfast Bandit bagel sandwich at Buffalo & Bergen in Union Market.\n\nIt was delicious, but I was still teary and miserable, and I wanted to document the first thing I attempted to eat after almost dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemed important.\n\nThankfully, I am not dead, but still on the mend from my illness. I have a whole spate of events lined up in October that I will hopefully be much more healthy and present for. Hopefully. Maybe. Perhaps.

Two men riding bicycles happened upon the scene, tackled Turner and held him down until police came.\n\nTurner, 20, was found guilty of the assault, and at his sentencing hearing, Doe read her powerful 12-page letter that told her side of events. A judge sentenced Turner to six months in jail, saying that a longer sentence would have \u201ca severe impact on him.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csevere impact\u201d of Turner\u2019s actions on Doe resonated around the world. According to Glamour, within four days, her statement had been read 11 million times. It was read aloud on CNN and on the floor of Congress.

His attorneys filed a motion for bail on Nov. 16, but Judge Genece Brinkley has yet to issue a ruling on that motion.\n\nOn Monday, Meek\u2019s attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition, claiming that Brinkley was ignoring Meek\u2019s post-sentencing motions and making it impossible for him to file an appeal, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania Superior Court denied the rapper\u2019s request to be freed from prison and allowed to post bail, it ruled that Brinkley should immediately rule on Meek\u2019s previous request, saying, \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas is directed to enter a disposition of petitioner\u2019s Nov. 16, 2017, motion for bail without further delay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrinkley sentenced Meek Mill to prison earlier this month after a drug test came back positive for the prescription drug Percocet and the rapper was arrested twice this year\u2014once for an altercation in a St. Louis airport and again for popping wheelies on a motorcycle in New York.\n\nThe criminal charges in both of those arrests were later dropped, but the judge determined that the mere fact he was arrested violated the terms of his probation. She sentenced him to prison even though both a prosecutor and Meek\u2019s probation officer recommended that he not be jailed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Meek\u2019s attorney Joe Tacopina said: \u201cWe are pleased that the Superior Court took immediate action to direct the Court of Common Pleas to decide on the application for bail \u2018without further delay.\u2019 We remain hopeful that Mr. Williams will be promptly released on bail.\u201d\n\nOn Monday the Rev. Al Sharpton visited Meek at the prison in Chester, Pa.

Nearly two decades ago, Walter Dean Myers\u2019 young-adult novel approached a racist court system that paints African-American men as guilty \u201cmonsters\u201d before any evidence is presented. Sadly, this concept holds true as former music video director-turned-first-time filmmaker Anthony Mandler (Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cIrreplaceable,\u201d Jay-Z \u201cRun This Town\u201d and Rihanna \u201cDiamonds,\u201d among others) fittingly updates Myers\u2019 work to the big screen with Monster.\n\n\n\nThe film follows the trial of 17-year-old Steve Harmon (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who may or may not have been involved in a convenience store robbery that left an innocent man murdered. Although it\u2019s up to a jury to decide Harmon\u2019s fate, a cloud of guilt is already hovering over the honor student\u2019s head, regardless of his middle-class upbringing and aspirations to escape Harlem for a career in film.\n\n\u201cI knew that this story was important,\u201d Mandler explains to The Root with regard to why he decided that this adaptation would be his first film. \u201cHaving the opportunity to work with the headline \u2018Can one decision define my whole life?\u2019 as we watch a 17-year-old black kid sit in jail and defend his innocence against a system that is set up for him to lose through the lens of [a] crooked criminal-justice system was attractive.\u201d\n\nMonster is told using flashbacks that construct Harmon\u2019s life up to the point of the alleged crime, and what we see is an all-too-familiar story involving minority youths where being at the wrong place at the wrong time can end up costing an individual his or her life.\n\nMandler is fortunate to have Harrison anchoring the role of Harmon because he turns in an excellent performance that leaves the viewer straddling the fence of whether or not Harmon had anything to do with the robbery that went wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wanted a face that was complex, with an internal dialog that was tough to read,\u201d Mandler says of Harrison\u2019s nuanced performance. \u201cI needed somebody who could toggle between vulnerability while not being too street. I needed somebody who came from a two-parent household. You can always tell because you can see the feminine and masculine in them. And the ridiculous clich\u00e9 of the broken black family in Harlem, we wanted nothing to do with that.\u201d\n\nMuch of the film is focused on Harrison\u2019s expressions throughout the trial, in the streets of Harlem and in prison. Mandler makes the conscious decision to train the camera on his main character\u2019s reactions to the horrors of being a teenager incarcerated with grown men rather than film the atmosphere surrounding him.\n\nEven as the character Harmon interacts with the soon-to-be murderers\u2014which include a magnetic performance from A$AP Rocky as King and John David Washington as Bobo\u2014and the students in his film class, the camera often lingers long on his face as we try to read his thoughts through his expressions. Is he warming up to the idea of the fast life or is he simply toggling between two worlds in order to save face?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating exploration that will likely resonate with many African-American men and women who have grown up around similar situations where one wrong turn can ruin your future. As for Harrison\u2014who had feature roles in three movies at Sundance\u2014he recognizes roles like this as a form of activism.\n\n\u201cMonster was my platform to discuss subjects like mass incarceration and how the criminal-justice system treats young black men, and that\u2019s my version of activism,\u201d Harrison says.\n\nMandler assembled a strong cast, which includes the likes of Jeffrey Wright, Jennifer Hudson, Nas, Jennifer Ehle and Tim Blake Nelson. But it is Harrison\u2019s performance that will keep you engaged. Not because he occupies the majority of the camera time, but because he\u2019s incredibly alluring and the pulse to a narrative that isn\u2019t necessarily reinventing the wheel (HBO\u2019s The Night Of told a similar story).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an effort to stay true to the book, Monster features narration from the protagonist, who uses his time in prison to pen a screenplay. Unfortunately, the use of Harmon\u2019s narration does come off disjointed at times. The young-adult novel is part script, part diary and part narrative, and Mandler does his best to keep all of those remnants intact, regardless of how it affects the overall film.\n\n\u201cWe were very careful to protect as much of the book as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to update things from 1999, such as the use of cellphones and security cameras, but all in all, it was about protecting the source material.\u201d\n\nAlthough the film is anchored by Harrison\u2019s strong performance, Monster isn\u2019t without its flaws. Jennifer Hudson, who plays Harmon\u2019s mother, feels underutilized and extraordinarily one-dimensional. Jeffrey Wright doesn\u2019t suffer from the same issue, since his role as Harmon\u2019s father feels fully formed even though he shares roughly the same amount of camera time as Hudson. The same can\u2019t be said of Harmon\u2019s film-class friends and his love interest (played by Lovie Simone), who are all there for atmospheric purposes but don\u2019t really lend much to the film or to Harmon\u2019s development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose qualms aside, there is a gripping story about a young man who will likely have his life changed forever at the heart of the film\u2019s 112-minute quest for the truth.\n\n\u201cThere are no winners in this movie,\u201d Mandler says. \u201cInnocence or guilt, everyone\u2019s lives have changed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the troubling part about this narrative. Regardless of whether Harmon is innocent or guilty, there is no doubt that his time in prison and the duration of his trial will peel layers away from his soul that he\u2019ll never have returned to him. It is what Harrison manages to project extraordinarily well that will leave viewers scarred by the time the credits roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI hope they see the complexity of a young black kid at 17,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying he got caught up in the wrong game and went to prison. Steve comes from a good family with a certain level of privilege, but he had to learn that he\u2019s not exempt from the system, and that\u2019s something that we all have to recognize.\u201d", "keywords": ["kelvin", "performance", "novelturnedsundance", "youngadult", "monster", "mandler", "prison", "powerful", "breakout", "harmons", "harrison", "harmon", "jrs", "wrong", "system", "film", "men"], "polarity": 0.0786924603174603, "subjectivity": 0.5379464285714285},

DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness. So her visit to Parkland wasn\u2019t any more or any less useless than usual. Her uselessness is both hilarious and dangerous\u2014oh so fucking dangerous\u2014but it does have integrity. You won\u2019t catch her being useful when no one\u2019s looking. Nope. Her useless has more character than that.\n\nBut, please, don\u2019t shed any tears for useless little Betsy. America has and even creates space for useless white people to survive and thrive. If this secretary of education thing doesn\u2019t work out, she could always follow the footsteps of other useless white women and maybe sue the University of Texas for not admitting her. Or perhaps she could be a rapper. The sky is the limit for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, that\u2019s a lie. Jared Kushner is her ceiling, because she\u2019ll never be more useless than he is.

In its report, the GAO made its assessment of MWO-firm access to all of them.\n\nFederal employees pay into federal plans from their salaries during their careers, and asset managers invest funds so that they build equity. Some of these entities include the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Federal Reserve System and the National Railway Retirement Investment Trust. Representatives from the GAO interviewed decision-makers from these entities to determine how well they were working to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned asset-management firms.\n\nVerdict: not good at all.\n\nIn some instances, none of the plans used MWO firms. Others used vey few. At BlackRock, a publicly traded asset-management firm that oversees three federal plans, just 1.6 percent of its managers are African American, while 81.5 percent are white; 13.5 percent are Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the reasons minority- or women-owned businesses don\u2019t get as much of the asset-management pie is that, unless an entity specifically asks for a minority- or women-owned firm, consultants tasked with job searches will not even consider them, according to the report. Another issue is that there is a bias against using MWO firms because it is assumed that they will not perform as well as white ones, even though there is no data backing up that assumption, the report found. The GAO cited industry studies that reveal there is no difference between the performance of an MWO and a non-MWO firm.\n\nThe lack of opportunities that minority-owned firms get to handle federally managed dollars should concern Congress and Americans in general, said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\n\u201cFederal employees are paying into this, and federal employees reflect the wonderful diversity of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have high-quality, strong-performing [asset] managers who don\u2019t give [MWO firms] a shot to manage some of these funds, it flies in the face of our values as a nation of equal opportunities and inclusion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Booker arrived in Washington in 2013, tackling asset-management diversity in contracting was one of the first issues he took on. A year later, he and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) held a summit with pension-fund administrators to find out why there were so few MWO firms getting a shot to manage federal assets.\n\nOne issue is that the process of how to apply for contracts is not very clear or made readily available to prospective minority-owned firms. Firm size is another challenge. Institutional investors often require firms to have a minimum of threshold assets under management\u2014usually $1 billion, at the very least; liability insurance; as well as lengthy track records that smaller firms usually do not have.\n\nBut the dearth of ethnic and gender diversity is not the only issue with having federal assets managed by a select few firms. A major concern for Meeks is the potential for a security breach of a firm managing a lion\u2019s share of assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have a cyber breach of that firm, it would impact all of the federal employees,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cBut if you broke it down so that you had many small firms, it would not have an effect over the broad scope of everyone, and it better diversifies what those risks may be.\u201d\n\nAs bleak as the report\u2019s findings were, there were some recommendations for improvement. Federal investment entities could create minority-centered competitions that are marketed to firms that historically have been excluded from federal bidding. Adjusting high thresholds for assets under management, liability insurance and years of management experience would ensure that smaller firms were eligible to apply.\n\nThe report emphasized that the leadership of pension funds and various government plans has to prioritize diversity, and the consultants hired to search for asset managers have to diversify their Rolodexes beyond their typical recruiting pools. Meeks stressed that adjusting these thresholds isn\u2019t the same as lowering standards. To the contrary, it is about access to the bidding process that is proportionate to a firm, regardless of size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked what he and his colleagues would do to ensure that MWO firms get federal asset-management jobs in the future, Booker said that he would continue challenging fund administrators to accept the GAO\u2019s recommendations on diversifying the firms that are handing their assets.\n\n\u201cIf they have such little amounts of diversity or do not have a [diversity] program, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe more we can shine a light on the problem and demonstrate there are constructive things they could be doing, the more quickly we\u2019re going to see changes being made.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["firm", "meeks", "mwo", "minority", "assetmanagement", "plans", "diversity", "contracts", "firms", "getting", "report", "federal"], "polarity": 0.026336545399045397, "subjectivity": 0.3772763000888001},

Lesser (AP Images)\n\nI was perusing the internet streets like I always do looking for what\u2019s good in the hood when I came across an article from BuzzFeed that made me clutch my pearls, then touch my chest and say, \u201cWhy, I never!\u201d The headline? \u201cWe Found the Girl Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song and Sis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nThe article, penned by BuzzFeed staff writer Essence Gant, is one of those joints that I assume was written by somebody young(er)\u2014according to this the Life Currency interview, she\u2019s likely 31 now\u2014who maybe came across Living Single more recently and was excited and enthused about the lives of Khadijah, Max, Regine, Synclaire, Overton and Kyle and probably binged the show after it was made available on Hulu back in January.\n\nNothing about this is a bad thing. It is a great show and bingeworthy, and the theme music and the opening dance number are awesome. My guess is that the writer took a shining to the intro and was like, \u201cI wonder who that is. I\u2019m a writer; let me dig into the crates.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, those of us who grew up in the \u201990s, both on and with hip-hop, know and have always known that it was Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar in that dance number. Her silhouette was distinctive and we knew her from hosting Rap City, acting and choreographing videos for damn near everybody\u2014from Michael Jordan to Mary J. Blige. While I\u2019m not going to pretend that Big Lez was a mainstream household name, in the hip-hop world (a large part of the target demo for Living Single), we knew Big Lez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to me clutching my pearls and shit. When I read the headline that referred to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl,\u201d I felt like some unintentional shade was being thrown. I say unintentional because if you read the actual article (who does that?) you\u2019ll see that Ms. Gant thinks highly of Big Lez:\n\nAfter digging around the internet, we found out that the infamous choreographer is Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar, @yourgirllez on Instagram, and sis is #skingoals, #fitgoals, all the goals.\n\nShe\u2019s been a professional dancer and has worked with some of music\u2019s biggest legends. This video of her and Mary J. Blige is the cutest #blackgirlmagic nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s Big Lez, famed VJ who had some classic interviews and episodes of Rap City. She\u2019s a real basket of kittens and always has been. So again, I\u2019m sure Gant knows this and feels this and means no harm by referring to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl\u201d\u2014hell, the title ends with \u201cSis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nBut would it have been that much trouble to add her name to the title instead of making it seem like she was just some woman who danced in the intro and wasn\u2019t a somebody BEFORE she did that? We knew who she was. By \u201cwe,\u201d I mean hip-hop. In my view, calling her \u201cthe girl\u201d diminishes her star. It implies that most people\u2014or likely most people who read BuzzFeed\u2014wouldn\u2019t register her name enough to warrant mentioning it.\n\nEven still, \u201cWe Found Big Lez, Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song, and Sis Looks Good as Hell\u201d works just as well as the current title, no? I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to, and I wager many folks don\u2019t. But not even calling her by her name? That feels unnecessarily disrespectful. But maybe I\u2019m making a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe it\u2019s just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m gonna take it as disrespect, even if it\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m not going to turn it into a larger discussion about marginalizing black women; after all, the author of the \u201carticle\u201d is a black woman.\n\nAlso, you see how I put the word \u201carticle\u201d in quotes? Here\u2019s the situation: I\u2019m not sure if the source piece is actually an article\u2014the letters are huge, there are tons of hashtags, and it\u2019s largely GIFs and pictures. Hell, it\u2019s basically a list of pictures with lots of captions. But it\u2019s a byline, so it\u2019s an article, right? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to not call it one\u2014get your money, girl\u2014but me adding those quotes makes it seem like I\u2019m mocking or belittling, basically being disrespectful. But I don\u2019t mean it that way.\n\nAnyway, is it me? Am I tripping?

He allegedly grabbed the owner, a 39-year-old white woman, from behind in the empty store and raped her twice at gunpoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe victim never clearly saw her attacker\u2019s face.\n\nIn February 1980, Alexander had a consensual sexual encounter with a white woman who asked him for money and later accused him of sexual assault.\n\nEven though the woman\u2019s charges were unsubstantiated and no charges were ever filed against Alexander, authorities had his photo on file.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s all they needed.\n\nGretna police showed the antique-store owner Alexander\u2019s picture, and she \u201ctentatively\u201d identified him as her assailant out of hundreds of photos shown to her. Three days later, police placed Alexander in a lineup, and by that time, the store owner was \u201csure\u201d that he was the man who had attacked her.\n\nThis was four months after she was attacked in the dark, from behind, at gunpoint. Alexander was the only man in the lineup whose picture had also been in the photo array.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Innocence Project:\n\nResearch has shown that multiple identification procedures can contaminate a witness\u2019s memory, causing a witness to become confused about whether he or she recognizes the person from the event or the earlier procedure, while also making the witness more confident in his or her identification.\n\nAfter a trial that lasted one day\u2014during which Alexander\u2019s attorney, Joseph Tosh, failed to make an opening statement or call any witnesses for the defense, and failed to adequately cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses about the identification\u2014Alexander was sentenced to life in prison on Dec. 10, 1980.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, he never stopped insisting that he was innocent.\n\nAlexander reached out to the Innocence Project in 1996, and the organization quickly discovered that critical DNA evidence had been destroyed only four years into his sentence.\n\nAlexander\u2019s freedom felt like an impossible dream, but in 2013, there was a break in the case. Pubic hair recovered from the antique store where the rape took place was found at the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Crime Lab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hairs belonged to neither Alexander nor the victim. This fact, along with Alexander\u2019s lack of competent counsel and the flawed identification procedure, was enough for Judge Darensburg to overturn his conviction.\n\n\u201cThe stakes in this case couldn\u2019t have been higher for Mr. Alexander, who faced a mandatory sentence of life without parole, yet the attorney that he entrusted with his life did next to nothing to defend him,\u201d said Vanessa Potkin, post-conviction litigation director at the Innocence Project, which is affiliated with the Cardozo School of Law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is simply unconscionable,\u201d she continued. \u201cMr. Alexander was just 21 years old when he was convicted after a trial that began and ended all in the same day.

You will never find a plainer, less sophisticated, and easier to grasp example of these particular strains of pervasive shitty. Anyone who reads the details of this story and still comes away unconvinced these things exist is either trolling, a member of the Turner family, or \"Simple Jack's\" replacement for the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, you can't make a fuckshit souffl\u00e9 without the proper ingredients. And this had them all. The foundation, of course, was the rape Brock Turner committed. He was found on top of an unconscious woman outside of a Kappa Alpha fraternity house. When discovered, he attempted to run away, but was apprehended by two students who happened to be passing by. It's particularly telling that he tried to flee, as that act cuts through the argument of anyone (Turner and his father included) who claims to sincerely believe there's nothing wrong with raping a woman unable to provide consent. He knew what he was doing was wrong; he just attempted to spin it into less of a wrong after he got caught.\n\nNot satisfied that the souffle had enough seasoning, Turner prepared and read a statement that blamed \"campus drinking culture\" for his act; even having the audacity to center himself as the primary victim, as he claimed she was conscious the entire time. It was like he had a rape culture dartboard and attempted to hit every target.\n\nTurner's fuckshit, however, was demonstratively refuted in a statement read by the woman he victimized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Jezebel:\n\n\n\n\u201cI fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can\u2019t even see that distinction.\u201d\n\nFollowing Turner's conviction, the prosecutors recommended six years. This is when Judge Persky took the souffle out of the oven, tasted it, and said \"You know what this fuckshit souffle is missing? A dollop of White privilege. Actually forget a dollop. This needs a quart of that shit.\" This resulted in a six-month sentence, with Persky's rationale being that a \"prison sentence would have a severe impact on him\" and that \"I think he will not be a danger to others.\" Let's forget for a moment that the point of putting rapists in prison is for it to have a severe impact on them. If you want to be moderately impacted by something, eat a Chipotle burrito, get on the elliptical, and feel it moderately impact your digestive system. Also let's even forget that Turner still hasn't taken any real blame or possessed any real remorse for his act. Perhaps he's not dangerous to other men, but he's definitely dangerous to women. He is a remorseless and privileged rapist who received an \"eh\" punishment for his crime. This is the very definition of dangerous motherfucker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, let's focus on what Persky claimed to base his decision on: Turner's age and lack of a criminal history. And then ask yourselves if there's any doubt whatsoever that Turner wouldn't have received the same deal if he possessed the same age and the same lack of a criminal history, but happened to look like Kimbo Slice (RIP).\n\nNot to be outdone, Dan Turner (Brock's father) smelled the fuckshit souffle baking, walked into the kitchen, opened the oven door, grabbed some oven mitts, pulled it out, placed it on the counter, stuck a serving spoon in it, tasted the still burning hot souffle, and thought \"This meal is almost done. All it's missing is another gallon or two of White privilege. And possibly gallon or two of rape culture too.\"\n\nThe result: A ridiculously tone-deaf, bizarre, myopic, and just fucked-up-as-all-the-fucks letter where he claimed Turner's bitch-ass sentence is a \"steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.\u201d Which ignores the fact that 20 minutes is a long ass time. Far more than enough time to rape and steal and mug and murder. You could murder 20 kittens in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also stated that Turner's life is an anxiety-ridden, fearful, and depressing mess. Which is exactly what many actual rape victims experience after they're raped by people like Brock Turner. And, if this epitome of shitty surreality wasn't enough, he went on a tangent about the food this motherfucker loved to grill and how the results of all the raping he was doing wouldn't allow him to enjoy grilling anymore. (Seriously. He actually said that out of his own actual mouth. Read that shit for yourself.)\n\nA part of me felt somewhat sympathetic towards Dan Turner, because he's just attempting to defend his boy. But then I thought about my own dad, who loves me as much as a father can love a son. And then I thought about what my dad would do if he heard that I was discovered raping a woman behind a dumpster; a devious, disgusting, lecherous, and deviant criminal act that ruined this woman's life and ruined my academic and athletic career. And then, I thought about how after I regained consciousness from the coma he'd put me in, I'd likely overhear him telling the judge \"yeah, he's my son and I love him, but that nigga deserves a few years in prison to give him a consequence for this terrible act. But mostly to keep him away from me randomly kicking his bitch-ass ass for the next decade.\" And then the shred of sympathy I considered possessing for Dan Turner withered away.\n\nAlmost complete, the fuckshit souffle needed one more thing: a few tablespoons of White privilege cake batter and vanilla frosting on top of it. This came in the form of a mugshot, or lack thereof. While Black people involved with some sort of legal and/or criminal issue \u2014 even Black people actually victimized by the police \u2014 regularly have their mugshots circulated, Brock Turner's smiling and suited up yearbook photo was the prevailing image of him. Until yesterday, when the Santa Clara Sheriff\u2019s Department finally released two mugshots of Turner; one from the night he was arrested, and one from his sentencing last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it. The easiest way to make the perfect fuckshit souffle; complete with numerous generous helpings of rape culture and White privilege.

Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["juror", "mcknight", "justice", "joe", "black", "woman", "white", "nfl", "parish", "jury", "player", "jefferson", "shooting", "gasser", "help"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

I was a number.\u201d\n\nAccording to the site, Banks has been watching the Stanford rape case closely and couldn\u2019t help noticing Turner\u2019s much lighter sentencing, despite the fact that, like Turner, Banks did not have a criminal history.\n\nBanks was 16 when he said he was making out with a 15-year-old girl in 2002. By the end of the day, he was accused of rape and was ultimately tried as an adult. He was sent to juvenile hall for a year before his case came up, and then he was facing 41 years to life in prison. At first Banks, knowing that he did not commit the crime, turned down plea deals for 25, 18 and nine years in prison. He then agreed to go through 90 days of observation in Chico State Prison after his lawyer told him he would then get probation. He said that he was told that it was the best option as a black kid facing an all-white jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge, however, handed Banks a six-year sentence.\n\n\u201cIt was like he was ordering McDonald\u2019s at a drive-thru window,\u201d Banks told the Daily News. \u201cIt was like he was ordering food and took off.\u201d\n\nBy the time Banks\u2019 accuser recanted her claims, it was 2012 and Banks had already served five years and two months in prison and five years of high-custody parole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn comparison, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky did not sentence Turner to prison and didn\u2019t even come close to the maximum 14 years that the 20-year-old could have received for his crimes.\n\n\u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\u201d Persky decided in a ruling that outraged social media users. \u201cI think he will not be a danger to others.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a case of privilege,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIt seems like the judge based his decision on lifestyle. \u2018He\u2019s lived such a good life and has never experienced anything serious in his life that would prepare him for prison. He was sheltered so much he wouldn\u2019t be able to survive prison.\u2019 What about the kid who has nothing? He struggles to eat, struggles to get a fair education? What about the kid who has no choice who he is born to and has drug-addicted parents or a nonparent household? Where is the consideration for them when they commit a crime?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBanks said that he was \u201csurprised\u201d the courts found a way to consider Turner\u2019s lifestyle and that \u201che wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with career criminals.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know a man is guilty, so why aren\u2019t we unleashing half of the punishment that was unleashed on Brian Banks, when he was innocent and there was no evidence?\u201d Banks said. \u201cThey gave me six years. They gave him six months.\u201d\n\nBanks, who now works with the NFL\u2019s Los Angeles office, also spoke out on behalf of Turner\u2019s victim, saying that she \u201chas been totally ignored.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe has to live with her hardship and tragedy for the rest of her life,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Banks had 10 years taken away from him, losing his college scholarship and a possible career in the NFL for a crime he did not commit.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t physically raped, but I was raped in a sense of my freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cI was kidnapped, taken against my will, placed in a box for five years and two months. I was denied all human rights. When I screamed and pleaded and begged, it fell on deaf ears. It\u2019s a different form of being assaulted and taken advantage of.

Lesser (AP Images)\n\nI was perusing the internet streets like I always do looking for what\u2019s good in the hood when I came across an article from BuzzFeed that made me clutch my pearls, then touch my chest and say, \u201cWhy, I never!\u201d The headline? \u201cWe Found the Girl Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song and Sis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nThe article, penned by BuzzFeed staff writer Essence Gant, is one of those joints that I assume was written by somebody young(er)\u2014according to this the Life Currency interview, she\u2019s likely 31 now\u2014who maybe came across Living Single more recently and was excited and enthused about the lives of Khadijah, Max, Regine, Synclaire, Overton and Kyle and probably binged the show after it was made available on Hulu back in January.\n\nNothing about this is a bad thing. It is a great show and bingeworthy, and the theme music and the opening dance number are awesome. My guess is that the writer took a shining to the intro and was like, \u201cI wonder who that is. I\u2019m a writer; let me dig into the crates.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, those of us who grew up in the \u201990s, both on and with hip-hop, know and have always known that it was Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar in that dance number. Her silhouette was distinctive and we knew her from hosting Rap City, acting and choreographing videos for damn near everybody\u2014from Michael Jordan to Mary J. Blige. While I\u2019m not going to pretend that Big Lez was a mainstream household name, in the hip-hop world (a large part of the target demo for Living Single), we knew Big Lez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to me clutching my pearls and shit. When I read the headline that referred to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl,\u201d I felt like some unintentional shade was being thrown. I say unintentional because if you read the actual article (who does that?) you\u2019ll see that Ms. Gant thinks highly of Big Lez:\n\nAfter digging around the internet, we found out that the infamous choreographer is Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar, @yourgirllez on Instagram, and sis is #skingoals, #fitgoals, all the goals.\n\nShe\u2019s been a professional dancer and has worked with some of music\u2019s biggest legends. This video of her and Mary J. Blige is the cutest #blackgirlmagic nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s Big Lez, famed VJ who had some classic interviews and episodes of Rap City. She\u2019s a real basket of kittens and always has been. So again, I\u2019m sure Gant knows this and feels this and means no harm by referring to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl\u201d\u2014hell, the title ends with \u201cSis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nBut would it have been that much trouble to add her name to the title instead of making it seem like she was just some woman who danced in the intro and wasn\u2019t a somebody BEFORE she did that? We knew who she was. By \u201cwe,\u201d I mean hip-hop. In my view, calling her \u201cthe girl\u201d diminishes her star. It implies that most people\u2014or likely most people who read BuzzFeed\u2014wouldn\u2019t register her name enough to warrant mentioning it.\n\nEven still, \u201cWe Found Big Lez, Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song, and Sis Looks Good as Hell\u201d works just as well as the current title, no? I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to, and I wager many folks don\u2019t. But not even calling her by her name? That feels unnecessarily disrespectful. But maybe I\u2019m making a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe it\u2019s just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m gonna take it as disrespect, even if it\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m not going to turn it into a larger discussion about marginalizing black women; after all, the author of the \u201carticle\u201d is a black woman.\n\nAlso, you see how I put the word \u201carticle\u201d in quotes? Here\u2019s the situation: I\u2019m not sure if the source piece is actually an article\u2014the letters are huge, there are tons of hashtags, and it\u2019s largely GIFs and pictures.

From ThinkProgress:\n\nThe first five vendors combined offered just five romance novels, 14 religious texts, 24 drawing or coloring books, 21 puzzle books, 11 how-to books, one dictionary and one thesaurus. Last week, the state appeared to add a sixth vendor, but the full catalog doesn\u2019t appear to be available to people in prison in the state, and the governor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about the addition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there appear to be more-horrible restrictions on top of that.\n\nAccording to the document, people in prison may not receive packages containing fresh fruit or vegetables. Instead, they may only be provided with sugary, starchy or otherwise unhealthy snacks.\n\nThis, of course, comes at a cost to the families of people in prison. Items from the vendors are likely to come at a substantially higher cost than normal. Systems such as these are intentionally put in place to bilk the families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I will say it again here: Our criminal-justice system functions as a government fundraiser. The government is getting a piece off of the people forced to do time in that system any and every way it can.\n\nIt\u2019s a travesty.\n\nWorth noting: There is an organization that has been sending books to incarcerated people in 40 states at no charge for the last 20 years. Something like what NY DOCCS is doing now would make what Books Through Bars does impossible. Because the group is not on the approved list of vendors, people in prison and their families would not be able to choose a book on any topic and have it sent to them for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is evidence to show that having access to books can help improve the time people spend in prison and better equip them for when they come out.\n\nWhat NY DOCCs is doing shows it is not in the business of rehabilitation. More likely it is there to profit off of imprisonment and recidivism.\n\nRead more at ThinkProgress.", "keywords": ["prison", "department", "vendors", "corrections", "list", "books", "severe", "puts", "ny", "restrictions", "york", "prisoners", "doccs", "thinkprogress", "receive", "system", "state", "likely"], "polarity": 0.1584280303030303, "subjectivity": 0.5097774621212121},

This poses a problem when senior-level staff with full clearance have to be careful about what information they share with those who have only interim clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of November, more than 130 White House staffers were working without full security clearance.\n\nLast month we also learned that both Porter and White House speechwriter David Sorensen had histories of domestic abuse. This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets. Foreign intelligence services look for vulnerabilities in individuals with access to our most sensitive information. Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests. It\u2019s unusual that so many have taken so long.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House is tight-lipped about both the security-clearance process and which members of the White House staff and administration do not have full clearance.\n\nStill, we have to question the implications for our national security when even the president himself would not have security clearance if it didn\u2019t automatically come with the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also would not pass a full background check. There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to. We\u2019ve seen from his frequent outbursts on Twitter that he lacks self-control and decorum.\n\nThe sloppiness with which this security-clearance issue has been handled is deplorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was given access to top-secret information while working with interim status.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman was also working there without security clearance. She had no security clearance because she never applied for it.\n\nWe should be afraid.

Since stepping into the public eye in a 1976 Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s commercial, and her sitcom debut on the short-lived Baby, I\u2019m Back in 1978, Fields has built a career grounded in her deep love for her craft.\n\nHer most celebrated television roles are as Dorothy \u201cTootie\u201d Ramsey on NBC\u2019s The Facts of Life (1979-1988) and Regine Hunter on Fox\u2019s Living Single (1993-1998).\n\n\n\n\u201cI still love what I first fell in love with, which is creating characters, great storytelling, compelling stories,\u201d Fields says of her passion for acting. \u201cI\u2019m so excited that I still have the fire in my belly for it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn her new memoir, Blessed Life: My Surprising Journey of Joy, Tears, and Tales From Harlem to Hollywood, Fields, 48, opens up about the highs and lows in her life and career. Reflecting on her longevity and growth in the industry, including her avoidance of the \u201cchild-star curse,\u201d the New York native and mother of two wanted to bring light to the woman behind the beloved characters of her fans\u2019 childhood.\n\n\u201cAt this point, celebrating 40 years in the industry, it felt very much like a milestone. Not at all that I\u2019m ready to be done, but just a \u2018Let\u2019s look back on some things, and let\u2019s talk about some things that we haven\u2019t talked about.\u2019 So, it felt like a time to look at God\u2019s highlight reel when it comes to me,\u201d Fields says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn her moments of self-discovery while writing the book, she adds: \u201cWhat did I learn? Sometimes when you look back over a long stretch of your life, you look to see are there any patterns, are there any things I want to do better for the next set of decades? Different experiences taught me that I\u2019m far more resilient when I look back in hindsight. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m strong, but God\u2019s strength in me and his power in me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs the daughter of actress and television director Chip Fields (who played the abusive mother Penny Gordon on Good Times), Fields credits her mother\u2019s advice as one of her sources of direction. Whether encouraging or simply straightforward (\u201cHave a backup plan. You might not always be a cute kid that can do one-liners\u201d), she took her mother\u2019s words to heart during her hiatus to attend Pepperdine University as a teen before venturing back to acting in the early 1990s.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is, I made sure that I learned my craft because I didn\u2019t want to be a has-been at 17. A gem of wisdom I share in the book, and my mom shared with me at my first audition. I was very intimidated. I was at an audition for Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s syrup and I didn\u2019t think I belonged there,\u201d she recalls. \u201cJanet Jackson was there and I just felt like, \u2018Oh my God. What am I doing here?\u2019 Mom took me to the bathroom and she said, \u2018Never let anything or anyone intimidate you, even yourself.\u2019 I use that to this very day.\u201d\n\n\n\nFields has stepped behind the camera, directing and producing television shows and movies, even appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and Dancing With the Stars. Currently, she has a development deal for a TV movie drama with Lifetime network, has created a line of coffee with her husband, Christopher Morgan, and will be starring in the second season of the British comedy Living the Dream.\n\n\n\nThe Root talked to Fields about Living Single, her career ambitions and more.\n\n\n\nOn seeing the impact her career has had on fans:\n\nI had one person on social media who told me that they learned so much about themselves reading this book. I think one of the biggest compliments though is people who know me have said, \u201cI thought I knew you,\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know this about you,\u201d or \u201cI still learn something about you\u201d\u2014and my manager who\u2019s known me for decades says that. Those are the touching things when people have told me that because of my transparency in dealing with really difficult and challenging times in my life that they have connected or reconnected in a different way, spiritually, in their faith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how she learned to get out of her own way:\n\nThere are times we try to act like, oh, we\u2019re in our 30s and 40s and we\u2019ve conquered insecurity, or we\u2019re comfortable in our skin. That\u2019s a crock. You might have that an hour a month, and the rest of the time, you\u2019re actually working on that along with everything else. Whenever I have a big meeting, a red carpet, and I\u2019m feeling a little insecure and not as confident and as comfortable in my own skin, I remember my mom saying, \u201cDon\u2019t let anything or anyone intimidate you, including yourself.\u201d Most of the time it\u2019s not from external forces, it\u2019s an energy that we\u2019re putting in ourselves that generates from us. We get in our own head, we get in our own way and then got the nerve to put it on other people. No, that\u2019s you, boo-boo.\n\nOn what she aspires to do next in her career:\n\nThere are tons of characters that are still inside of me that I haven\u2019t done. There are tons of scripts and stories to tell, both as a director and an actor. For me, it just becomes, \u201cWhat haven\u2019t I done?\u201d It\u2019s still a long list; even though I\u2019ve been blessed to be in the industry for a long time, many of those years were playing one character. My two series, that\u2019s 14 years of comedy, so, being able to do drama is wonderful, like A Question of Faith. I would love to do sci-fi, I would love to do graphic novels, do more voice-overs, all sorts of things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the impact of Living Single nearly 25 years later:\n\nIt\u2019s very surreal and an indescribable blessing. The chemistry that we had and the relationship that we had, and it\u2019s still intact to this very day. We have a text thread between just the six of us. It\u2019s just like we still work together. Then when Hulu announced that they were going to be streaming the show, the response to that! I thought they were going to break social media. I was so blown away. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always saying to the fans, \u201cI love how you love us.\u201d It feels fantastic.\n\nOn her favorite episode and guest star:\n\nOne of my favorite guest stars was Grant Hill. He was so hilarious. It was so unexpected with his humor. My finale is definitely one of my favorites: the proposal [from Dexter].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn her thoughts about where Regine could be in a possible Living Single reboot:\n\nYou know, I have none! [Laughter.] I have no idea, and only because [Living Single creator] Yvette Lee Bowser is so brilliant. I wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to put into the universe where Regine would be and who she would be. I know she\u2019s somewhere being fabulous. That much we all know; that\u2019s part a no-brainer. Even if she\u2019s completely unfabulous and her world is falling apart, in her mind, she\u2019s still fabulous.", "keywords": ["memoir", "living", "im", "facts", "thats", "fields", "look", "love", "know", "celebrates", "career", "40year", "single", "kim", "life"], "polarity": 0.2327648102648102, "subjectivity": 0.4888535288535289},

Inmates held at GMDC will be transferred elsewhere over the upcoming months. Despite the closure, no guards will be laid off, but overtime hours are expected to drop.\n\nBrandon J.

Much more work remains, and we will not stop advocating and agitating until we #CLOSErikers for good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the report notes, the overall closure of the jails on Rikers was made possible by an overall drop in the city\u2019s jail population, which is now well below levels not seen since 1982. As of Jan. 1, 8,705 inmates were being held in the city\u2019s jails.\n\nAs the New York Post notes, de Blasio noted that the jail population will need to drop to 5,000 before the city can remove all detainees from Rikers and relocate them to community-based facilities in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. Those community-based facilities can currently house only 2,300 detainees, so the city has also started to locate and construct new jails.\n\nRead more at AM New York and the New York Post.", "keywords": ["city", "island", "mayor", "summer", "steps", "jail", "1st", "close", "rikers", "york", "post", "citys", "closure", "shut", "population"], "polarity": 0.08863636363636362, "subjectivity": 0.3852693602693603},

Why do I have to go? Why? For what?\u201d This was Nunberg\u2019s position on a subpoena. May we all be this bold some day.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.\u201d Yep, Nunberg just dropped this little jewel in the middle of his rant, because just like his idol Kanye, in between the nonsensical shit are bits of truth telling.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump caused this because he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Nunberg said, referring to the Russia investigation, Business Insider reports. \u201cHe decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey, and then he decided to have Russians in the Oval Office. You\u2019ll have to explain to me because I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d\n\n\n\nArguably the best line: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get sent to prison!\u201d Umm, I don\u2019t know how right you are about this one, Nunberg, but I like your moxie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNunberg was so off the rails that CNN anchor Erin Burnett asked him if he\u2019d been drinking.\n\nBurnett asked him if he\u2019d had anything else, you know, besides alcohol.

Lesser (AP Images)\n\nI was perusing the internet streets like I always do looking for what\u2019s good in the hood when I came across an article from BuzzFeed that made me clutch my pearls, then touch my chest and say, \u201cWhy, I never!\u201d The headline? \u201cWe Found the Girl Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song and Sis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nThe article, penned by BuzzFeed staff writer Essence Gant, is one of those joints that I assume was written by somebody young(er)\u2014according to this the Life Currency interview, she\u2019s likely 31 now\u2014who maybe came across Living Single more recently and was excited and enthused about the lives of Khadijah, Max, Regine, Synclaire, Overton and Kyle and probably binged the show after it was made available on Hulu back in January.\n\nNothing about this is a bad thing. It is a great show and bingeworthy, and the theme music and the opening dance number are awesome. My guess is that the writer took a shining to the intro and was like, \u201cI wonder who that is. I\u2019m a writer; let me dig into the crates.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, those of us who grew up in the \u201990s, both on and with hip-hop, know and have always known that it was Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar in that dance number. Her silhouette was distinctive and we knew her from hosting Rap City, acting and choreographing videos for damn near everybody\u2014from Michael Jordan to Mary J. Blige. While I\u2019m not going to pretend that Big Lez was a mainstream household name, in the hip-hop world (a large part of the target demo for Living Single), we knew Big Lez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to me clutching my pearls and shit. When I read the headline that referred to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl,\u201d I felt like some unintentional shade was being thrown. I say unintentional because if you read the actual article (who does that?) you\u2019ll see that Ms. Gant thinks highly of Big Lez:\n\nAfter digging around the internet, we found out that the infamous choreographer is Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar, @yourgirllez on Instagram, and sis is #skingoals, #fitgoals, all the goals.\n\nShe\u2019s been a professional dancer and has worked with some of music\u2019s biggest legends. This video of her and Mary J. Blige is the cutest #blackgirlmagic nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s Big Lez, famed VJ who had some classic interviews and episodes of Rap City. She\u2019s a real basket of kittens and always has been. So again, I\u2019m sure Gant knows this and feels this and means no harm by referring to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl\u201d\u2014hell, the title ends with \u201cSis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nBut would it have been that much trouble to add her name to the title instead of making it seem like she was just some woman who danced in the intro and wasn\u2019t a somebody BEFORE she did that? We knew who she was. By \u201cwe,\u201d I mean hip-hop. In my view, calling her \u201cthe girl\u201d diminishes her star. It implies that most people\u2014or likely most people who read BuzzFeed\u2014wouldn\u2019t register her name enough to warrant mentioning it.\n\nEven still, \u201cWe Found Big Lez, Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song, and Sis Looks Good as Hell\u201d works just as well as the current title, no? I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to, and I wager many folks don\u2019t. But not even calling her by her name? That feels unnecessarily disrespectful. But maybe I\u2019m making a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe it\u2019s just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m gonna take it as disrespect, even if it\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m not going to turn it into a larger discussion about marginalizing black women; after all, the author of the \u201carticle\u201d is a black woman.\n\nAlso, you see how I put the word \u201carticle\u201d in quotes? Here\u2019s the situation: I\u2019m not sure if the source piece is actually an article\u2014the letters are huge, there are tons of hashtags, and it\u2019s largely GIFs and pictures. Hell, it\u2019s basically a list of pictures with lots of captions. But it\u2019s a byline, so it\u2019s an article, right? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to not call it one\u2014get your money, girl\u2014but me adding those quotes makes it seem like I\u2019m mocking or belittling, basically being disrespectful. But I don\u2019t mean it that way.\n\nAnyway, is it me? Am I tripping? Or does the headline seem mad disrespectful, even if unintentionally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInquiring minds would like to know.", "keywords": ["dont", "living", "writer", "im", "article", "know", "headline", "good", "lez", "sis", "mad", "buzzfeeds", "disrespectful", "big"], "polarity": 0.10394088669950739, "subjectivity": 0.44401340996168576},

I have loved this show ever since it was a part of Fox\u2019s old black-night trifecta alongside Martin and New York Undercover. Insert a moment of silence for Eddie Torres here.\n\n\n\nWhile I hold all these shows near and dear, you notice things about them upon viewing them as an adult. When it comes to Living Single specifically, while I missed a few things, I\u2019m noticing in hindsight that what I loved most about this show was captured in its first and second seasons. Those two seasons were like the television equivalent of all of the 1990s black romantic comedies that I loved. And then there were the next two seasons, which were fine but not as strong as the first two.\n\nI can live with that and still enjoy them\u2014well, the third more than the fourth, but I don\u2019t want to piss off Alderwoman Maxine Shaw. Having said that, while many of us have been talking about the best of Living Single, little has been said about the final season. That\u2019s probably for good reason: It was strange and, in some cases, quite terrible.\n\n\n\nAgain, I love Living Single, but by the fifth season, it was like the show ran out of gas and then exploded in a Taco Bell parking lot.\n\nThe final season was also its shortest, and to God be the glory for that because fans had suffered enough by then. In the first episode we meet Tripp, who seemed nice and all, but it\u2019s the fifth season: We don\u2019t want to meet any new damn people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second episode, Kyle Barker flees for London. You know, I didn\u2019t really love hearing Kyle Barker sing all that much, but he was way too integral to the show to just up and go. For the record, I still blame Maxine for running his ass away. Yes, she was a groundbreaking character and a pioneer in gluttony, but it was her fault.\n\nIn the third episode, we start repeating storylines, e.g., Khadijah James dating another basketball player. But, like, didn\u2019t she already goof up with Grant Hill in the second season? How does she still not know how to date a baller? It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t learn until that movie with Common. Yeah, I know they had different names and lives concocted, but y\u2019all know that character in Just Wright was just Khadijah with a second career after the media bubble of the 2000s and the recession. I assume by then, Flavor magazine went under and she went back to school.\n\nLater, we get episodes that center on Overton, Tripp and Russell. Russell is amusing if you\u2019re into sexual harassment and Jamaican accents that are a D-plus at best, but we never cared that much about him, did we? No. The answer is no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Tripp, well, I already told y\u2019all my stance on him was, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d Speaking of new people, back then, I was happy that former MTV VJ Idalis DeLe\u00f3n found some acting work, but I didn\u2019t care about her, either, and the show never gave me that great a reason.\n\nThen there were episodes like \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d where Synclaire disguises herself as a man. You know, this show fell into those goofy tricks 1990s sitcoms used to employ to keep the machine going and pay their mortgage, but I truly wish they found something more to do with Kim Coles\u2019 talent.\n\n\n\nAs for the other Kim, the legendary Kim Fields (we will ignore her time on The Real Housewives of Atlanta), she didn\u2019t even make it to the damn finale. She finally gets a rich man and is so damn happy about it that she can\u2019t tell our black asses goodbye? Maybe she knew the last few episodes were only going to get worse, and since she was the high-saditty character, she couldn\u2019t keep suffering like this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t deserve to suffer, though, \u2019cause that finale was the fool. We do get Kyle Barker back\u2014but by way of a story that involves him being the anonymous sperm donor Maxine picked out? Really?! We\u2019re going to end on \u201cBig Wave Barker\u201d?\n\nDid everyone just give up by then?\n\nOf all the times those two have had sex, it was the field trip to the sperm clinic that miraculously made these two parents? And isn\u2019t she a lawyer? Wouldn\u2019t she know he would have no legal rights, so if she was that over him, she could keep on pushing? Oh, wait, I\u2019m supposed to find all of this romantic. As if it\u2019s some kind of spin on Look Who\u2019s Talking.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least Scooter\u2019s difficult ass showed up for Khadijah at the very last minute, but for all the love we declare about this show and the talk of a potential reboot, when I think about this final season, I am reminded of how bad it was and how much would have to fundamentally change in order for this show to be watchable in this century.\n\nIt can\u2019t be as silly as the show became with time. Where will they all be living? Will Queen Latifah be running a digital site and bitter because reporting is expensive and opinion pieces are paying the brownstone she refuses to sell to the colonizers? Is Maxine Shaw a TV judge in Atlanta but moves back to New York? What is Synclaire doing? Tell me we don\u2019t have to pretend Tripp ever existed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying a reboot is impossible, but some shows are easier tweaked than others. There\u2019s Will & Grace and then there\u2019s a bunch of other newly announced reboots that I know I will not be interested in watching. I was rooting for a Living Single reboot until I revisited how it ended.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease do not be mad at me for anything I\u2019ve written, Queen Latifah and blacks. Please don\u2019t get me out of Wakanda for the thoughts and concerns expressed here. It\u2019s just that we have to be honest about how this show ended if it is to be reborn.

But just in case you needed solid evidence to cite in your next argument with your racist aunty, a new study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission is here to help.\n\nThe commission\u2019s analysis of data, ranging from 2012 to 2016, shows that black offenders continued to receive, on average, sentences that were 19.1 percent longer than those of white offenders who committed the same crime.\n\nThis disparity in sentencing remained the same even when violence and the offender\u2019s criminal history were taken into consideration. Among the study\u2019s key findings: \u201cViolence in an offender\u2019s criminal history does not appear to contribute to the sentence imposed to any extent beyond its contribution to the offender\u2019s criminal history score determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d\n\nEven taking into consideration a violent past, black men were still slapped with sentences that were on average 20.4 percent longer than those of their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study also notes that the disparity between sentencing lies heavily on \u201cnon-government sponsored department of variances\u201d\u2014i.e., basically, the discretion of judges.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nJudges are less likely to voluntarily revise sentences downward for black offenders than for white ones, in other words. And even when judges do reduce black offenders\u2019 sentences, they do so by smaller amounts than for white offenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is currently a well-known and accepted fact that the United States has the largest prison population in the world. In 2015 the Sentencing Project noted that roughly 2.2 million people were currently incarcerated in the nation\u2019s prisons and jails, marking a 500 percent increase in incarceration over the past 40 years.\n\nBlack men, the nonprofit found, were nearly six times as likely to be incarcerated as their white counterparts.\n\nNow we can prove once again that not only are black men more likely to be imprisoned\u2014they\u2019re also likely to sit behind bars for a far longer time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["prison", "sentencing", "sentences", "likely", "black", "white", "shows", "study", "longer", "water", "serve", "criminal", "history", "wet", "offenders", "men"], "polarity": -0.0787384716732543, "subjectivity": 0.4272727272727273},

It\u2019s really more of a cackle. Over the phone, her effusiveness travels, just as her character Maxine Shaw\u2019s did through five seasons of Living Single, the prototypical \u201990s sitcom about four black women in Brooklyn. At one point a cultural force\u2014the highest-rated television show among black audiences\u2014the series has had a recent resurgence via streaming on Hulu, where its stories have aged gracefully.\n\nAlexander has since reappeared on shows like Queen Sugar and Bosch, and memorably, a bit role in Get Out. She also makes a living as a writer. Five years ago, she wrote a spec script for Mad Men and posted it on her blog, where she explained, in a post titled \u201cWhy I Wrote a Mad Men Episode With Negroes\u201d: \u201cI was born in the mountains of Arizona, but as a writer I don\u2019t have a hard time imagining black and white on Madison Avenue.\u201d Most recently, she wrote a sci-fi graphic novel titled Concrete Park. And on February 28, the first issue of her Buffy the Vampire Slayer comic book spinoff Giles, will be released as part of a four-issue miniseries, co-written with Buffy creator Joss Whedon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, she and I talked about her foray into comics. We praised Black Panther and went deep into the legend of Maxine and Living Single (and how T.C. Carson, as Kyle Barker, was like the Dean Martin to her Jerry Lewis). She also got passionate about her work as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, being non-religious, and Brooklyn gentrification. Our lightly edited conversation below.\n\nJEZEBEL: Thank you so much for speaking with me. It\u2019s an honor.\n\n\n\nERIKA ALEXANDER: Girl, please. Thank you.\n\nI first have to ask if you\u2019ve seen Black Panther yet because it\u2019s the biggest phenomenon right now, and because you\u2019re into comics, and because your Get Out co-star Daniel Kaluuya is in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is yes, yes and yes. I have seen it, and I loved it.\n\nHad you read the comics before or did you go into it dry?\n\nI certainly hadn\u2019t read the comics, but you\u2019re talking about 50 years of back-reading. It wasn\u2019t gonna happen [laughs]. Not with me. But I had some awareness of it because my ex-husband Tony Puryear was friends with [producer] Reginald Hudlin and all those people. I truly was surprised by what they did on the screen. I was glad to see they stayed true to the nature of [the story] by embracing the flaw in the man [T\u2019Challa] and giving him a really great bad guy, frankly, who stood for every American and lost child of Africa, who stood in for that, and that anger and that rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Killmonger character.\n\nKillmonger, yes. Michael B. Jordan did a really lovely job. And wasn\u2019t he delicious? With all his muscles? And scars.\n\nYes, half the joy of watching the movie was just looking at him. Everyone in it looked gorgeous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh my god. And as a dark-skinned person, it was very satisfying to see all the dark skin, even at the end, when they ended on the little black boy\u2019s face, the dark-skinned brother\u2019s face. They were choosing to say this is unapologetically black. That the love interest can\u2019t be light-skinned and everybody else be dark, like they always do. Those were all great choices. I mean, did you see that and feel that as you were watching?\n\nYeah, definitely, as a dark-skinned woman, I was excited beforehand that the cast featured Lupita and Danai Gurira. It exceeded my expectations as far as the storyline and depth of the plot.\n\nAnd you know Danai writes, right? I\u2019ve seen her play The Convert.\n\nAnd Eclipsed.\n\nI saw The Convert at the Kirk Douglas [Theatre] before Eclipsed. That girl is no joke. To me, she\u2019s getting to startle people about her range. They love her now, but they\u2019re gonna be, I think, astounded by her soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople don\u2019t know that you double as a writer as well. Joss Whedon reached out to you to co-write this graphic novel series based on Buffy but centered around Giles. Can you give me a breakdown of the story and some of the themes you explored?\n\nGiles is\u2014Did you see Buffy the Vampire Slayer?\n\nYeah, I loved it growing up.\n\nOkay, well, I was a person who did not. [Laughs] So if I make mistakes, it\u2019s honest mistakes because we\u2019re doing a totally different thing. I was working. I\u2019ve been head of my household for a very, very long time and frankly when you do TV, you barely watch it. So when [Joss] called me and said, \u201cDo you wanna do it?\u201d I said yes! But then I was like, \u201cOh my god, what is it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Laughs]\n\nI was gratified when he said it\u2019s gonna be Giles the Watcher\u2014who teaches Buffy\u2014now resurrected into a teenage body. There\u2019s a whole mythology in the comic books. He\u2019s gotta go into hiding in an inner-city high school where he meets a black girl vampire who\u2019s 200 years old. Now when [Joss] said \u201cblack girl vampire, 200 years old,\u201d that\u2019s when I was like, I\u2019ll do it! [Laughs] I was gonna do it anyway because it\u2019s Joss Whedon. But I was like, now I see why maybe I\u2019m necessary. Not that I wouldn\u2019t have been necessary before, but I saw that I could put my experiences in it.\n\nAnybody who\u2019s a black girl vampire in America, the people that she mistrusts are humans. They\u2019re the monsters. She\u2019s not the monster to herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wanted to not only talk about, here\u2019s this Watcher that teaches this slayer how to fight for justice, but this vampire who\u2019s seen as his mortal enemy will be teaching him a history about what it is to be human in a whole other way. And I like the vampire, Roux, because Roux\u2019s whole thing is\u2014 I mean anybody who\u2019s a black girl vampire in America, the people that she mistrusts are humans. They\u2019re the monsters. She\u2019s not the monster to herself. So she\u2019s always asking [Giles], \u201cSome monster hunter. Why aren\u2019t you hunting them?\u201d And I love that.\n\n\n\nWhen you say inner city, do you mean black?\n\n\n\nWell, I hate to use that term inner city, but it\u2019s a good way for you to understand that it\u2019s a high school that Giles would never be in. I don\u2019t wanna say inner city. He\u2019s in a city high school, and it\u2019s everything that means. It\u2019s actually a charter school, an academy. I tried to mitigate some of that by making sure they understood there weren\u2019t only black people there. It was just someplace that wasn\u2019t going to be as organized as Sunnydale\u2014\u2019cause [Giles] was brought up in a boarding school in England\u2014for him to bump up against and have conflict with something that he didn\u2019t know anything about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was the most exciting part of the story to develop?\n\nWell, I had to remember through this whole thing, the hero is Giles. After I said, \u201cOh, I know how to write this! Somebody about to get his ass whooped!\u201d [Laughs] And then I realized, no not him. He\u2019s the hero, he\u2019s gonna learn something. He\u2019s gonna get a little ass-kicking, but he\u2019s also gotta do some ass-kicking. It really makes you think about the pathologies that guide us, that are given to us, and what you adopt. You got the hurt and pain of slavery, you got the hurt and pain of poverty, and all these things sort of pressing down on you. And then you got the things you take in that we create around, the anger and rage. To me, the fun part of writing that was asking myself the same questions in a new way and making sure that I service the hero, Giles. For a writer as new as me, that was a little difficult, but I tried my best.\n\nIs there a theme that runs throughout your writing?\n\nThe thing that pops up, now that I\u2019ve written enough, is home. Both my parents were orphans. My father was an itinerant preacher and my mother was a teacher. I used to be obsessed with buying my mother a home. A place we could all be. The hurt and the pain that was there could not be assuaged by anything bought. It had to be something that you can\u2019t buy, that peace. And that was a learning curve. So I think that home keeps popping up. By the way, none of my characters will ever be heroic in that classic way because, like I said, I had an itinerant preacher father. And I loved my father, but he was so damaged. He would tell people what to do and the hypocrisy...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI used to look up to him. You grow up and you go, why are you not doing anything like that? You sitting up here telling stories. And after awhile, you see that everywhere. And people say, you\u2019re not religious? Absolutely not. I\u2019m reformed. I don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s a panacea. I believe people do what they can to get where they need to go, and maybe I didn\u2019t need that much [religion]. I am a spiritual person, that\u2019s how I was raised. But I can let it go in a way that other people can\u2019t. I was always afraid and thinking God\u2019s gonna throw me in hell. I said, I can\u2019t do that. If he\u2019s gonna throw people in hell, he ain\u2019t gonna throw me. I\u2019m sorry. Home [is a theme], but also false identify, false faces, two faces.\n\n\n\nWhat made your dad a hypocrite?\n\nHe was damaged, because he was an abused child. As a pastor, he would advise people on what they should do, but would often do the opposite. Growing up, I looked up to him, but that contradiction was confusing. I soon came to view him as a hypocrite. At the end of his life, while he was fighting for his life, he never apologized or righted wrongs he could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m curious what he thought of you falling out of religion.\n\nOh, he didn\u2019t think nothing \u2019cause he was dead. He died. But he knew who he was, too. He was aware. His family had fallen apart. He was running a church in East New York and had only six members. And he was dying from congestive heart failure and diabetes. He was fighting for his life, and even inside of all that, never righted the wrongs, never said he was sorry and never accepted it. It\u2019s a shame because he was ordained at the age of six, and they said he was truly a talented healer. I saw him in his prime and then, growing up, I saw him in his decline.\n\nDid you get to buy your mom a home like you wanted to?\n\nI did buy her a home and then when the 2008 crash happened, actually three years before, I lost it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Arizona?\n\nSouth Carolina. By that time, we moved. We were in Arizona and then we moved\u2014\u2019cause he was an itinerant preacher\u2014to upstate New York and then to a seminary in Philadelphia and that\u2019s where I was discovered in a Merchant Ivory [Productions] film called My Little Girl. Then to New York, where they gave him the church. My mother moved to South Carolina after he passed away. And now she lives in upstate New York. She just goes anywhere \u2019cause they were both orphans.\n\nYou talk about not being religious. We don\u2019t see many stories in Hollywood about black people who aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2019Cause we had to be. That\u2019s slavery. You were beat. If somebody tells you this is it and you\u2019re gonna get something in heaven, you\u2019d believe that, too. I\u2019d believe a fairytale. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s just a fairytale. I\u2019m saying you can believe anything somebody told you when you\u2019re in the depths of hell. Malcolm talked about how we wouldn\u2019t have this religion without our oppressors giving it to us so we could be good negroes\u2014good niggas\u2014and work in the field. I believe it takes a certain amount of bravery and courage to throw off some of the things your parents gave you, especially if it\u2019s out of fear. I grew up in the mountains of Arizona, that Southern gothic stuff. It was: hell, damnation, you gon\u2019 die, you better do it, the wages of sin is death. I was full of anxiety, panic, any little thing I did, I\u2019d be like, please! It was too much. [Laughs] I had to let it go. I decided if I\u2019m going to hell, we all going. I really did. \u2019Cause I was a good person and I knew it.\n\nI want to go into the past a bit because there\u2019s been renewed conversation around Living Single now that the episodes are available on Hulu. People who don\u2019t know your backstory may be curious how you landed on the show, how you got that iconic role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, I\u2019d done The Cosby Show, but by that time, I\u2019d been in showbiz almost seven years. I went for an audition and didn\u2019t really think much of it because I was trying to be on a show called M.A.N.T.I.S., which was on Fox. It was a comic book series. And by the way, I\u2019m not the biggest nerd in the world. It seems like I am, but I\u2019m not.\n\nIt seems to be a theme.\n\nNot at all, it\u2019s just the character I was going for was a scientist. I was like, I\u2019m gonna be that scientist! [Laughs] I didn\u2019t know M.A.N.T.I.S. from nothing. I didn\u2019t get the role and I ended up getting Living Single. I did admire [Queen] Latifah and I heard she was in it, but I didn\u2019t really know what that would mean. The [Maxine Shaw] character, I was told later, was not supposed to be a regular. She was supposed to come in every now and then. So I did the pilot and I think from the beginning, you could tell how much the audience was enjoying it, how much they were laughing, how well the chemistry was. That was automatic. At that time, having never done a comedy series from the ground up, I didn\u2019t know that was gonna be automatic. I was like I gotta get back to New York and do some more theater. And they were like, no we picked it up, and we\u2019re off to the races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back, what do you realize was so special about the show in terms of its significance in pop culture? I\u2019m sure at the time you weren\u2019t thinking about all that.\n\nI think we always had a lot of love from the audience, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to pay attention to it. They were looking because we were right behind Martin and also A Different World. I gotta give props to the people who paved the way, not just The Cosby Show, but Different World had tons of really strong women who were in school but they didn\u2019t have careers yet. I always said, I kinda knew what it was gonna be \u2019cause I thought Whitley and those people would [eventually] be where we were [on Living Single]. I think that you know right away whether something\u2019s working with comedy. You may not know with drama, but you know with comedy. Something may be making you cry at home, but it doesn\u2019t touch everybody that way. But comedy is instant. You almost can\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s like a sneeze. And you\u2019re either laughing or you aren\u2019t. And they were always laughing. Always. We were laughing at ourselves. In fact, we didn\u2019t need the audience. We laughed at our own jokes and our own ridiculousness.\n\nCOMEDY IS INSTANT. YOU ALMOST CAN\u2019T STOP IT. IT\u2019S LIKE A SNEEZE. AND YOU\u2019RE EITHER LAUGHING OR YOU AREN\u2019T. AND THEY WERE ALWAYS LAUGHING.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a very beautiful set in terms of the generosity. There was no competition, just always astounded by what we thought was pure genius. You know, the silliness of it all. And yet we were very accessible and down-to-earth in real life. We really were. Everybody that came on our show as guests said, \u201cThis is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d We were so happy because we didn\u2019t have all the big sort of catering that Friends had and the marketing that other shows had. But we did have the fact that we tried to make people feel like they were wanted, that they were necessary, and that we admired them. We had a lot of people who came on who were admirable. Gladys Knight, we had Shaft. We had everybody. Jasmine Guy, Charnele Brown. C.C.H. Pounder. Harold Perrineau. Eartha Kitt. [Ed. Note: Nia Long! TLC! Grant Hill! Naughty by Nature!] Come on now. These are the people, literally they\u2019d come in and we\u2019d bow down to them. Genuflect. And they\u2019d be like, stop, stop. We had the fellas who always would bring them food and say, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Everything was really easygoing, and nobody was there to laugh at you. Nobody thought that they were above it all. We had our issues, but that wasn\u2019t one of them. So I think early on, we knew we had something just because of the chemistry of the set and generosity of spirit.\n\nWhat were the issues you had?\n\nWell, you have issues because we\u2019re six very independently outspoken personalities. I\u2019m telling you, if something happened, you would hear about it. It was really one of those things where we so respected each other that we rarely ever fought between us. When we did, it was about the same silly stuff you might fight about in high school. [Laughs] Just some crap. But really, I\u2019d look at other sets and go, I can\u2019t even really believe they\u2019re dealing with stuff like this \u2019cause we had a Shangri-La. Again, any problems that came on that set [were] from us not doing our jobs as well as we could have and then being pulled up like, okay let\u2019s get it done. But for the most part, we really did work hard. All the time. And come in prepared. There\u2019s times where it could be frustrating after five years. Whatever problems you had after four years in high school, we had the same ones. Sometimes you just want to break out. But they were, to me, nothing compared to [other shows].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine\u2019s character was especially groundbreaking, a black woman lawyer who would qualify as what many people today call unapologetic. I was looking back on old Jet stories about Living Single and a term that was used a lot was \u201cupwardly mobile.\u201d That was a big thing about the show, that it was these black characters who had jobs. What did you think about your character as you were playing her and what do you think of Maxine now?\n\nWhen you first see scripts, they\u2019re lines on a piece of paper. To me, it\u2019s not a character at all. It can be attitude inside of the lines. Cues for you. But you don\u2019t know yet what you don\u2019t know. I was actually doing my best version of my older sister who\u2019s looney as a bat. I\u2019m telling you, Carolyn is very much in Max\u2019s DNA. And only people who know Carolyn go, \u201cOh yes I can see that.\u201d I only graduated from high school. The lawyer I had seen on TV that would\u2019ve been most identifiable to me was Phylicia Rashad and I never thought I could be her. Claire Huxtable. And the person [Maxine] had her hairstyle biting off was Whoopi Goldberg. Because I was coming straight from New York, I just happened to have that hairstyle in my head. A woman from Red Salon had created these new locs and she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna put that in so you can grow your hair out,\u201d from another show I\u2019d just done in Jamaica.\n\nI went around the world, came back, and I asked Ms. Tyson\u2014she was in [The Salon]\u2014I said, I don\u2019t know what to do with my hair and I don\u2019t know what producers want. She said, Don\u2019t ever let anybody tell you what to do to your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I really didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be. All I knew was I needed to come through that door with energy. They put me in a red-hot suit I think, and it showed legs and I always had long legs. I never thought about what my body looked like. I\u2019m a tomboy. But for people to see a person in that suit, strutting around talking crap, they went crazy. But I was just being me because I grew up around men. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s child, but I\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl. I don\u2019t have no problem shit-talking. I talk so much crap in real life, but I\u2019m shyer than people know. I certainly never did as well as Max did as early. But I knew how to fake the funk. That\u2019s one thing black people know. I was shit-talking and I\u2019ll tell you, it worked. And I was glad they liked it. The rest is all costume, hair, then you get to the words that Yvette Lee [Bowser, the show\u2019s creator and executive producer] wrote.\n\nDid anyone ever ask you to change the hairstyle?\n\n\n\nThey would\u2019ve been wasting their time if they had! Because I had just run into Cicely Tyson, girl. I was in John Atchison\u2019s hair salon in New York and I was just dealing with my\u2014 I\u2019ve had fine hair that was long that grew out as I wore braids. I went around the world, came back, and I asked Ms. Tyson\u2014she was in [the salon]\u2014I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my hair and I don\u2019t know what producers want.\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever let anybody tell you what to do to your hair.\u201d And let me tell you something, when Cicely Tyson tells you what not to do, you remember it. It\u2019s like she put a hex on me. And from that day on, I never thought or cared. If they said something, that probably would\u2019ve been the end of the road for me \u2019cause I would\u2019ve been offended. The truth is I came in the door with that [hair], that\u2019s how we filmed it, and that\u2019s what it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storyline between Max and Kyle was really interesting because it was this love-hate relationship. Why do you think that couple resonated so strongly with people?\n\n\n\nThat happened organically. I think the producers saw that it was real gold when the audience came in. They liked it. But if you notice, in the beginning, I really sparred more with Regine. They would have those biting scenes between Max and Regine, but then Kyle would gang up with Regine and get me. And then they started to tilt it more toward me and Kyle. \u2019Cause it would be a good back-and-forth. And T.C. [Carson] was the first person I met. We auditioned, we were in the same hotel, and he was the first castmember I met, so we were already friends. And it turns out, we were born on the same day, November 19, in real life. So we were meant to be.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to find partners in life. Everybody has a partner in life, if you look at Gene Kelly, who he danced with, Fred Astaire. People have their comedy partners. Famous comedy partners. Jerry Lewis and Martin. [T.C.] was mine. And I stumbled into that relationship not knowing that that would be the case, and was really gratified. Because he couldn\u2019t have loved me more, and I loved him, too. We were good at going back and forth and the audience ate it up and, there you go, that\u2019s all you need. It\u2019s like you\u2019re speaking a language between three. We had us. But we would play off the audience. We needed them in order to build and for them to know about the back and forth, for them to have the expectation and start going, \u201cOhhh, Max getting ready to get\u2026\u201d You know? We needed that. What that brings is huge. You can\u2019t do that without them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you think of the recent slate of reboots like Will & Grace, Rosanne? Is it a good trend or should those shows be left in the past?\n\nI think it\u2019s great that audiences are nostalgic, but I haven\u2019t made any plans to reboot any show I was on, including Living Single.\n\nThere were stories out about how the idea for Friends was basically based on Living Single. Queen Latifah talked about it in an interview. And I read that Yvette cited Waiting to Exhale. She said the success of the book with black women helped Living Single get made. Do you know much about how the idea for the show came about? Had you talked to Yvette about it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I have to say I was more like a hired gun. The thing about me, I\u2019m like a horse with blinders. I\u2019ll just do what\u2019s in front of me sometimes. And it often doesn\u2019t matter where it comes from \u2019cause I\u2019m just like, let me just get in here and do my thang. I heard those things myself and I knew about the whole Friends thing. That did come around later on. John Henton tells a different story where we all knew that we were called My Girls at first and then eventually got to Living Single. One of the execs came down and was walking around with a list of names and one of them was Living Single and one of them was Friends. And they went with Living Single, but Friends was on that list as well. So that\u2019s true. And, you know, Latifah and Kim Coles, the show was built around them, so they have an origin story around their coming together that\u2019s totally different. I have to say I\u2019m kind of grateful \u2019cause I didn\u2019t know what it was gonna be, or if it was going to be. All I knew was that they had hired me to do a gig and I was hoping that, again, that I\u2019d be able to do it and get back to New York. I was happy that didn\u2019t happen, now that I look back.\n\nDo you have a great memory that you walked away with from that show? Obviously, there are a lot.\n\nThere are a lot. It\u2019s hard to say. A lot of people don\u2019t know that Michael Clarke Duncan was our security guard. We called him Bear. I remember Bear came in, he said, \u201cGirl, I got a role. I\u2019m gonna do this thing called Armageddon.\u201d We were like, \u201cReally, bear, what is that?\u201d [Laughs] He told us he was going to do some movie and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, we hope you got a nice part in it.\u201d He goes and does Armageddon, he comes back, and he tells us. We said, \u201cWe went to go see your movie, Bear, and you didn\u2019t get killed. You lasted till the end.\u201d Who knew he\u2019d be The Green Mile and all these other things. You see the sweetness of Bear, you know that\u2019s who was guarding our door, so you know that everyone was welcome. You see Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile, was guarding our door, then you know what kind of hospitality and fortune we were in at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a time where black people were magical and it went away.\n\nIt was a time where black people were magical and it went away. Literally, they segregated TV after the year 2000. They had a few shows, Bernie Mac and Chris Rock, but for the most part it went away until Shonda Rhimes proved, with her excellence, that we were profitable and worth betting on again. That\u2019s shocking. And we rode the end of that wave. I want to tell people, what they should know about the show is we were well aware of being fortunate, but we also thought we belonged, and it was because of all the people that we had seen, from Good Times on. We knew we were standing on the shoulders of those people and, frankly, it\u2019s everything in life to know that. I think it\u2019s like being in an HBCU, like Different World, where you\u2019re aware of your importance but you also know that you got a job to do, you got something to prove. We hope we proved it.\n\nNow there\u2019s a new generation of black creatives making shows like Insecure and Atlanta. The Chi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nHave you gotten to check out any of those shows? And why do you think there was such a decline before?\n\nI\u2019ve seen a couple of those shows and I really love Issa Rae. I really like all the shows. There was a decline because there\u2019s racism. That\u2019s out-and-out racism. It wasn\u2019t \u2019cause [the shows] weren\u2019t profitable. It wasn\u2019t \u2019cause they weren\u2019t making money. We don\u2019t think that exists until we see the ascendance of somebody that\u2019s really radical and extreme as who\u2019s in the White House now. But those forces always existed and they will tamp down excellence of color anywhere they can. Because they have a lie to tell and they can\u2019t tell that lie in the face of a moving image. A moving image is a dreamscape of the world. If you keep showing black people doing well, it\u2019s harder to do First 48, it\u2019s harder to do the cop show and all that other mess. You have to create a space of absence. And so the absence sucked [these shows] out the door. There were many [black] people who made plenty of money, but they weren\u2019t in a position to really make change. And I\u2019m talking about the Wayans Brothers, on. None of them owned a studio. There was no Netflix, there was no streaming, there was nothing, and you were lucky to do some independent films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes this new era of blackness on TV feel like a renaissance to you, having lived through that age in the \u201990s?\n\nNot to me. It feels like somebody finally\u2014The baton was coming over the mountain and through the woods and somebody finally threw it at us and we caught it. We said, this time we not giving it up. There might be some renaissance in the way we\u2019re approaching it. That the pathology is a lot less and that we\u2019re aware of the pathology. So maybe there is a renaissance in the expectation of how we\u2019re supposed to lay it out there. Awkward Black Girl couldn\u2019t get through, but she\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s like somebody threw her the baton from a long way and said, \u201cHere, bitch run!\u201d\n\n[Laughs]\n\n\u201cRun like you\u2019re on fire. And don\u2019t ever give it up.\u201d And guess what, Issa Rae ain\u2019t giving it up. Shonda Rhimes ain\u2019t giving it up. Guess what\u2019s not giving it up? These huge markets that they just realized need to be serviced. There are no more borders. They are now stopped by their awareness of people around them. And I say \u201cthey\u201d because it was a real \u201cthey.\u201d It was a real structure in place. But this time, with all these different YouTubes and everything else, people have their own channels. They have their own CNN. They get up each morning and be like, \u201cHi, this is Terrence Richards in South Carolina.\u201d They do their own reports, y\u2019all. [Laughs] And guess what, good bad or ugly, they\u2019re online. Nobody can keep telling lies in the face of a moving image. They can see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou brought up Trump and it kinda flew under the radar that you served as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nI was her most traveled surrogate. I was with her for nine years.\n\nThere was one campaign stop where you said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go backwards.\u201d What was your feeling on election night, knowing that was basically going to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUm. I ain\u2019t got the words. I\u2019m telling you, I ain\u2019t got the words. You wanna know the truth? I thought that there was something wrong. I always said that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t win. America lost. America lost that night. I knew something was wrong. People started to blame. I said, no I have been on this campaign the whole time for several years. I know what was done in Detroit. Sure people would say, \u201cWell she could\u2019ve done...\u201d But I know what was done. I was there. I was in those small places, the large places. She didn\u2019t run the race they said, and Russia really did matter more than people think. I keep saying, people need to look from precinct to precinct, from polling place to polling place. People think it has to be just tech. You can just pay people off. That sounds crazy and I\u2019ve never been a conspiracy theorist. This is not a conspiracy. Journalists need to go and follow that money. Something went wrong. That\u2019s what I felt.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did know. That Hillary Clinton was a stand-up chick. She would immediately concede if that was the case and that we would move on, because that\u2019s who she is, and she wouldn\u2019t contest it. And that broke my heart, because I wanted her to contest it. I wanted her to fight. But she was right. She\u2019d go, \u201cPeople think democracy is a spectator sport and it\u2019s not.\u201d And now they\u2019re seeing what\u2019s on the other end of their fork. So anybody who thought she was the lesser of two evils, shame on them. She was the best of what was good. And if they can\u2019t recognize decent and good people in front of them, then they deserve people like him up there. That\u2019s what they get. I get hot, but it made me mad because we could\u2019ve gone from one smooth move [to another]. We did it before after Bill Clinton, we could\u2019ve gone to Gore and kept moving with progress and we let some silliness in. But this was even more insidious. So good luck.\n\nAs far as the lesser of two evils, did you find yourself in conversations with women voters who were skeptical? How did you handle the skeptics?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, that\u2019s all I found for her. The funny thing is, people kept trying to qualify it with, \u201cI\u2019m gonna vote for her.\u201d I said, \u201cStop acting like this is the worst thing but you\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know what they didn\u2019t know. I would tell them things and say, \u201cGo to the website, goddammit!\u201d It\u2019s just ridiculous to be that ignorant in the age of Google. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she did that. Why didn\u2019t she say it?\u201d She did say that! She says it all the time. Are you listening? You\u2019re not. Because you want to believe a lie. And you can\u2019t tell people that are looking for a lie that they can\u2019t find one. You can find one for Obama. He\u2019s from Kenya, this, whatever, and people believe that mess.\n\nThere\u2019s only 13% of us. But can you imagine that we hold up this world that much? How brilliant are we?\n\nI said, let\u2019s get real. This person has been in your space, and I\u2019m talking about healthcare for children, all this stuff was in place, Pell Grants, changed adoption laws, handicap laws. And you don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind that? I said that\u2019s pathetic. And guess what? They let that fool up in there. America always wanna play like it\u2019s The Voice. Or American Idol. \u201cOh, he hit a bad note so that means he\u2019s not good.\u201d You know how many bad notes Prince or Michael Jackson might\u2019ve hit in a competition like that? Well, maybe not Michael. [Laughs] But you get the point, right? They hear the bad note and don\u2019t hear the song. If they can\u2019t hear the good melody and the lyrics, I say fuck \u2019em. I\u2019m angry still \u2019cause we didn\u2019t have to be in this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a lot of people are still angry and trying to direct that anger to be more active.\n\nYes, and I want black women to know, because we tried to hold up the world, because we always trying to hold up the world, that I appreciate that. They need to hold their head up. They knew who she was for the most part. And not everybody can be everything. We argued about the crime bill. We argued about all sorts of stuff. I said, she didn\u2019t sign the crime bill. They were voting for Bernie, who had. Black people showed out. Black women showed out and they showed out in Alabama to stop that pedophile, but we won\u2019t always be there to stop America from destroying itself. We can\u2019t. There\u2019s only 13% of us. But can you imagine that we hold up this world that much? How brilliant are we? Going back to where we started with Black Panther. That\u2019s why we all that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re all that.\n\nYeah, that was another thing I loved about the movie, the importance of every single woman. Going from that to your Get Out role as a police officer. I know Jordan Peele wrote you personally to ask you to be in the movie. What\u2019s your take on how that small character turned out and what feedback did you get?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s so funny, we talked about it after it was put in the can, because I didn\u2019t know really what he saw in me. He said, \u201cErika, you just had a different take.\u201d I had an audition and apparently he wanted me to work the role, but I had so many other guest jobs I was working. Queen Sugar, Bosch and Beyond. He wrote me this gorgeous note that said, \u201cYou brought so much to the role that I didn\u2019t think had that much and you changed my mind on it.\u201d I was reading the note going, \u201cReally?\u201d [Laughs] I said, maybe you gotta show me the audition \u2019cause I don\u2019t know what he talking about. [Laughs] But I came in and did the best I could and Li\u2019l Rel, we had a good time on the set. Jordan couldn\u2019t be nicer, kinder, or more easygoing. And then it becomes a juggernaut cultural hit. People say you can\u2019t know. There\u2019s times you know. Like I said, Living Single, I think we knew that we were gonna be good. On the scale of things, we weren\u2019t as big as the biggest shows but... I had no idea that Get Out was gonna be this way, so I\u2019m really gratified. I had no idea, and he saw it. But it just shows you that the visionary sometimes puts it out there. And then he puts pieces together. You\u2019re not supposed to see all that. You\u2019re supposed to do your piece.\n\nI think people hoped that your character would come back and save the day or something, but I guess that would be putting a lot on the black woman\u2019s shoulder.\n\nOh, I wouldn\u2019t have minded. I think we expect black women to do that. But it was also not just the black woman\u2019s shoulder. That\u2019s where you thought the narrative was going, that she\u2019d come in and be like, \u201chey, stick \u2019em up.\u201d Or whatever. But I love it because everybody has that expectation and maybe this is where Jordan\u2019s smart. Because they see Max. They don\u2019t just see a detective. They think, Oh, Max getting ready to get into this! You know, I\u2019m wearing her face. And then by the end of it, they go, Aw man, she laughed at the black man. Damn. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good that people bring all sorts of baggage from other roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you going to the Oscars? Or will be around it?\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll be around it. How \u2019bout that? [Laughs] I\u2019ma be around it.\n\nYou\u2019re working on a horror project under your company.\n\nYes, Color Farm Media. Myself and Ben Arnon are partners on a new television and tech company called Color Farm Media and one of the things we set up last year was a horror thriller with Lionsgate. Can\u2019t tell you anymore about that, but we\u2019re with them on that. And also a movie about the Boyz Choir of Harlem that we\u2019re going with Tammy Barnes and Paul Barnes, Ava DuVernay\u2019s producing partner. He produced Selma and Queen Sugar. And Electric City, Jamie Patricof\u2019s company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m curious if you got a chance to see Kim Fields on Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\n\n\nYeah, I saw it. [Laughs]\n\nThat season, she was kind of the fish out of water.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what she was. She was like Giles.\n\nIt was funny to see her in that element, knowing her character from Living Single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. You know what. I think she tried something. And I think it\u2019s very hard for somebody, especially like Kim, who grew up in the business. She grew up playing fictional characters. People know her and go, oh that\u2019s Kim Fields, there\u2019s Tutti, there\u2019s Regine. She might\u2019ve thought, well maybe I can hang in a platform like that and make something of it, be comfortable, go toe-to-toe. I don\u2019t know what her thinking was. I give her props for trying. It\u2019s not something I would want to do or think I\u2019d ever do. I can never say never, but for the most part I can\u2019t see myself doing that. I don\u2019t look at it as something that was beneath her. I do think it was something she wasn\u2019t used to. Because we\u2019re not asked as actresses to play parts of ourselves as villains in real life.\n\nThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s just be real. If you have those arguments in front of a camera, you\u2019re not playing Regine. You\u2019re playing yourself. I would never put myself in an argument on camera because I wouldn\u2019t want my mother to see me like that. That\u2019s me. But see, I didn\u2019t come up in that world. My world is very protected by the narrative and the script. I can do anything as Max. Child, I\u2019d rip somebody apart from across the table if they wanted. As Max. But Erika, I wouldn\u2019t do that because who does that make me? And that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s hard to be an actress and then go and say, okay, but I\u2019m playing this role now. Whether they understand it or not, they\u2019re playing roles. They have their own faces on. But those are roles. And I believe she tried something on and then moved on and that was probably the right thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI loved it because her face was always like, what\u2019s going on...?\n\n[Laughs] I think that\u2019s the role she thought she could play. But that role can\u2019t be played on a show like that. You have to engage. You can\u2019t just look on and be a spectator. Nobody wants you looking. They want you to engage and then they want you to participate in a way that undermines or confronts. And if you can\u2019t do that, then you can\u2019t hang.\n\nLast question, one thing about Living Single is that the women were able to afford the brownstones. I live in Brooklyn and was wondering if you thought about how now, obviously, Brooklyn is way more expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI live in Brooklyn, too, partly. I used to live in East New York, which is almost near Brownsville. Still, that\u2019s a place that hasn\u2019t really gotten built up, but I hear that they\u2019ve rezoned it now for high rises. Uh, I don\u2019t know about you, girl, but my mouth dropped when I saw how many people came out of a building that nobody would\u2019ve gone in. There were these white students, women with baby carriages and their lattes. I said, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d There\u2019s a little part of me that was jealous. Because when we were living there, there wasn\u2019t cleanliness, there wasn\u2019t the police presence and if it was, the police presence was shaking and baking folks and stressing us out.\n\nAnd then suddenly, new faces move in that are lighter and suddenly we have all these services and the rent goes up and they\u2019re angry at you and \u201cGet out my way.\u201d Really? Really? That\u2019s really frustrating to see, and I think that\u2019s what hurts black people the most. Like, don\u2019t we get these services? Why can\u2019t we have this expectation? That\u2019s why Black Panther\u2014going back to Wakanda\u2014Wakanda was fabulous. I wish there was a real Wakanda. Girl, I\u2019d have my ticket yesterday. They\u2019d be like, \u201cWhere\u2019s Erika?\u201d I\u2019m in Wakanda, baby. I\u2019m gone. You know how many black people would be on that boat to Wakanda? Or ship, whatever. JetBlue, whatever I need to do to get over there. So yeah, it\u2019s disgusting. And, by the way, Max was the only one out of all of them that could afford her own apartment. So I like to say she was doing the best out of all of them, maybe \u2019cause she was saving money on food.\n\n[Laughs] Right.\n\nEating their food. But you could\u2019ve afforded it back in the day and certainly something like that would\u2019ve been doable then. By the way, I want to say, all the people that come up to me on the street and say they went to law school because of that character. People like Marilyn Mosby who\u2019s over in Baltimore, Maryland. The de Blasios have said that they were inspired by her in politics. I\u2019m not kidding you! And I laughed and [Bill de Blasio] said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t laugh Erika. I\u2019m serious.\u201d I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s the power of the moving image. It moves.

But that may change Thursday as the state prepares to execute 53-year-old Mark Asay, and with a drug that has never been used before in any U.S. execution.\n\nAccording to CBS, with contribution from the Associated Press, barring a stay of execution, Asay is set to die by lethal injection after 6 p.m. Thursday. Asay was convicted by a jury of two racially motivated murders in Jacksonville, Fla., back in 1987.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn anesthetic, etomidate, and two other drugs\u2014rocuronium bromide and potassium acetate\u2014will be used in the lethal injection, the Associated Press reports. The execution will be Florida\u2019s first since the U.S. Supreme Court paused the practice more than 18 months ago following a ruling that the state\u2019s death penalty system was unconstitutional because the state\u2019s sentencing system gave too much power to judges over juries.\n\nExecutions statewide came to a stop as Florida lawmakers drew up new legislation, with the result being that ultimately, a jury is required to unanimously agree before sentencing someone to death, the Washington Post notes.\n\nAsay, a former prison gang member who once had a swastika tattoo, was convicted in the deaths of 34-year-old Robert Lee Booker and 26-year-old Renee Torres, who was originally identified in legal documents as \u201cRobert McDowell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors argued that their race was what incited Asay\u2019s violent behavior in 1987. Witnesses and a jail house informant testified that Asay had used racial slurs while he committed the first murder and after the second.\n\nThe night of the murders, Asay was out drinking with his brother and a friend in Jacksonville when they went looking for prostitutes.\n\nAsay\u2019s brother was inside his vehicle and talking to Booker, who stood outside, when Asay walked up and called Booker a \u201cnigger\u201d before pulling out his gun and shooting him in the stomach. Booker died from internal bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsay and the friend, identified as \u201cBubba\u201d McQuinn, fled in Asay\u2019s truck. McQuinn later testified that when he asked Asay why he shot Booker, Asay said, \u201cBecause you got to show a nigger who is boss.\u201d\n\nAfter killing Booker in cold blood, the two kept on looking for prostitutes and stumbled upon Torres. McQuinn testified that Assay grabbed Torres by the arm and shot six times.\n\nThe jury sentenced Asay to death by a 9-3 vote.\n\nThe case has been in going through the rounds ever since, with the execution first stopped by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However, following that decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that only inmates sentenced to death after 2002 would be allowed new hearings. Asay\u2019s case did not fit that criteria, and his attorneys appealed, unsuccessfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsay then appealed based on the new drug cocktail that would be used, but that was also rejected, with officials defending the use of the new drugs despite reservations about their use.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Department of Corrections follows the law and carries out the sentence of the court,\u201d Michelle Glady, the Florida Department of Corrections\u2019 spokeswoman, said in a statement to AP. \u201cThis is the department\u2019s most solemn duty, and the foremost objective with the lethal-injection procedure is a humane and dignified process.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, another appeal was issued (and rejected) stemming from the racial implications of the case. As the Post notes, for decades, Asay\u2019s victims were both classified as black; however, it turns out that Torres was biracial\u2014white and Hispanic\u2014not black. The court apologized for the mistake and issued a mea culpa, but also ruled that the mistake did not change the outcome of Asay\u2019s death penalty sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnless a court or Florida\u2019s governor decides to step in, Asay\u2019s fate is sealed. He will become the 24th inmate to be executed since Gov. Rick Scott took office, the most under any governor in Florida history, CBS-AP notes.\n\nRead more at CBS News and the Washington Post here and here.", "keywords": ["fla", "booker", "florida", "used", "death", "black", "testified", "white", "asay", "court", "torres", "supreme", "asays", "killing", "man", "inmate", "executed"], "polarity": 0.05055282555282556, "subjectivity": 0.35792383292383295},

Lesser (AP Images)\n\nI was perusing the internet streets like I always do looking for what\u2019s good in the hood when I came across an article from BuzzFeed that made me clutch my pearls, then touch my chest and say, \u201cWhy, I never!\u201d The headline? \u201cWe Found the Girl Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song and Sis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nThe article, penned by BuzzFeed staff writer Essence Gant, is one of those joints that I assume was written by somebody young(er)\u2014according to this the Life Currency interview, she\u2019s likely 31 now\u2014who maybe came across Living Single more recently and was excited and enthused about the lives of Khadijah, Max, Regine, Synclaire, Overton and Kyle and probably binged the show after it was made available on Hulu back in January.\n\nNothing about this is a bad thing. It is a great show and bingeworthy, and the theme music and the opening dance number are awesome. My guess is that the writer took a shining to the intro and was like, \u201cI wonder who that is. I\u2019m a writer; let me dig into the crates.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, those of us who grew up in the \u201990s, both on and with hip-hop, know and have always known that it was Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar in that dance number. Her silhouette was distinctive and we knew her from hosting Rap City, acting and choreographing videos for damn near everybody\u2014from Michael Jordan to Mary J. Blige. While I\u2019m not going to pretend that Big Lez was a mainstream household name, in the hip-hop world (a large part of the target demo for Living Single), we knew Big Lez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to me clutching my pearls and shit. When I read the headline that referred to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl,\u201d I felt like some unintentional shade was being thrown. I say unintentional because if you read the actual article (who does that?) you\u2019ll see that Ms. Gant thinks highly of Big Lez:\n\nAfter digging around the internet, we found out that the infamous choreographer is Leslie \u201cBig Lez\u201d Segar, @yourgirllez on Instagram, and sis is #skingoals, #fitgoals, all the goals.\n\nShe\u2019s been a professional dancer and has worked with some of music\u2019s biggest legends. This video of her and Mary J. Blige is the cutest #blackgirlmagic nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s Big Lez, famed VJ who had some classic interviews and episodes of Rap City. She\u2019s a real basket of kittens and always has been. So again, I\u2019m sure Gant knows this and feels this and means no harm by referring to Big Lez as \u201cthe Girl\u201d\u2014hell, the title ends with \u201cSis Looks Good as Hell.\u201d\n\nBut would it have been that much trouble to add her name to the title instead of making it seem like she was just some woman who danced in the intro and wasn\u2019t a somebody BEFORE she did that? We knew who she was. By \u201cwe,\u201d I mean hip-hop. In my view, calling her \u201cthe girl\u201d diminishes her star. It implies that most people\u2014or likely most people who read BuzzFeed\u2014wouldn\u2019t register her name enough to warrant mentioning it.\n\nEven still, \u201cWe Found Big Lez, Who Danced to Living Single\u2019s Theme Song, and Sis Looks Good as Hell\u201d works just as well as the current title, no? I didn\u2019t know what she\u2019s been up to, and I wager many folks don\u2019t. But not even calling her by her name? That feels unnecessarily disrespectful. But maybe I\u2019m making a mountain out of a molehill. Maybe it\u2019s just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m gonna take it as disrespect, even if it\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m not going to turn it into a larger discussion about marginalizing black women; after all, the author of the \u201carticle\u201d is a black woman.\n\nAlso, you see how I put the word \u201carticle\u201d in quotes? Here\u2019s the situation: I\u2019m not sure if the source piece is actually an article\u2014the letters are huge, there are tons of hashtags, and it\u2019s largely GIFs and pictures. Hell, it\u2019s basically a list of pictures with lots of captions. But it\u2019s a byline, so it\u2019s an article, right? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to not call it one\u2014get your money, girl\u2014but me adding those quotes makes it seem like I\u2019m mocking or belittling, basically being disrespectful. But I don\u2019t mean it that way.\n\nAnyway, is it me? Am I tripping? Or does the headline seem mad disrespectful, even if unintentionally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInquiring minds would like to know.", "keywords": ["dont", "living", "writer", "im", "article", "know", "headline", "good", "lez", "sis", "mad", "buzzfeeds", "disrespectful", "big"], "polarity": 0.10394088669950739, "subjectivity": 0.44401340996168576},

My 5-year-old nephew has apparently reached the age where bald curiosity meets peak candor, because he\u2019s taken to asking me this question every time we see each other, as we did a few days ago. My response is always the same: \u201cHoney, why do you want me to be married?\u201d\n\nMore than once he\u2019s said shyly, while hanging off my neck, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d\n\nOuch. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not alone. I have you, and your sister, and Mommy and Daddy, and Grammy and Papa ... \u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think you should get married,\u201d he earnestly insists.\n\nOK, enough philosophy; time to get real with this kid: \u201cWell, what would I need to be married?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, he always screws up his adorable little face, as if I\u2019ve asked him the meaning of life ... or whether he\u2019s brushed his teeth yet.\n\n\u201cHmm ... a husband?\u201d\n\nEnd of discussion, thank God.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day can be an embarrassment of riches rich with embarrassment for single people, whether it\u2019s a 5-year-old deeply concerned about you dying alone, or a well-meaning, happily married colleague who suggests that you do a story on the statistical undesirability of black, single women in online dating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd no matter how much one\u2019s version of alone differs from lonely, if I\u2019m honest, it always stings, at least a little.\n\nBut then I think back to last Valentine\u2019s Day, when I was a freelance creative trying to figure out my next big chess move. Only a week before, I\u2019d moved back to my hometown after a 24-year absence\u2014in part because the man I\u2019d long been dating long-distance lived there.\n\nBut instead of feeling at home, I was sad, scared, set adrift, waiting for a sign, and starting to have the growing suspicion that my \u201cboyfriend\u201d liked me much better when we weren\u2019t in the same area code. That suspicion would prove true months later, when an out-of-town friend spotted him on Tinder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, I was lonely\u2014far lonelier than I am now, when I\u2019m basically married to my job (a concept I thought a bit too advanced for my nephew). But somewhere between trying to meet a man halfway and getting The Glow Up up and running, I went missing.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it was my constant attempts to be accommodating, the constant grind of trying to learn on my feet, or just the constant pressure to be all things all the time and never quite feeling that I was measuring up, but I allowed myself to get lost in the mix. I checked out, and I must admit, checking back in is harder than I thought.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone; every day I engage with the incredible growing community in The Glow Up Facebook group, and see myself reflected in the women there, all of us trying to stay present and connected\u2014even when we\u2019re not quite sure what to connect ourselves to anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve realized, as many of us do, that love is a choice; a choice we must make over and over again\u2014sometimes in spite of everything else. But all too often, our concept of love remains fixed to factors that we have very little choice in at all, like waiting to get \u201cchose\u201d or finding someone \u201cworthy\u201d of choosing.\n\nWhy do we do that? Is it because it\u2019s easier to throw our fates to the wind than to choose ourselves, even if no one else does?\n\nI can\u2019t currently claim loneliness; my life is too full of deadlines, and meetings, and personalities, and way too much stuff. I also don\u2019t think about marriage much these days\u2014there are lots of reasons I\u2019m not married, and some of them are entirely on me. And, thankfully, I can say without bitterness that I don\u2019t even miss my ex. When I think back on him and the men who preceded him, I feel no regret.

The Brooklyn, N.Y., MC from Bed-Stuy is one of the all-time greats, and despite his small catalog\u2014two proper studio releases, Ready to Die (1994) and Life After Death (1997)\u2014he is highly revered in the hip-hop community. And he is STILL the MC I\u2019m most impressed by.\n\n\n\nJay-Z is my favorite rapper of all time. Some of that is due to my undying loyalty to his debut album, Reasonable Doubt. The rest is due to how many songs and albums of his I enjoy, how good a rapper he was at his height (and how long that height was) and how much better he is at rapping than so many others, even now. Greats gon\u2019 great.\n\nBut even as great as Jay is, Biggie will always be the one who makes me laugh and shake my head at his sheer ability and witty wordplay. Even on Reasonable Doubt, Biggie and Jay traded bars on \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest\u201d in a real Ali-vs.-Frazier-style rap-off, and Biggie\u2019s lines STILL stand above them all:\n\nMe and Gutta had two spots, the two-for-five dollar hits, the blue tops, gotta go Coolio, mean it\u2019s getting too hot, if Fay [Faith] had twins she\u2019d probably have two Pacs, get it, Tupac\u2019s ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat STILL gives me the warm-and-fuzzies. And this is on a track where Jay said, \u201cLike short sleeves, I bear arms ... \u201d Those guys.\n\nListening to the back-to-back bangers \u201cUnbelievable\u201d and \u201cSuicidal Thoughts\u201d (among the rest of the records on the album), I can\u2019t help being impressed by how lyrically dextrous he was on \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d where he famously weaved \u201crecent shenanigans\u201d into the first verse.\n\n\u201cSuicidal Thoughts\u201d was a clinic in storytelling, dark as it was. \u201cJuicy,\u201d which is still one of my favorites of his, is inspirational, a real hood success story. Ready to Die was a classic the moment it was released for showing us the promise Biggie exhibited on \u201cParty and Bullshit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he only leveled up on Life After Death. There is one song where every single time I listen to it, I get sad for what could have been\u2014at the same time, I also feel fortunate for having grown up in a time where I got to experience a rapper who was so good at what he did\u2014and that\u2019s \u201cKick in the Door\u201d (a song with a beat that Puffy famously didn\u2019t like). \u201cKick in the Door\u201d is Biggie\u2019s lyrical beatdown to \u201cthose that choose to use disrespectful views on the king of NY.\u201d\n\nThat song should be studied in classes about creative writing for how perfect the wordplay is. And \u201cI Got a Story to Tell\u201d? Bruh. Easily one of the top five greatest stories on hip-hop wax ever. And truthfully, I could go song for song on both of his albums and talk about how his lyrics and craft are unparalleled, but to know Biggie is to already know his talent. Even Born Again, his posthumous release, featured \u201cDead Wrong,\u201d which, good gracious. One day, I promise you, I listened to it 20 times in a row.\n\nI won\u2019t say that there aren\u2019t other MCs who are as capable as Biggie. We\u2019ve had a few; Jay-Z comes to mind, and who can forget other cats like Andr\u00e9 3000 and even Prodigy from Mobb Deep, who I don\u2019t think gets nearly the credit he deserves? But if you take the best assets of the best rappers to ever do it, Biggie had at least an above-average mastery of each of them. He had personality, wit, lyrics, flow, swag, humor, edge and every other characteristic you could want in a rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year on March 9, we celebrate him; it\u2019s been 21 years since he passed away. And every year, when I listen to my Biggie albums, I still find myself smiling and appreciating his gifts and what he did give us while he was here. He impressed me with his skills, something that only a few rappers have ever done. Any rapper would be smart to attempt to emulate him. He had it all.\n\nWe\u2019ll always love Big Poppa.", "keywords": ["impressed", "biggie", "song", "mc", "impresses", "good", "rapper", "later", "notorious", "21", "albums", "jay", "wordplay", "big", "life", "aka"], "polarity": 0.23452737077737076, "subjectivity": 0.5515837403337402},

He was 24 years old. He was gunned down after leaving an industry party in Los Angeles, six months after the death of rapper Tupac Shakur. Being from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and seeing how this entire New York City community came together to mourn\u2014by pouring into the streets and openly grieving\u2014helped me learn how to understand death and loss in a way that I didn\u2019t get at home.\n\n\n\nI was one month shy of my second birthday when my biological mother died. I don\u2019t remember anything about my mother\u2019s death, her funeral or what happened immediately after. I have no memory of my mother. I don\u2019t know what she smelled like. I cannot recall what her voice sounded like, how she laughed or how she walked. All I had was a photo album of pictures of her with her friends, ex-lovers and middle school class.\n\nTwo years later, my father would lose his battle to Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. I remember some things about my father. How tall he was and how white his teeth seemed to be. I have memories of a trip to the zoo, of him purchasing me a life-size Barney and giving me a puppy we named Matrix. While I didn\u2019t remember much about either of my parents, one thing was true: They were both gone before my first day of kindergarten.\n\nAlthough I was far too young to process my parents\u2019 deaths when I was 7, I was clear that Biggie Smalls had died, that he wasn\u2019t coming back, and that many people whom I knew and loved were really upset, a phenomenon I would later learn was called grief.\n\nI remember returning to school the week after Biggie\u2019s death. I attended a small Christian school in Bed-Stuy\u2014I jokingly say I attended a \u201chistorically black elementary school.\u201d Murder, violence, drugs, territory, beef\u2014none of that was fictitious to us. Many of us knew and loved someone who had been a victim of gun violence. We tried to keep our whispering down; we weren\u2019t even supposed to talk about rap music\u2014it was the \u201cdevil\u2019s music,\u201d according to the school administrators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though we were in first grade, my classmates and I knew all the words to \u201cBig Poppa,\u201d \u201cJuicy\u201d and \u201cOne More Chance.\u201d While our understanding of the world was still being crafted, we connected with the realities in B.I.G.\u2019s songs\u2014because for black kids growing up in Bed-Stuy, those were some of our realities, too.\n\n\n\nBiggie\u2019s life meant a lot to us, but his death meant more to me.\n\nI always knew that I wasn\u2019t like the other children. I would listen to adults in my family stumble over questions from school administrators about my parents. Where were they? How did they die? What was I feeling? They would hush a rowdy uncle when he would start reminiscing about good times with Strike (my father) or quickly change the conversation when the topic of how fashionable Delores (my mother) was came up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can only hope that they were trying to shield me from hurt, but when it came to discussing my parents\u2019 death, I always felt alone. I had so many questions about death and dying. Where did they go when they died? How did they split their time between the cemetery and heaven? If they were in heaven, why do we keep bringing flowers to this cemetery in New Jersey? My family made frequent visits to my parents\u2019 graves (holidays, birthdays, anniversaries of their deaths, all the days). That\u2019s how they grieved. I preferred to grieve differently, but at age 5 I had no platform to voice my concerns. I had no one to talk to.\n\nI spent too much time feeling angry that I didn\u2019t have my own memories of my parents. And the memories that other people had, they seemed to hold on to tightly, rarely sharing them with me. Because I didn\u2019t know everything about my parents, I felt as if I couldn\u2019t love them like everyone else did. B.I.G.\u2019s death showed me how diverse groups of people had birthed him, recorded music with him and mentored him, and some (like me) who had just listened to his music. We all had different relationships with him\u2014but all loved him. I could create my own memories of my parents and love them for that, always.\n\nI remember the day when people came back to the block after standing on Fulton Street watching the procession of Biggie\u2019s hearse through the streets. I was home because I was 7, but I remember people saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone.\u201d I felt the sadness and heaviness of my community\u2019s loss in particular, as if I had lost someone. The air was heavy, and people were mad at the West Coast, where I had never been.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Mark Lennihan (AP Images)\n\nI remember watching the news footage of people in the street when they started playing \u201cHypnotize\u201d to the crowd. I knew that it was OK to celebrate life and what people had given you while they were on earth. I wanted to know what my parents left behind\u2014where I could find the joy in their existence, as people found in Biggie\u2019s songs when his mother, Voletta Wallace, returned home to Bed-Stuy.\n\n\n\nI was never told that crying, or feeling angry and upset, was OK. That these were normal and just reactions to death. People pouring into the streets, crying publicly at award shows and TV interviews, showed me that I didn\u2019t need to cry in the closet or the bathroom. That there was nothing to be ashamed of. My pain was valid, and all people feel that as a part of life. I was not alone. B.I.G.\u2019s death normalized grief for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than that day, I remember the songs and videos that came out following his death\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ll Always Love Big Poppa\u201d especially, because they have children in them. Every time these videos came on, I would stand directly in front of the TV, mesmerized, and sing along with Diddy (then Puff Daddy), Faith Evans and 112. I remember Diddy rapping, \u201cIn the future, can\u2019t wait to see if you\u2019ll open up the gates for me,\u201d and children dressed in all white running into what looked like forever, one of them his daughter, Tyanna.\n\nYears after Biggie\u2019s death, I would think about his children. They were rich, but would they be, like me, orphans? Tyanna was 3 years old and Christopher Jr. was only 4 months old at the time of their father\u2019s death. Would they remember their father? Have someone to talk to about his death? Did they secretly cry in the bathroom or the closet when they missed him? Learn the word \u201cgrief\u201d before they were in high school?\n\nLess than a month after Biggie\u2019s death, Life After Death was released. To me, this was B.I.G. living beyond the grave. It allowed me to move past the memories of my father\u2019s funeral, what those tiny red roses that we placed on his coffin smelled like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father, my mother and even B.I.G. had more living to do after the funeral services were over. Every time I heard a song from Life After Death, I believed that more and more. My parents did not leave me an album to be released posthumously, but they created me. I am my parents\u2019 legacy\u2014I get to be that. I am a living manifestation of their hopes and dreams and the continuance of their lives here on earth. I don\u2019t believe that they are just resting but, rather, that they are here resisting, creating joy and building black futures alongside me and inside me every day.\n\nI loved the Notorious B.I.G., who made music about surviving and thriving despite the odds. That\u2019s what I had to do as a black girl who lost both of her parents while growing up in Bed-Stuy in the 1990s. This would change a little bit after a few women\u2019s studies courses and a deep dive into Joan Morgan\u2019s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: My Life as a Hip-Hop Feminist. Nevertheless, Biggie still has a place on my altar and in my heart today because his death and how the world reacted to it helped me do what I now know was grieve.\n\nBrittany Brathwaite is a reproductive-justice activist, writer for Echoing Ida and co-founder of the Homegirl Box.

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style.

Jay Z was the executive producer of the series.\n\n\n\nA week before the docuseries\u2019 final episode aired in late March on Spike TV, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio revealed a 10-year plan to close Rikers, a complex plagued by accusations of corruption and abuse. On April 10, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Browder\u2019s family at his side, signed a bill that prohibited the state from charging 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. City Public Advocate Letitia James has also launched a campaign to rename the island after Browder when Rikers is finally shut down, HuffPost notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["renamed", "island", "honor", "browder", "intersection", "huffpost", "man", "ny", "kalief", "rikers", "york", "docuseries", "bronx", "unveiled"], "polarity": 0.047418630751964085, "subjectivity": 0.4760662177328844},

Blige at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z accidentally teased a joint tour. Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a concert date for a previously unannounced stadium stint: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field. Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show. That\u2019s a lot less lead time than other tours of this size, but they could be prepping for it right this very second, so who knows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, they probably don\u2019t need to make the same preparations as other artists, so let \u2019em do whatever they want\u2014as long as we get the tour.

At 22, what seemed like a statement of fact to me brought a look of horror to the face of my friend\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d she said. From the alarm in her voice, it was clear she felt that I\u2019d put a curse on my soul and announced to the room that I didn\u2019t love myself. She reassured me that, yes, marriage was possible for me.\n\n\n\nThat conversation taught me that there are some topics you can\u2019t discuss with everyone. As a woman, you\u2019re supposed to want marriage and kids. And if you don\u2019t, people are prone to try to convince you that you\u2019ll change your mind or that you\u2019re just saying what you\u2019re saying because you\u2019re single; once you meet the right person, you\u2019ll get out the bridal magazines and get ready for those babies.\n\nBut almost a decade later, I\u2019m still making the same statement I made to my friend\u2019s mother at 22. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m anti-marriage; but on my long list of life goals, it\u2019s not even on the list. If it happens, I\u2019ll be happy. But if I never make it to the altar, I won\u2019t shed any tears.\n\nDuring my early 20, I had a very close relationship with one of my college professors. Her romantic life was my inspiration for love\u2014this was long before the hashtag #RelationshipGoals became a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember one day, her then-boyfriend came over unannounced\u2014and without her asking\u2014to pressure-wash her house. I repeat, HE CAME OVER TO PRESSURE-WASH HER HOUSE. I knew then that I\u2019d witnessed true love.\n\nMy professor had been with her partner for over a decade, owned her home and was working on getting her Ph.D. People were always asking her why she wouldn\u2019t just marry her boyfriend already. \u201cI would\u2019ve been a terrible wife if I\u2019d married him earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to wait until I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nWell, doesn\u2019t that sound reasonable, I thought. I decided that I, too, would wait until I\u2019d gotten my life together before getting married. Almost a decade later, I still haven\u2019t gotten my life together\u2014but I\u2019m confident that it\u2019ll happen someday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years passed, and my professor got her Ph.D., married her boo and had a baby. I confided in her that I admired her relationship trajectory and told her I was also going to wait until later in life to get married. She was aghast.\n\n\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t follow what I did!\u201d she said. \u201cDo what\u2019s right for you.\u201d\n\nShe tried to reject being my #RelationshipGoals, but it was too late. She\u2019d already inspired me. (You can\u2019t reject my admiration!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I turned 30, my thoughts on marriage didn\u2019t change, but it suddenly seemed like everyone my age was getting married and having kids. My Facebook feed morphed from posts about general shenanigans to posts about engagements, anniversaries and babies. Was this something I was supposed to be doing? Was I failing at life? Had I missed the boat?\n\nI mean, I suppose I could\u2019ve just found some random guy and gotten married the next day. But do you know what\u2019s way worse than being single? Being in a horrible marriage with someone you hate, and having to see that person every day for the rest of your life. Who wants that kind of negativity? Not me.\n\nWitnessing the dissolution of my parents\u2019 relationship stripped away any idealization of marriage for me. Marriage is hard. Really hard. Divorce is even harder. And I\u2019m too lazy to be spending energy on a marriage with someone I\u2019m only with because society says I need to be married to have a purpose in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are other reasons marriage may not be in the cards for me: I like to move. A lot. I may move tomorrow. Who knows? Marriage would be the death of all that. I also love living alone. I don\u2019t ever want to shack up with a boyfriend\u2014but I\u2019m sure that any potential husband would likely want us to move in together. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s part of the whole marriage deal.\n\nSometimes\u2014OK, all the time\u2014I\u2019m envious of couples with the double-income life. I look at my financial struggles and fantasize that if I were married, there would be someone to help shoulder the costs of the bills, plan trips, run errands and take care of things if I got sick\u2014or, God forbid, broke a hip.\n\nBut then I remember what I\u2019d be giving up for all of that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live alone. I wouldn\u2019t be able to move whenever I got the urge. I couldn\u2019t make a midnight run to the grocery store for a pint of ice cream. OK, I could probably still do that, but I\u2019d have to tell the hubby I was leaving and wait to see if he wanted to come along. Who has time for all that when you\u2019re jonesing for an ice cream fix?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her speech at Glamour\u2019s 2017 Women of the Year Summit, actress Tracee Ellis Ross talked about being 45 and single without kids. She said:\n\nMy worth gets diminished as I am reminded that I have \u201cfailed\u201d on the marriage and carriage counts. ... Those two #goals: being chosen and having kids, are what makes you worthy. ... I am trying to gather all this energy around me, step into it, and match it with my realization that my life is mine. ... It means risking being misunderstood, perceived as alone and broken, having no one to focus on, fall into or hide behind, having to be my own support and having to stretch and find family love and connection outside of the traditional places. But I want to do it. I want to be the brave me, the real me, the one whose life is my own.\n\nHearing Ross speak so frankly about being single was refreshing. So often\u2014too often\u2014people don\u2019t talk publicly about being single. Singlehood is something you\u2019re supposed to be ashamed about; something you\u2019re supposed to be trying your hardest to fix. And if you\u2019re a woman, no one believes you if you say you\u2019re happy without a husband or kids. It seems everyone is convinced that you\u2019re crying yourself to sleep at night, waiting for your real life to begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the right person comes along, I\u2019ll be more than happy to tie the knot. But that being said, I\u2019ve gotten to know myself pretty well over the years. I may never get married. But if I do, it won\u2019t be until I meet someone who voluntarily comes over to pressure-wash my house.*\n\n*I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to afford a house, so this scenario may not actually be feasible. However, if any potential boo came over and detailed my car without my having to ask, I\u2019d be just as happy.", "keywords": ["dont", "living", "youre", "im", "marriedand", "married", "kids", "single", "marriage", "id", "having", "life", "fine"], "polarity": 0.12121212121212123, "subjectivity": 0.5279741236772487},

Rick Scott after he stripped her office of some 23 first-degree murder cases because she refused to pursue the death penalty.\n\nAccording to CNN, Ayala, the state attorney for the 9th Judicial Circuit, claims that Scott\u2019s decision violated her constitutional rights, marred her reputation and deprived those who elected her \u201cof the benefit of their votes\u201d after he assigned her cases to another prosecutor.\n\n\u201cThe governor did not take this drastic step because of any misconduct on Ayala\u2019s part, but simply because he disagreed with her reasoned prosecutorial determination not to seek the death penalty under current circumstances,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nCurrently, 5th Judicial Circuit State Attorney Brad King, who is also named as a defendant, has been handed the cases.\n\nThe discord between Scott and Ayala started after Ayala refused to consider the death penalty in two separate high-profile cases involving Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing Orlando Police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton and his ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon, who was pregnant at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyala also said that she would not pursue the death penalty in future cases, citing various reasons, including studies that show it provides no public safety benefits, is not a deterrent and ends up costing the state more than cases in which the defendant is sentenced to life. Ayala also said that the death penalty gives victims\u2019 families false hope.\n\n\u201cSome victims will support and some will surely oppose my decision, but I have learned that death penalty traps many victims\u2019 families in decadeslong cycle of uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201c ... I cannot in good faith look a victim\u2019s family in the face and promise that a death sentence handed down in our courts will ever result in execution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor expressed his displeasure with Ayala\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe moment I heard that she had decided not to prosecute Markeith Loyd to the full extent of the law, it bothered me personally,\u201d the governor said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott said he asked the prosecutor to recuse herself from Loyd\u2019s case in March, but when she refused, he reassigned it to King, giving a nod to the families of Dixon and Clayton and that of Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Norman Lewis, who died in a crash during the manhunt for Loyd.\n\n\u201cThese families deserve a state attorney who will aggressively prosecute Loyd to the fullest extent of the law and justice must be served,\u201d he said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Ayala insists that state law gives her \u201cabsolute\u201d discretion in deciding how to deal with cases, and that the defendants violated her rights \u201cwhen they assumed the authority to veto the prosecutorial discretion of an independent elected official,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Scott chose King as a replacement because of his \u201cwell-known\u201d support for the death penalty, painting Scott\u2019s decision as being \u201cmotivated by a specific desire to influence the course of capital prosecutions in Ayala\u2019s circuit.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction to order Scott to reinstate Ayala as prosecutor on the cases and prohibit him from replacing her with any other state official. She is also seeking an injunction to prevent King from taking up her duties.\n\n\u201cState Attorney Aramis Ayala has the right to use her discretion to determine how and to what extent she\u2019s going to prosecute cases in her district. That is the right that the voters gave her,\u201d her attorney, Roy Austin of Washington, D.C., said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2016, when Ayala was elected, she became the first African-American state attorney in Florida. Her term only began in January.\n\nHer lawsuit emphasizes that Ayala would be willing to consider the death penalty in \u201cappropriate\u201d cases, adding that she came to her decision to seek life without parole in Loyd\u2019s case after researching the law and the facts of the case and meeting with victims\u2019 families, reviewing files from other cases, and speaking with others involved in the criminal-justice system.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Scott of mischaracterizing \u201cAyala\u2019s careful weighing of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the governor asked her to recuse herself, \u201cshe refused and asked him for the opportunity to explain her position.

Gross also said that implicit racism is also a factor.\n\nIn murder cases, innocent blacks are about seven times more likely than innocent white people to be convicted. Gross told CNN that this was partially because homicide rates among black people are higher than among white people, therefore causing innocent black people to be more likely to be suspected and convicted of murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, the study notes that murder exonerations with black defendants were 22 percent more likely to include misconduct by police officers than those of their white counterparts. Also, on average, innocent black people spend three years longer in prison before they are released than white people who end up being exonerated. Those sentenced to death spend four years longer in prison.\n\nBlack prisoners who are convicted of murder are also about 50 percent more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers, with the disparity partially being tied to the race of the victim. According to the study, imprisoned African Americans are more likely to be innocent if they were convicted of killing white victims.\n\nIn terms of sexual assault, a black prisoner is three-and-a-half times more likely to be innocent than a white person wrongfully convicted of sexual assault. Much of the racial disparity in sexual assault convictions is related to white victims who mistakenly identify black assailants. The study notes that assaults on white women by black men are a small minority of all sexual assaults in the U.S., but constitute half of sexual assaults with eyewitness misidentifications that later lead to an exoneration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes: \u201cEyewitness misidentifications do not completely explain the racial disparity in sexual assault exonerations. Some misidentifications themselves are in part the products of racial bias, and other convictions that led to sexual assault exonerations were marred by implicit biases, racially tainted official misconduct and, in some cases, explicit racism.\u201d\n\nLastly, in drug crimes, the study reports that national evidence shows blacks and whites use illegal drugs at the same rate ... however, black Americans are still five times as likely to go to prison for drug possession and about 12 times more likely to be wrongfully convicted of drug crimes.\n\nThe study points out that the racial disparity is rooted in police enforcing drug laws more vigorously against black Americans, noting that African Americans are stopped, searched, arrested and convicted more frequently, even in cases when they are innocent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince 1989, more than 1,800 defendants have been cleared in \u2018group exonerations\u2019 that followed 15 large-scale police scandals in which officers systematically framed innocent defendants,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThe great majority were African-American defendants who were framed for drug crimes that never occurred.

As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides. It\u2019s hard to stay mad in Ferragamo slippers and sippin\u2019 Dom Perignon, or at least not that White Star!\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll bet Common laughs to the bank (or more likely laughs when direct deposit hits) every time he thinks about where he started and where he is now. He has made the absolute most of the hip-hop game. Folks reach out to him to do songs for major motion pictures that end up nominated for Academy Awards for the most vapid, boring, black-music-for-white-people bullshit (like \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d with Andra Day, which might as well have been called \u201cGlory-er\u201d), and they cut big checks.\n\nHell, I\u2019m wondering if he even tries anymore, and he still secures the bag every time. His latest album, Black America Again, even missed the mark despite its supreme timeliness. There were some familiar flashes of brilliance and very solid production. It just didn\u2019t have ... it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty much, he\u2019s dad rap now\u2014he is a father\u2014but he still has all the respect of the hip-hop community for past achievements in the inner-city hip-hop arts. White people can look at Common and say, \u201cI like that Common; \u2018Glory\u2019 was so moving and inspirational and really made me rethink that hippety-hop,\u201d and the rest of us just say, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s good to see him rich and shit, and at least we got Like Water for Chocolate.\u201d Common is out here being the change he wants to see. Corny as the results may be at times, I get how it happens.\n\nCommon has secured the bag.", "keywords": ["say", "im", "shit", "album", "common", "rap", "bag", "secured", "past", "white", "hiphop", "rapper", "dad", "makes"], "polarity": 0.02169471297290849, "subjectivity": 0.4743516529418785},

Its legacy alone has dismissed critics (i.e., Newsweek\u2019s 1993 article with its \u201cbooty-shaking sugar mamas\u201d comment), paving the way for shows like Insecure, and still reigns as a beloved fixture of black entertainment and pop culture.\n\n\n\nThe show\u2019s creator\u2014television writer and executive producer Yvette Lee Bowser, now 52\u2014saw the need for a strong black female voice in the television landscape in the early 1990s. After leaving A Different World (she wrote the iconic 1992 wedding episode, \u201cSave the Best for Last,\u201d as her goodbye) for new opportunities, and while producing Hanging With Mr. Cooper, she created the concept for Living Single.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel blessed that my vision and the characters have stuck with people through the decades. It\u2019s a blessing to set out to make art, make TV and to end up making history. It feels great. It makes me smile, and it\u2019s certainly something to be proud of,\u201d Bowser tells The Root. \u201cAfter A Different World went off the air, it left a void. There was no longer a platform for strong black female voices. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t see myself. That was my impetus for creating the show.\u201d\n\n\n\nInspired by the chronicles of her personal life, the show focused on six black 20-somethings living in a Brooklyn, N.Y., brownstone juggling their love lives, careers, friendship and making sense of life in \u201ca \u201990s kind of world.\u201d\n\n\n\nStarring Queen Latifah (Khadijah), Kim Coles (Synclaire), Kim Fields (Regine), Erika Alexander (Max), T.C. Carson (Kyle) and John Henton (Overton), the show debuted on Aug. 22, 1993, after Martin, becoming an immediate ratings hit. Through Bowser\u2019s production company, SisterLee, Living Single became one of the most popular sitcoms\u2014ranking among the top five in African-American households for its entire five-year run. At age 27, Bowser made history by becoming the first black woman to develop a hit prime-time series.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe blessing for me is that we\u2019ve been on the air since \u201993. Since the show premiered, it\u2019s been on somebody\u2019s network,\u201d Living Single co-star Henton says of the show\u2019s syndication. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a marathon running of Living Single somewhere right now. Not bad for my first show.\u201d\n\n\n\nActress-comedian Coles, who transitioned to Living Single from the sketch-comedy show In Living Color, recalls the \u201cjoy, laughter and hilarity\u201d of being on set of Living Single.\n\n\n\n\u201cLaughter every single day. We actually became friends and did things together. A lot of people don\u2019t know that T.C. and Erika\u2014Max and Kyle\u2014have the same birthday. I was there the day that they discovered it,\u201d Coles says. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken birthday trips together, we\u2019ve celebrated relationships coming together, relationships falling apart. You become family. We made our crew laugh, we\u2019ve gotten on our crew\u2019s nerves. We had a magical connection. The experience that I\u2019ve had on Living Single overall has raised the bar for me of what I want on a set going forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson says that what he thought \u201cwas just another job\u201d he\u2019d booked turned into his \u201cmaking friendships that would last a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel grateful and blessed to ... have been a part of something that has that type of impact. To be a part of something that was that iconic. Not everybody gets the chance in their life to be a part of something like that,\u201d Carson says.\n\n\n\nMentoring a new generation of television writers, Bowser calls her career of producing shows and telling stories that resonate with audiences \u201cone of the greatest privileges, responsibilities and joys\u201d of her life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root talked with Kim Coles, Erika Alexander, John Hinton and T.C. Carson about the show\u2019s legacy.\n\n\n\nOn the show being celebrated today:\n\nKim Coles: Well it absolutely warms my heart when people come up and say, \u201cYou\u2019re part of my childhood,\u201d \u201cI was like you.\u201d People call me Synclaire or go \u201cSo-and-so is my favorite character\u201d or \u201cThank you so much for being such a positive view of young black people.\u201d So, it has been an incredible ride, and I knew from the moment that we first all six sat down to read the script that it was going to be magical. Like, I knew immediately that we were meant to be together and I had a strong feeling that it would last; I had no idea that it would last this long, and the legacy has lasted this long, but I\u2019m so grateful. It\u2019s been a fun ride, an absolute fun ride.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Henton: That\u2019s the biggest blessing for me, that people still love it after all of these years. When I was growing up it was Good Times, Sanford and Son, the great shows of that era. Nobody had ever seen young black stockbrokers, black lawyers, black publishers. Even though I was a handyman, I was proud and I was good at what I did. These were young people on the go, coming up. It was fresh, it was new, and it\u2019d never been done before.\n\n\n\nWhat they like about their characters:\n\nT.C. Carson: His commitment to his people and his culture. That was the thing I wanted to push with that character. We hadn\u2019t really seen that on TV from a black man who was in the position he was in. A black man that worked on Wall Street that was a stockbroker that had the kind of financial influence that he had. He was also an amalgamation of quite a few people in my life: my father, a lawyer friend of mine, a couple of doctor friends of mine. So I pulled from the people that I knew to create this persona of this person who I thought we should see.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErika Alexander: I had a history of having strong women around me. I went to an all-girls high school, I\u2019ve been taught by really strong women, my mother is a strong woman. When I see Max, I see Whoopi Goldberg, I see Cicely Tyson, I see those strong \u201970s women that I grew up looking at. She was a young black woman with dark skin who had a career. Most importantly, she was sexually free and did not apologize for being strong or smart, and she certainly didn\u2019t apologize for liking sex.\n\n\n\nJH: Overton was simple, but he was smart. He had his own homespun wisdom. People always laugh, but he was the smartest guy on the show. He just had a crazy country way of putting it, but he knew exactly what was going on. Maybe he wasn\u2019t college-educated, but he knew what was up. He had that old-school wisdom, and the fact that he was in love with Synclaire\u2014that was his woman, that was his goal in life. To get with that woman. And he made that happen.\n\n\n\nKC: Synclaire is a piece of who I am. I\u2019m an awkward black girl; I always have been. I think that Synclaire allowed me to embrace that and be weird and be a unicorn, and be all right with it. She gave other young black girls or other women, in general, an opportunity to embrace being weird or different or a little quirky. So she\u2019s very much who I am at my core. I\u2019m less naive than she is, and I don\u2019t like trolls like she does, but that childlike curiosity of the world, loving on people, is who I am at the core.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship with Yvette Lee Bowser:\n\nYvette Lee Bowser: They were extraordinarily talented, and they had chemistry like no other. Immediately! We caught lightning in a bottle when we assembled this cast, and that\u2019s what you have to do to be in contention to have a hit show. You really need to capture that chemistry. It takes skill and it takes luck. Each of the actors cared about their characters in such a way that they brought a new dimension to them.\n\nKC: I don\u2019t know if Yvette gets the credit that she\u2019s due. She was just seasoned and just so smart. She was smart and beautiful and really cared deeply about creating an experience for the audience that was uplifting. And I know today we use the word \u201cwoke.\u201d We had several topics that could fall into the woke category, and you have Yvette to thank for that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJH: She was cool. She was very giving. We would always go meet with Yvette and talk about the character and pitch some ideas. They would go and write it, but she was always open to our opinions, and anytime where a line wasn\u2019t working, then you\u2019d have something in your back pocket that you could try, and if it did work, they\u2019d put it in the show. I liked the freedom, and Yvette afforded us that.\n\nFavorite episodes:\n\nTCC: The episode dealing with Kyle\u2019s hair because it showed how we do each other, because the bosses didn\u2019t have a problem with my hair, but the brother that I worked with did. When I got to sing \u201cMy Funny Valentine\u201d and \u201cA Rage in Harlem,\u201d when we went back to the jazz club days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJH: The Thanksgiving episode with Heavy D; that was one of my favorites. And the holiday shows: Overton with the pink Santa Claus suit that shrunk.\n\n\n\nKC: \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d when Synclaire wanted to audition for a theater group and they were not taking any more women, so she dressed up as a man. I loved the sideburns; I looked like Sinbad. It was a really funny episode and really fun to play, to dress up as a dude. They had to bind my breasts, and what\u2019s funny is that my breast wouldn\u2019t stay down. [Laughs.]\n\n\n\nEA: When we went back in time in the \u201950s and they were like the Supremes, and Khadijah stole Max\u2019s position as the lead singer in the group, and when T.C. sang \u201cMy Funny Valentine.\u201d Every time they dealt with music, I liked it \u2019cause T.C. usually sings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYLB: I loved the 100th episode, where we flashbacked to how they all came to live together when Synclaire moved to New York. Max, Regine and Khadijah had originally lived together, and they had this epic fight that led to Max moving across the street. That was a real [wish] fulfillment for me because when I conceived the show, originally, all four lived together. Then executive input caused me to make the decision to have Max live across the street to add some comedy to that. So I always wanted to come back and revisit the original concept that Max had lived with them.\n\nTheir thoughts on possibly revisiting the characters in a reboot:\n\nTCC: It would be a great opportunity to be able to tell the story of what\u2019s going on right now and how we are a resilient people, even through the things that are going on in this country. The love that we have for each other, the love that we have for our culture and our friends, is still stronger than the hate that somebody has for us. As long as we didn\u2019t go back, as long as we\u2019re moving forward with these people\u2014who these people are at this stage\u2014it would be great. I would love working with my friends again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKC: I\u2019m sure that Synclaire and Overton are still together and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still happy, and I\u2019m sure that Synclaire has grown into the woman she\u2019s supposed to be. She\u2019s still awkward, yummy, goofy and loving life. If it happens, I would absolutely embrace it.\n\n\n\nJH: Did they have their twins Syncloverton and Overclaire? I would imagine that they\u2019re still together and they\u2019ve got kids in college by now. It\u2019ll be a different dynamic, but they would still be a great couple. Just still in love and still having fun \u2019cause that\u2019s just the way they are. I did a comedy show with Kim Coles, and we just talked about so much, and anytime we have a chance to get together, we just have so much fun.\n\n\n\nEA: I can only imagine that a character like her, if her core is to be an individual and be strong, maybe she is in something that is totally against her being a lawyer. Totally in something with her being in constant with who she is, and her trying to walk through it. I don\u2019t know what that is exactly, but I\u2019d definitely put her in the hot seat. I think that\u2019s what happens in your 40s. All the confidence you once had you start to lack. Sometimes you lose your way a bit. It would be interesting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYLB: I haven\u2019t been able to go into that kind of detail \u2019cause that could be telling you what\u2019s in my head. I will tell you that anything is possible \u2019cause these characters are always alive in my mind. They live inside of me, so I\u2019ll just say that. [Laughs.]\n\n\n\nAshley G.

I\u2019m talking, my whole atmosphere is an allergen at times. I watch movies differently since I\u2019ve become a dad. I see commercials differently. When I\u2019m out and I see a little girl holding her dad\u2019s hand, I unintentionally smile as she looks at him like a hero. She has no idea what struggles he\u2019s facing; she just knows that dad is a hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStuff like that gets me. All. The. Time. My thug has been disposed of and replaced with a heart. I think kids do expose you to a different side of who you are\u2014the better side. Even the roughest dude usually has a very, very soft spot for his children. I\u2019m no different.\n\nRalph Angel (played by Kofi Siriboe) is the father of a little boy named Blue (Ethan Hutchinson). Since getting out of jail, Ralph Angel, for all his faults, has made sure to make his son the center of his universe. He provides for him the best he can and does all for him, including some temporary lapses in judgment. Thank God for Aunt Vi (Tina Lifford). Ralph Angel has pent-up anger at Blue\u2019s mother for being unable to care for her own son while he was down because she chose drugs over her child, and now even she is trying.\n\nPoint is, Ralph Angel is a father who wants nothing more than to be a great father to his son. There\u2019s just one problem: When he went to jail, guardianship of his son went to his aunt, Vi, who is not ready to give Ralph Angel that responsibility back. Ralph Angel has both implicitly and directly asked Aunt Vi to allow him to regain his legal guardianship of his son. It\u2019s a running theme through the show, but it hit home especially hard in episode 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlue\u2019s class is preparing to take a trip to the zoo. Ralph Angel signs a permission slip so that he can go. The next day, the teacher asks Ralph Angel to stop by so that she can talk to him.\n\nYou probably see where this is going.\n\nShe informs Ralph Angel that because he is not Blue\u2019s legal guardian, the school needs Aunt Vi to sign the slip. Ralph Angel retorts that he is Blue\u2019s father; but legally, that\u2019s irrelevant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruh.\n\nAll the allergies.\n\nI don\u2019t even have that problem in life, but again, seeing this dad, who is trying, realize that he can\u2019t even grant permission for his son to go to the zoo hit me where it hurts. I felt for him. I wanted to hug him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this same episode, Aunt Vi points out to Charley (Dawn-Lyen Gardner) that her soon-to-be ex-husband has a right to know what\u2019s going on in his son\u2019s life despite how horrible a person he is because everybody deserves a second chance. This resonates with Ralph Angel because despite the best efforts of mice and men, Aunt Vi doesn\u2019t think that he, who is actively working and providing for Blue, is ready to be the guardian of his own son.\n\nThis sets up a scene where Ralph Angel asks Vi to sign the permission slip, which she gladly does, remarking how much Blue loves animals. Ralph Angel almost walks away but decides that he needs to let Aunt Vi know how it feels; that even though he\u2019s not in jail and has paid his debt to society, he\u2019s still not free. He does everything he is supposed to do but doesn\u2019t have the right to do something as simple as allow his son to go on a class trip to the zoo; a decision so small looms so large over his heart and mind.\n\nAll he wants is to be a parent. And with tears in his eyes, he\u2019s begging for his second chance, some mercy and a signature on a piece of paper that holds so much weight over his life. He pleads his case, and Aunt Vi balks initially, largely because she can\u2019t stand Blue\u2019s mama, who has come back into the picture, but she is also going through growth and realization in her life and realizes that it\u2019s time to let the reins go, while still offering to be a source of help and support, because it\u2019s OK to ask for help if you need it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir powerful embrace almost did me in. It wasn\u2019t a hug of thanks, but of relief. It was Aunt Vi seeing him not for his mistakes but for who he is trying his best to be and what he wants to be for his son.\n\nThat entire scene illustrated why I love this show so much. It was real. It was acted well, but the sentiment was real. The struggle was present and not unfamiliar to many of us in our community. Something as small as a trip to the zoo emotionally triggered the struggle this man faces daily in attempts to get out from under the thumb of the system.\n\nScenes like that, with the smallest attention to detail, are why Queen Sugar is such a good show. The writing and directing are phenomenal, the cinematography is awesome. And the cast pulls it off. This particular struggle is Ralph Angel\u2019s, but Nova (Rutina Wesley) and Charley are fighting battles and facing demons all the same while the family tries to keep up the good fight. Queen Sugar tells a million stories, and one of them is probably yours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re not watching Queen Sugar, you should be.

I, however, suspect that it had something to do with Trump giving him a shoutout on Twitter.\n\nDiddy clocked in at No. 2 with $825 million.

After all, we did see the Shaft reboot, which, for some odd reason, is getting yet another reboot.\n\n\n\nStill, given the boom of white-led revivals and reboots in recent years, it\u2019s about time that black shows cash in on nostalgia and Hollywood\u2019s total disinterest in original ideas. With that in mind, I\u2019ll be playing the role of fake-ass development executive and outlining potential reboots of previous Negro-focused programming of yore. If you hate me playing the role of melanin-enriched Andy Cohen, that\u2019s fine, but remember this, beloveds: This shit still sounds better than a second Shaft reboot.

They leave white people\u2014and, thus, most of their troubles\u2014behind in a new world they build from scratch.

Brandy herself was asked about this and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, and I feel so bad because, you know, so many of the fans, they\u2019re mad about that.

As for who was pregnant, it was Niecy, and she takes a more prominent role in the show.\n\n\n\nNow, with respect to Kim Parker, she fell off with both of them, got colored contacts and a terrible wig and ended up a sad reality star.

He then called the defendants up to his bench and told them he'd dismiss their charges in exchange for \"community service.\" Boeckmann allegedly gave defendants his personal phone number and told them to call it to arrange the terms of the \"services,\" authorities said.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the \"community service\" involved collecting aluminum cans or litter and bringing them to Boeckmann's house, where he then took photos of the defendants in \"compromising positions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one incident, Boeckmann allegedly offered to throw out a defendant's charges if he performed labor at the judge's house. He then told that same defendant, who was facing several traffic citations and charges for misdemeanor crimes over a four-year period, that he would dismiss the case if he let Boeckmann take photos of him naked while masturbating or being spanked, authorities charged.\n\nAccording to the Post, Boeckmann has been charged with eight counts of wire fraud for allegedly dismissing fines, fees and court costs that the defendants were meant to pay, as well as covering up his conduct by falsifying court records and trying to threaten and bribe witnesses.\n\nBoeckmann was being held in the Pulaski County Detention Center, according to a jail roster, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lawyer for the Justice Department, Jonathan Kravis, said during Monday's arraignment hearing that one of the defendants told prosecutors that Boeckmann ordered another individual to offer the witness money to recant his testimony, and that the witness was told that he could \"disappear\" if he didn't.\n\nAccording to the report, Boeckmann's indictment follows a monthslong investigation by the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disciplinary Commission, which announced the judge's permanent removal in May. Boeckmann promised never to seek employment in government\u2014local, county or state\u2014in a resignation letter, authorities said.\n\nThe disciplinary commission found that Boeckmann had a history of offering \"community service\" options to young, male defendants and their relatives. He is also accused of reducing the $50,000 bond of a woman named Crystal Avellino, who was charged with theft and abuse of an endangered or impaired person.

It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

I imagine they were sitting in the studio listening to it and Questlove was like, \u201cI can\u2019t just listen to this for a minute and a half; I need this to last for at least five minutes.\u201d\n\nI could listen to it for 10. And then to infinity and beyond. Listen, I don\u2019t know what God\u2019s favorite song or album of all time is. I\u2019d imagine God has a pretty varied musical palate. But I\u2019d be willing to bet all of the money in my bank account that this song is on his \u201cBest of Humans\u201d playlist.\n\n\n\nLyrically, we have pre-Hollywood-fame Common where he was still spitting with hunger with a continuation of the same observant theme from 1994\u2019s classic ode to hip-hop, \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d Common dropped his famous \u201cwhen we perform it\u2019s just coffee shop chicks and white dudes\u201d line and sent a few shots at Hype Williams and Puffy for turning hip-hop into commercial garbage (his opinion, not mine) with the shiny-suit era through their visuals and music, respectively. This was the Common we all knew and loved.\n\nOne of the knocks on Black Thought in all of the arguments about his GOAT status is that while he\u2019s clearly a top-tier lyricist, his verses are not memorable; most folks can\u2019t recite any lines or verses on instant recall. I\u2019ve made that argument. That\u2019s not the case on \u201cAct Too,\u201d for it\u2019s literally the only entire Black Thought verse I know from start to finish. When he opens up with \u201cThe anticipation arose as time froze, I stared off the stage with my eyes closed ... ,\u201d I can see it. It may help that the verse is short, checking in at waaaay less than 16 bars, but hey, the impact pushed back the first five rows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven almost 20 years later, \u201cAct Too\u201d still impresses me when I hear it. When I\u2019m in the car and I can\u2019t think of anything to listen to, and I\u2019ve already listened to Midnight Marauders on repeat, I always fall back on Things Fall Apart, specifically so I can listen to \u201cAct Too.\u201d It\u2019s one of those songs that I can absolutely say have added to my own life by virtue of their existence. There are certain moments where artists create works of art that are nothing short of blessings. \u201cAct Too\u201d is one of those works of art, helping to explain why hip-hop is now and always will be a love of my life.", "keywords": ["album", "song", "common", "act", "love", "black", "fall", "moments", "hiphop", "listen", "things", "roots", "history", "perfect", "music", "verses", "life"], "polarity": 0.21462818003913892, "subjectivity": 0.45669710806697117},

The Philadelphia Inquirer was the first to report on the existence of the list, which was compiled under former DA Seth Williams. He is currently in jail, serving a corruption sentence.\n\nMeek\u2019s lawyers believe that this is enough grounds to overturn the rapper\u2019s initial conviction on gun and drug charges, which was largely based on the account of Officer Reginald V. Graham, the arresting officer who appeared on the DA list. Graham testified against Meek in court, saying that police informants saw Meek, who was 18 at the time, selling crack cocaine on the streets.\n\nMeek, however, says that at the time informants supposedly saw him selling drugs, he was actually in court supporting his cousin\u2014a fact his lawyers say is easily provable and wasn\u2019t even considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rapper also says that he was brutally beaten by four officers upon his arrest.

With over two decades in the trenches, Torres, who founded Wax Poetics magazine and was also executive editor at the lyrics site Genius, is now vice president of the urban catalog at Universal Music Enterprises. And in his new role, he\u2019s launched Universal Music\u2019s latest imprint, Urban Legends.\n\n\n\nUrban Legends can be described as a repository or catalog of all things hip-hop from Universal Music. The site will celebrate anniversaries of some hip-hop classics, as well as provide its audience with new and inventive ways to interact with the music and its artists. In an interview with The Root, Torres discusses his goals for the site, as well as his own vinyl loves.\n\nThe Root: How did the Urban Legends imprint concept come about?\n\nAndre Torres: I come from media, having run my own magazine and running the Spotify collaboration at Genius. When I got this position, I was looking at how things were being marketed and how hip-hop was dominating on music streaming services, but obviously there\u2019s no liner notes there, or some of the things I grew up with.\n\nI also knew younger people are now into collecting vinyl and obsessing over stuff. I figured it was good to start with one central location where we can bring everything together\u2014whether it\u2019s content, exclusive-material drops or all of our releases\u2014and act as a hub for Universal Music Group. It\u2019s urban music, going back decades. I think a lot of what people are listening to, catalogwise, there\u2019s a way to tie all of that together, and Urban Legends is the perfect destination for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: How has the site been received so far?\n\nAT: It\u2019s been great. We had a soft launch before the holidays and did a redesign a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019ve been getting a good response. I\u2019ve brought in Lauren Nostro, who I knew at Genius, and Tyrine Howard, who was at Fake Shore Drive, who\u2019s running social. We come from the music-media world, and I don\u2019t see us as competition from other music sites; they\u2019re our \u201chomies.\u201d We\u2019re going to them saying, \u201cYo, you love this record, why don\u2019t you come here and write about it?\u201d It\u2019s really a spot for fans. We\u2019re finding our niche and what works well for us, and discovering what is possible out here.\n\nTR: With your own background within music, how has the landscape changed since you started in music journalism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: It\u2019s like night and day. Being in print media in the early 2000s, it was a much different game. The label system was stronger, there was a lot of indie labels. This was preweb. Once the internet became a huge part of music culture, its effect on the way people consumed music, it had a drastic effect on what content was being made around music and how people\u2019s attention spans were shifting.\n\nLabels, much like media companies who were focused in music, have been scrambling and trying to figure out what works. It\u2019s a process, because what worked two years ago doesn\u2019t even now. The Facebook algorithm switches so quickly, you have no other choice but to take it day by day. People are hungry for content, context and discovery, and whether you\u2019re talking about preinternet and now, a lot of that hasn\u2019t changed. There\u2019s a lot of freedom artists have now, and kids are free to express themselves in ways we haven\u2019t seen.\n\nTR: With Universal, who\u2019s had everyone from Tupac to Dr. Dre, what do you think their legacy is when it comes to hip-hop music?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: Looking at Universal with all of its tentacles globally, it\u2019s the biggest record label in the world. When I was looking into what this position means, and the material I\u2019d have my hands on, it was hard to argue with, because you\u2019re talking everything from Pac to Dre. From Def Jam to Motown. There\u2019s huge catalogs. There\u2019s a wealth of material at Universal.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve been there from the beginning of hip-hop, and this company has been committed to urban music from its inception. And them bringing me over proves how much more of a commitment the company has, and understands the importance of urban music.\n\nTR: Everyone who knows you knows you\u2019re a vinyl head. As a vinyl head, what\u2019s your favorite record?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: I own thousands and thousands of records. That\u2019s one of the hardest questions that you could ask me. One record that always pops up in my head is\u2014and it\u2019s revolutionary for me\u2014is 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul. Also, James Brown\u2019s The Popcorn record is revolutionary for me. It\u2019s difficult to name just one.\n\nTR: What do you think people are missing from not having a vinyl experience?\n\nAT: I think there\u2019s always been a sort of tactile part of music listening. It\u2019s always been that physical element. This younger generation is kind of the first that doesn\u2019t have that. But even with streaming music becoming a No. 1 genre, vinyl sales are still up year after year. And the No. 1 vinyl retailer is Urban Outfitters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYounger people are now looking for that tactile moment. Even though people have everything on their phone, people still want to be able to have something to show people what they love. And vinyl allows that. Kids are luckier nowadays because they have many more options and have the best of both worlds.\n\nTR: Where do you see Urban Legends in a year?\n\nAT: I want to build a strong community of super-hardcore fans of urban music. I want people to experience the catalog and making of these records with anniversaries of music. And how younger artists are influenced by our history of music, as well as physical products we\u2019ll be releasing this year. It\u2019ll put Urban Legends in a different light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not trying to do what has been traditionally done in a catalog space. We have great anniversaries this year, from Black Star to Slick Rick\u2019s Great Adventures. This year will be big on the content and product side. As we keep the momentum going, people will clearly understand that the site is where it\u2019s at. Hip-hop\u2019s catalog is dominating, and Urban Legends is positioned to do that better than everyone else.\n\nTo learn more about Urban Legends, visit its site.\n\n", "keywords": ["legends", "theres", "musics", "vp", "vinyl", "urban", "hiphop", "talks", "platform", "catalog", "torres", "site", "universal", "music", "editorial"], "polarity": 0.1860886959482465, "subjectivity": 0.39524125687047035},

It is a stereotype that is deeply embedded in our nation\u2019s history. It\u2019s something that we fight against every day. The place where that stereotype does its most damage is in the criminal-justice system,\" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told a group of reporters at a press briefing in Washington, D.C., last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIfill was referring to Buck, who has been, quite literally, sentenced to death because of his race. His case, in a sense, starkly relates to the context of the national conversation surrounding the systemic killing of black men.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is scheduled to hear oral arguments in Buck\u2019s case (Buck v. Davis) on Wednesday. Justices will have the opportunity to decide whether or not Buck\u2019s sentencing\u2014tainted by blatant racial bias\u2014meets the criteria to warrant a reopening of judgment and thus set him up for new and fair sentencing.\n\nThe series of gross injustices against Buck started in 1997 during the sentencing phase of his trial. He was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend and another man. That is not up for question. He is guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, during the sentencing phase of his trial, his own defense team inexplicably called on \u201cexpert\u201d witness Dr. Walter Qujiano, who testified that Buck was more likely to commit future acts of violence because he is black.\n\nThis point is important because in the state of Texas, the death sentence is only an option if the jury finds unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual would continue to commit acts of violence.\n\nWhen Buck\u2019s defense team introduced the bogus, racist testimony, it freed up room for the prosecution to repeat the testimony during cross-examination, which prosecutors did, urging the jury to consider the \u201cevidence.\u201d After two days of grueling deliberation, the jury decided to sentence Buck to death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe horror did not stop there. Buck tried to challenge his sentencing in a state habeas corpus proceeding, which is kind of like an appellate proceeding, and for which he got new, court-appointed counsel. That counsel, however, was not any more effective than his first round of lawyers, Buck's current attorneys say, making no mention of Quijano\u2019s problematic testimony or the ineffective assistance of trial counsel with which Buck grappled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2002 that the issue was even brought up, but by then, under Texas law, it was too late, with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal stating that it did not have to consider the problematic testimony that resulted in Buck\u2019s death sentence because the matter was not raised in the proper way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround that time, however, Buck did see a ray of hope. In 2000, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, who is now a U.S. senator, acknowledged the pattern of racist testimony by Quijano and announced an audit of six cases, including Buck\u2019s, which were tainted because of similar testimony and thus required new sentencing.\n\nTexas promised to correct the errors and did so in all of the cases \u2026 except for Buck\u2019s. Cornyn\u2019s successor, Greg Abbott, who is now the governor of Texas, did not follow through on the original promise in Buck\u2019s case.\n\nYears later, in 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a pair of rulings that stated that inmate claims that were \u201cprocedurally defaulted\u201d because of ineffective counsel could be heard in federal court. Thus, the mistake of Buck\u2019s second attorney would no longer prevent him from challenging the inadequacy of his first team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuck filed the motion to reopen the prior federal court decision, but the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that Buck\u2019s case was not \u201cextraordinary\u201d enough to warrant reopening the judgment, denying Buck permission to appeal the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit followed up by also denying permission.\n\nLuckily, the Supreme Court in June of this year granted Buck\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. A writ of certiorari orders a lower court to deliver its record in a case so that the higher court may review it. The Supreme Court uses certiorari to pick most of the cases it hears. And that is where his case stands now.\n\n\u201cIf this is not an extraordinary case, there is no such thing as an extraordinary case,\" one of Buck\u2019s attorney\u2019s, Sam Spital of Holland & Knight, told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You have such a combination of extraordinary circumstances demonstrating the ultimate injustice, not only to Buck, but the ultimate harm to the integrity of the courts and to the integrity of our democracy,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, 19 out of Buck\u2019s 20 years of incarceration have been spent on death row. What makes Buck\u2019s case even more remarkable, another attorney, Kate Black with the Texas Defender Service, said, is that in those 20 years of imprisonment, Buck has had not a single disciplinary infraction.\n\n\u201cHe has a spotless disciplinary record, and that\u2019s really remarkable. On death row, inmates are routinely written up for trivial things like refusing to shave, having too many postage stamps, putting pictures of art or photos on the wall or windows, refusing to shower on a given day,\u201d Black told reporters. \u201cI think [this] speaks to how problematic Dr. Quijano\u2019s testimony was, not only legally, but it was false. It turned out that it was an incorrect prediction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuck, now 52, is a man who is deeply grounded in Christianity, spending his time in prison ministering to the young inmates and teaching them about remorse, reflection and redemption, Black said.\n\nBecause of Buck\u2019s own remorse, the surviving victim of his 1995 attack, Phyllis Taylor, has forgiven him and joined with the multiple voices who have asked for a new, fair, colorblind sentencing, Black said. Other voices of support for new sentencing include former Harris County, Texas, Assistant District Attorney Linda Geffin, the prosecutor in Buck\u2019s capital-murder case; former Texas Gov. Mark White, who oversaw more than 19 executions; and more than 100 civil rights leaders, elected officials, clergy, former prosecutors and judges, as well as others.\n\n\u201cI think essentially the point is that people of all political persuasions, faiths, racial and ethnic backgrounds have come together out of a great concern,\u201d Black said. \u201cThey are united in their belief that in this country, one of our fundamental principles must be protected, and that principle is that race play[s] no role in our criminal-justice system, particularly when the ultimate punishment is at stake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreanna Edwards is news editor at The Root.

{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/beyond-the-talk-how-i-plan-to-address-police-violenc-1823716888", "title": "/beyond-the-talk-how-i-plan-to-address-police-violenc-", "text": "Photo: Andrew Burton (Getty Images)\n\nMy son is only 5 years old and we\u2019ve already had \u201cthe talk.\u201d I can recall being a little older when my grandfather, a probation officer, had the same talk with me. It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

I can\u2019t. You just have to watch it. I\u2019m literally too flabbergasted to do so. And I don\u2019t get flabbergasted often, but this video ... good gotdamn. Watching white folks whitefolkin\u2019 is something we\u2019re all used to by this point, but Meek Mill could not envision the levels of white to which these motherfuckers have achieved in this video. We\u2019re talking secret levels in \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d white. We\u2019re talking sniffin\u2019 cocaine on a white linen tablecloth wearing white tube socks in a snowstorm while eating cauliflower with salt in the North Pole.\n\nThis video is what I imagine happens in white living rooms at every holiday and while watching Fox News on a daily basis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese white people don\u2019t believe that any of the women who allege Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with them are telling the truth. These white people think that African Americans are stupid for voting against what they say are their best interests, which would be conservative policies and Republicans\u2014even (alleged) pedophiles.\n\nThese white people think that Roy Moore is not guilty, but I\u2019ll bet they think Colin Kaepernick is what\u2019s wrong with America. These white people believe that Roy Moore is innocent until proved guilty, though I\u2019m pretty sure that all of them think Trayvon Martin was guilty of something.\n\nThese white people think all the women are being paid to claim that Roy Moore engaged with them inappropriately. These white people think that race relations in Alabama were fine until Barack Obama showed up. These people think Alabama doesn\u2019t really have a race problem anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese white people think that sinful Roy Moore probably repented, so it\u2019s OK. These white people think that Alabama in 1977 was a place where you married 13-year-olds and maybe Roy Moore was just a victim of his time. These white people think there are a lot of mamas and daddies who would be thrilled that a district attorney was hitting on their 14-year-old.\n\nThese white people are who you think of when you think of the state of Alabama, because these white people think that Roy Moore has integrity. These white people think Bill Clinton was a womanizer because somebody filed a claim and if a court case isn\u2019t filed, you must not be a womanizer. These white people think that immigrants are taking black folks\u2019 jobs.\n\nThese white people are an embarrassment to the state of Alabama. These white people are also indicative of the state of Alabama. These white people are why Alabama is about to embarrass itself and possibly end up with a man who, if he were in Congress right now, would get kicked out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI read an article talking about folks in Alabama\u2014in particular current Sen. Richard Shelby\u2014worried about the reputation of the state if Roy Moore is elected. And everybody who feels that way is right. The potential election of this man to national office points quite clearly to the fact that enough people in the state are fucking idiots who are willing to cut off their noses to spite their faces.\n\nFor those of us with even a modicum of decency who are from Alabama or who have lived in Alabama, we\u2019re all watching this hoping for the best while realizing that this video represents our neighbors, co-workers and, in some cases, family members. Individuals are smart, people are dumb. And this video, unfortunately, is representative of far more dumbass people than are participating in it.\n\nThe people in this video are the enemy of progress. These are regular ol\u2019 Alabama white people. The state motto is \u201cWe dare to defend our rights.\u201d Well, sometimes that means defending the right to be dumb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese white people aren\u2019t all of Alabama, but they\u2019re Alabama.\n\nAlabama the beaut ... never mind.", "keywords": ["insane", "thing", "roy", "sticking", "white", "watching", "week", "talking", "think", "happened", "video", "moore", "right", "alabama", "state", "whitest"], "polarity": 0.0578937728937729, "subjectivity": 0.36844838921762},
{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/how-do-you-listen-to-hip-hop-1822763759", "title": "/how-do-you-listen-to-hip-hop-", "text": "On Feb. 2, 2018, Brooklyn, N.Y., wordsmith Skyzoo released an album called In Celebration of Us. I don\u2019t know exactly how I decided to listen to it\u2014I can\u2019t call myself a Skyzoo fan\u2014but since I did, it\u2019s been in heavy rotation. Skyzoo, as any hip-hop head will tell you, is a noted lyricist in the \u201990s tradition. He\u2019s got solid wordplay, substance, weaves in and out of bars effortlessly, rides the beats well\u2014basically everything you could ask for in a lyricist you get in Skyzoo.\n\nAnd until now, I\u2019ve never made it through an entire project of his. I\u2019m aware of them all. Because I\u2019m a hip-hop head, every time one of his projects drops, somebody asks me for my opinion on it. And I almost always give the same response: It\u2019s cool, but not really my bag. Put a pin in this.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that I\u2019m a meat-and-potatoes guy about my hip-hop. What that means is this: If the production isn\u2019t good or if you\u2019re not a good performer of the art, I don\u2019t care how good a lyricist you are; I can\u2019t critically consume it. Shit, I can barely listen to what you have to say. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always struggled with Lupe Fiasco and even Black Thought\u2014two of the best lyricists to ever do it, but I\u2019m not invested in their catalogs, though I love the Roots for what they do, and they are responsible for some of my favorite hip-hop creations: specifically, \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life),\u201d which is EASILY one of the best pieces of music, regardless of genre, ever composed.\n\nMy favorite rapper is Jay-Z. My favorite hip-hop album has long been De La Soul\u2019s De La Soul Is Dead, but I think I might have to change that to A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Midnight Marauders. N.W.A.\u2014in all of their problematic glory\u2014have long been my favorite rap group, though Outkast is right in there at 1a. As you can see, my tendencies skew toward the \u201990s. My top five will almost always feature Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000 and Ice Cube the Rapper before he died in the early \u201990s and was reborn as Ice Cube the Guy Gettin\u2019 Those Checks.\n\n\n\nIn that same vein, I also do think that Tupac is one of the greatest to ever do it. Was he one of the best technical rappers ever? No. Best lyricists ever? No. But did he perform rap on record better than almost anybody else? Absolutely. Tupac made you feel what he was saying in ways that folks like Scarface and Ice Cube did, though Cube\u2019s pen game was clearly on a hundred, thousand, trillion. Tupac, though, wasn\u2019t a bad rapper at all. He had tremendous skill and was better at maximizing his strengths than almost any other rapper. But his performance on the microphone stands out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite rap song is Pete Rock and CL Smooth\u2019s \u201cThey Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),\u201d which for my money is the best rap song ever created. Which is interesting because CL Smooth would make not ONE single person\u2019s list\u2014outside of his family\u2019s\u2014of top 10, 20, even top 50 best rappers to ever do it. In fact, the only reason most of us know CL Smooth is because of the production he rapped over.\n\nIf Pete Rock weren\u2019t one of the greatest producers of all time, CL Smooth would be any other rapper from New York whose time came and went. And he\u2019s not a terrible rapper; he\u2019s just not great, either. Yet I know entire CL Smooth verses, and he sounded perfect over Pete\u2019s production. His voice is distinct and powerful. The marriage of the two artists made some of the best hip-hop of the \u201990s. So much so that I\u2019m super pissed that their album The Main Ingredient is unavailable on streaming services. Somebody needs to make a call.\n\nDespite the fact that I name-checked De La Soul Is Dead and Midnight Marauders (and honestly, you could throw Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic, Ice Cube\u2019s Death Certificate and Jay-Z\u2019s Reasonable Doubt in there to round out my top five), DJ Shadow\u2019s Endtroducing... (1996), RJD2\u2019s Deadringer (2002) and Dilla\u2019s Donuts (2006) are the three albums that resonate most deeply with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most telling part is that they\u2019re almost entirely instrumental hip-hop albums. RJD2\u2019s \u201cJune\u201d is particularly compelling as a piece of work. But they\u2019re producer-showcase albums where Shadow, RJD2 and Dilla spread their wings and do their things. DJ Shadow\u2019s song \u201cBuilding Steam With a Grain of Salt\u201d changed all kinds of shit for me. It even influenced the way I approached production and my own attempts at hip-hop artistry to this day.\n\nBut that highlights my struggle: Without a solid backing of music, it is very difficult for me to dig into what\u2019s being presented vocally, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re a super technically proficient rapper who just happens to have a fairly droning voice. It\u2019s the Nas paradox\u2014one of the greatest to ever do it, top five dead or alive, known for trash beat selection, but he gets a pass because he\u2019s Nas and released Illmatic. Because of Illmatic (and to a lesser extent It Was Written), I have to listen to people tell me that even though his beats suck often, I should push past because the God MC is spitting that knowledge. Which, yeah, not always, boo.\n\nThis brings me back to Skyzoo, an artist I\u2019ve never listened to that heavily. After In Celebration of Us came out, because of how much I loved it, I had to ask myself what went wrong. I\u2019m aware of Skyzoo and have listened to his projects in parts, so what gives? I revisited several of his projects, and the same problem always resurfaced\u2014I didn\u2019t love the beat selection, even though I can hear the skill. None of it is bad; it just fades into the beats and background at times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I think he\u2019s got a very, very solid understanding of what works best for him. But most of it didn\u2019t draw me in because unlike rappers like Tupac or Ludacris or Scarface, whose voices and lyrical performances are super instrumental in their craftsmanship, he gets lost.\n\nMeanwhile, when I first pulled up \u201cEverything\u2019s Fine\u201d on In Celebration of Us, I INSTANTLY got invested when he started spitting. I was and am able to dig into the project because he picked some awesome beats to supplement his lyricism, even if he was the same solid Skyzoo he\u2019s always been, drawing it to the top of the beat for the first time in my listening experience.\n\nHell, it\u2019s the very reason that so many people from the \u201990s are familiar with and swear by Group Home\u2019s Livin\u2019 Proof album, and with all due respect, there\u2019s no reason to ever know Lil Dap or Melachi the Nutcracker. Melachi is so bad, he had Dap sounding like Nas. DJ Premier\u2019s production was SO good on that album that I can listen to it despite lyrics like this:\n\nYo, I rock on the block with the real hip-hop/As you start to clock ... and jock/Yo, I\u2019m coming off with mad rage/Eighteen, and hitting the real stage/But don\u2019t worry \u2019bout me, \u2019cause I\u2019m making it/And if I can\u2019t have it, then I\u2019m taking it/That\u2019s how it is, \u2019cause I\u2019m living trife/Where\u2019s my knife? Take a chance with your life/Rappers decapitate, and disintegrate/You I will mutilate, when I penetrate/Go for the one when I say raid/A hitman for hire and I wanna get paid/\u2019Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid/More money is made and that\u2019s the family trade/See, I make moves and tell what\u2019s the truth/That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to be living proof\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s Melachi\u2019s verse on the title track, \u201cLivin\u2019 Proof.\u201d Where\u2019s Offset when you need him? And if you think that verse is better than any verse any Migo(s) has spit, you should stick a quarter in your ass \u2019cause you played yourself.\n\nSkyzoo has always been a great rapper like Royce, Elzhi, etc. Always. And after revisiting previous projects, this album had the music that resonated the most with me. It only helps that the execution of the project is top-notch.\n\nI acknowledge that lyrics are the bedrock of rap music, so ultimately as a fan and consumer, I try my best to dig into the lyricism, but when you\u2019re largely a rapper\u2019s rapper, it\u2019s easy to get lost on a record. I can understand people who are able to focus on lyrics over bad beats for the sake of artistry. But songs are not just lyrics; songs are beats and rhymes. And I need the beats and performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m too big a fan of music to ignore a less-than-decent beat for the sake of some extremely talented lyricism. My mind is not set up that way. I want to feel what\u2019s happening, and the beats are often the entryway. And to be fair, it\u2019s why Tupac was a hard sell for many until Me Against the World. All Eyez on Me and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory both have extremely solid production and are therefore much easier to consume and digest because Tupac performed the hell out of his records.\n\nThink about this: One of the big controversies Drake was involved in was that on his album If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, he had writers. Quentin Miller is credited for several of the records, and reference vocal tracks surfaced with him performing the songs word for word. And they sucked. He sucked on them. Drake takes the same shit, Drakes them with the exact same words, and all of a sudden you have hits. The performance makes all the difference. It\u2019s indisputable. For me, performance and production are how I listen to hip-hop. Lyrics are important, but I can\u2019t just forgo the rest.\n\nHow do you listen to your hip-hop?", "keywords": ["im", "skyzoo", "album", "best", "hiphop", "rapper", "listen", "beats", "production", "tupac"], "polarity": 0.2334303142744702, "subjectivity": 0.5255721875527068},

Agitate! Agitate!\u201d was his reply.\n\n\n\nThis pioneer of civil rights lived long enough to die of a heart attack in his old age, a heroic feat in and of itself for a former slave. Douglass was born on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore 200 years ago today, Feb. 14, and it is my belief that he went on to become the greatest Marylander to ever live. His accomplishments would stand out in any era, but when put in the context of Douglass\u2019 having been a former slave, he was the epitome of what we call \u201cblack excellence\u201d today.\n\n\n\nDouglass was a banker, a lawyer, an abolitionist, an escaped slave, the most photographed American of the 19th century and a leader who would help hold America together as a civil war threatened to tear it apart.\n\n\n\nHe had the courage to stand up for women\u2019s rights, Native American rights and immigrant rights even as his own rights were still being denied.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Douglass attended the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, he was the only African American to do so. As collected members voiced opposition to female suffrage, he admonished them, saying, \u201cIn the denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that he would find himself unable to accept the right to vote as a black man if women could not also claim that right, tying the struggle for his right to vote to that of female suffrage, a unifying vision of universal suffrage rather than one that pitted two marginalized groups against each other.\n\n\n\nHe had the courage to stand up for women\u2019s rights, Native American rights and immigrant rights even as his own rights were still being denied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouglass also spoke out against the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was the first law to explicitly prevent a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the United States.\n\nIn opposition Douglass said:\n\nOur geographical position, our relation to the outside world, our fundamental principles of government, world-embracing in their scope and character, our vast resources, requiring all manner of labor to develop them, and our already existing composite population, all conspire to one grand end, and that is, to make us the perfect national illustration of the unity and dignity of the human family that the world has ever seen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we celebrate Douglass\u2019 200th birthday, his legacy endures in the faces of all those who continue to agitate, agitate, agitate in pursuit of a more just and fair America. Douglass\u2019 influence was in the actions of lawyers who flocked to American airports to help immigrants caught in President Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. We saw it in the marchers who descended upon Charlottesville, Va., to say no to the Ku Klux Klan, and in the voices of all those who participated in last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March to agitate against the election of a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women.\n\n\n\nThroughout my career as a civil rights leader and community organizer, I\u2019ve often thought of Douglass and tried to mirror his example. Essentially, at his core, Douglass was an organizer and a believer in building big, broad coalitions for change. I was fortunate enough to be named Marylander of the Year in 2012 because as president and CEO of the NAACP, I helped lead a historic effort to abolish the death penalty, achieve marriage equality and pass the Maryland DREAM Act all in one year. When skeptics doubted if immigrants, LGBT and civil rights groups could all come together and advance at once, I thought of Douglass\u2019 courage and worked to help fashion the type of coalition he described as \u201cthe perfect national illustration of the unity and dignity of the human family the world has ever seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis refusal to see opportunity and justice as a zero-sum game gives us a road map for every struggle for equality since. When we act as if only one group has the ability to gain power or that the success of other oppressed groups comes at the price of another, we allow ourselves to be pitted against those who would ally with us to ensure justice for all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day and in honor of his birthday, let\u2019s remember Douglass\u2019 advice to agitate in the face of injustice, and his courage in saying we are stronger when we act as one.\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

Robert Rihmeek Williams is a Philadelphia man who many believe has been wrongly incarcerated by an overzealous judge who is using her influence and judicial power to keep the man down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who believe that Williams is being wrongly incarcerated will be the first to tell you that he isn\u2019t a saint, but he\u2019s no Meek Mill.

Williams was charged with assault, drug and gun possession. He was tried in 2008, and in January 2009, he was sentenced to 11-23 months in jail by Commons Pleas Judge Brinkley, who commented that she wanted the rapper to \u201cturn his life around from selling drugs and instead focus on his musical talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams served just five months of his initial sentence and was released in 2009 and given house arrest, which ended later that year. He was also given five years\u2019 probation.\n\nEverything that has happened since\u2014all the news about his incarceration and run-ins with the judge\u2014stems from this incident from when he was just 18 years old. And here\u2019s the thing: Every time Williams commits another infraction, any infraction, the judge adds more probation time to his sentence, meaning that although Williams is a free man, he\u2019s still living in a prison state.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Williams would test positive for weed and opioids, which wasn\u2019t bad enough to warrant probation violations, but the incidents began to be straws that broke the judge\u2019s back. In 2012, after Williams missed a couple of court dates, the judge ruled that because Williams couldn\u2019t make it to court, maybe he shouldn\u2019t be trusted with travel.\n\nThis appears to be the point when the relationship between Brinkley and Williams soured.\n\nAfter stating that there was nothing more important than appearing in her courtroom, the judge determined that Williams shouldn\u2019t be traveling if he couldn\u2019t make his court appearances. Williams\u2019 lawyer Joe Tacopina argued that as the rapper\u2019s success continued to rise, his schedule became more demanding. But Brinkley wasn\u2019t having it; she banned the star from going on the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how Billboard describes Williams\u2019 ascent and perpetual downfall in 2014:\n\n\n\nAfter his prison release, Meek Mill made it his duty to take his music seriously, which worked out in his favor as the rapper signed with Rick Ross\u2019 Maybach Music Group label in 2011. Meek showed promise with the release of his breakout track \u201cI\u2019m a Boss\u201d and his star continued to rise since as his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite all his success, the Philly native landed right back in courts in 2014 for violating his probation by booking performances outside of Philly without Judge Brinkley\u2019s approval. The rapper was sentenced to three to six months in jail. Meek began his stint in July and was released from prison in December 2014. He was put on parole and ordered to complete etiquette classes.\n\nEtiquette classes? Why?\n\nIt was \u201c(i)n order to address his inappropriate social media use and crude language in the courtroom,\u201d Brinkley wrote in court papers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently the judge wasn\u2019t keen on the rapper using foul language on social media, so she decided she was going to do something about it, and that something was etiquette classes.\n\n\u201cMultiple Philadelphia lawyers told [music website] Pitchfork they had never heard of a judge ordering a defendant to take etiquette classes, though they noted that for better or worse, judges\u2019 sentences are sometimes creative. For the next year, Meek attended court hearings every three months,\u201d Pitchfork reports.\n\nMost important, though, he was given an additional five years of probation.\n\nIn 2016, Williams would have several small infractions, including failing to meet with his probation officer and submitting cold water instead of urine during a drug test. The biggest infraction, and the one that really seemed to bother the judge, was that Williams again had traveled without her consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only problem with this is that if Williams, as a rapper, can\u2019t travel and perform songs while they\u2019re hot, how can he make money? Saying that a rapper can work but he can\u2019t leave his home state is like saying that I can write whatever I want, but I can\u2019t use a computer, pen, paper or phone.\n\n\n\nFor this infraction, he was given six to 12 months of house arrest, but the real injustice here is that he was given another six years of probation. Which means that Williams would have to appear before this judge for an additional six years, hoping that he wasn\u2019t thrown back in prison for the most minor misstep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, in 2017, Williams had two small infractions, and these are the crux of Brinkley\u2019s reasoning for sending Williams back to jail.\n\nAt an airport in St. Louis, an employee wanted to take a photo with Williams, who refused, resulting in one of Williams\u2019 entourage and the airport employee getting into a scuffle. Williams said that he was trying to break up the fight, but he was charged with misdemeanor assault. The assault charge was eventually dropped, but it was still cited in the judge\u2019s reasoning for why he should go back to jail.\n\n\n\nAfter the airport fight, Williams was in New York City to perform his aptly tilted song \u201cYBA (Young Black America)\u201d from his album Wins & Losses on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. The night before the performance, Williams and friends drove dirt bikes around Manhattan, during which, police witnessed Williams popping a wheelie. Williams was not arrested. In fact, he didn\u2019t get arrested until video of the infamous wheelie went viral on social media. Police then charged him with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA guy literally popped a wheelie for 10 seconds on the street with no one else around,\u201d Tacopina said in a video posted by TMZ. \u201cAnd the police were there. That\u2019s very important. The police were there, and they saw it, and they didn\u2019t arrest him. They didn\u2019t even give him a traffic ticket, but somehow the video made it to social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Meek accepted a plea deal that removes the charge from his record under the condition that he stay out of trouble for six months and complete community service.\n\nWhile all of these are probation violations, they are also the smallest of infractions that continue to have Williams in a perpetual prisoner state. Keep in mind that Williams is almost 30 years old, and because of his violations, he is still on probation from a case stemming from 2007!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if all of this isn\u2019t bizarre enough, let\u2019s also add that the judge in his case allegedly asked the rapper to remake the Boyz II Men love ballad \u201cOn Bended Knee\u201d and to name-drop the judge!\n\nWilliams\u2019 lawyers also say that she asked the rapper to leave Roc Nation management and sign with a friend of hers who they say has a checkered past. And the judge allegedly appeared at one of Williams\u2019 community service assignments to see if he was really there. The judge is now reportedly being investigated by the FBI for the way in which she\u2019s handled Williams\u2019 case.\n\nThe whole thing has been absurd.\n\nIn truth, the only person who seems to want to ensure that Williams stays in prison is the judge. In fact, during his last hearing before her court, not one person\u2014not the prosecutors, not the police, no one\u2014wanted him imprisoned for violations that didn\u2019t even amount to actual charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we see in the Meek Mill case is someone who can go to jail for a lengthy term for not committing a new crime, but doing things that most would deem mistakes,\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s top public defender, Keir Bradford-Grey, ttold WHYY. \u201cIf we want mass incarceration to end, we have to understand what it looks like, and his case does exemplify that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that Williams is freed for the crimes committed by Mill and that someday we can stop holding people in prison forever even after they\u2019ve served their time.", "keywords": ["prison", "explained", "mills", "judge", "probation", "meek", "months", "bizarre", "rapper", "court", "williams", "given", "incarceration", "case"], "polarity": 0.06775734716328777, "subjectivity": 0.39078364979355096},

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand?

[Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

Its enrollment numbers were down, its membership skewed older, its finances were in shambles, and by many accounts, it had abdicated its position as a formidable leader in the fight for black advancement.\n\nWhile at the NAACP, Jealous was able to leverage technology so that its online membership increased by more than half a million people, from 175,000 to 675,000; its donor base increased more than eightfold; and it registered hundreds of thousands of new voters and mobilized 1.3 million people to turn out to the polls in 2012\u2014a significant factor in getting Barack Obama re-elected. Most presciently, the organization also began to build coalitions with other civil rights, labor and environmental groups, also finding common ground with staunch conservatives and even the Tea Party, especially around issues such as mass incarceration and criminal-justice reform.\n\nAs head of the NAACP, Jealous was most astute in recognizing the fact that the game had changed since the days of de jure segregation and open racial terror. Under his steady guidance, the outfit took on more contemporary issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, gay-marriage equality, black economic empowerment and police malfeasance such as New York City\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy. The kicker is that the NAACP didn\u2019t just raise awareness about such issues but lobbied and fought so that real change occurred. For all of this, Jealous was named to the No. 1 spot on The Root 100 in 2013.\n\nIn May, Jealous announced that he was seeking the governorship of Maryland in 2018. He and his family have a long history in the \u201cOld Line State.\u201d His grandparents came to Baltimore from southern Virginia in the 1930s, and his parents met in the state as well but eventually moved to California, where Ben was born, because interracial marriage was still illegal in Maryland in the late 1960s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJealous says that his work as both president and CEO of the NAACP, as well as his years as a community activist and, most recently, as a principal in a venture capital investment firm that funds socially conscious startups, have prepared him for this moment in time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a community organizer my entire adult life. I\u2019ve spent my life pulling people together to hold government accountable and get things done,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cAs national president of the NAACP, I led several victories\u2014here in Maryland, that included abolishing the death penalty, passing the DREAM Act, and passing marriage equality and voting rights in the same year.\u201d\n\nHis strategy for victory includes making the most of partnerships between traditional civil rights organizations and progressive groups he was able to court during his tenure as the co-chair of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my approach to this campaign,\u201d he says. \u201cMy campaign is rooted in the civil rights networks that I and my family has been a part of for decades in Maryland and in the networks we created in the Bernie campaign.

One of the two.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing that\u2019s hard for an old head like myself to admit: They\u2019re right (well, the Yachty quote is debatable, but ... whatever).\n\nIf you\u2019re still saying, \u201cThat ain\u2019t real hip-hop!\u201d you need to return your whole narrative to 2004 and go find yourself a cave to go cry in. It\u2019s all hip-hop.\n\nJazz includes contemporary, big band, acid and blue note. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll includes grunge, punk, classic and metal. Even metal includes thrash, speed, death and crust punk (we\u2019re talking subgenres inside a subgenre ... it\u2019s like Inception, but for people who like guitar music).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there\u2019s absolutely no reason why trap, snap, bass, hyphy, crunk and \u201cmumble rap\u201d (which I\u2019m just learning is a controversial term, but ... they do be mumbling!) can\u2019t be included under the umbrella genre that is hip-hop.\n\nThe argument turns left for me, however, when you tell me I can\u2019t call a thing trash when it\u2019s obviously trash. Some things aren\u2019t subjective. 2 Chainz will never be 2Pac, just like Tyler Perry will never be James Baldwin. I don\u2019t know when we got into this \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d era of hip-hop discourse, but I\u2019m telling y\u2019all, it\u2019s for the birds. It\u2019s indicative of how a lot of us have become disconnected from the full spectrum of the culture.\n\nThe larger culture has always been critical of artists and music it determined to be inferior. It\u2019s where the phrase \u201cwack emcees\u201d comes from. If it seems disrespected, it\u2019s supposed to be. Hip-hop literally invented the word \u201cdiss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true we oldies sound the same way our parents did when they were shitting all over whatever we were listening to when we were younger. But be honest, guys: Who, in their youth, ever gave a fuck about their parents\u2019 opinion on ... well ... anything? So let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s so damaging.\n\n(And, if we\u2019re being honest, our folks were right about a lot of shit. If you grew up in the \u201990s, you had Boyz II Men, Jodeci, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and a few others who might be able to hold their own sharing a stage with Motown\u2019s finest. Even Boyz II Men would just barely be holding the Temptations\u2019 jockstrap. But I digress.)\n\nThe truth is, this isn\u2019t purely a generational thing, as there is no era in hip-hop where purists (or real \u201cheads\u201d) weren\u2019t talking shit about commercial rap music. Ask Kool Herc and Grandmaster Caz what they thought about the Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d Ask Run-DMC how many elitist assholes had something to say about their crossover collaboration with Aerosmith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShit, I was calling out the unabashed wackness of mainstream pop rap when I was in my late teens and early 20s (meaning I was still of the current generation). We old-school hip-hoppers have always had a list as long as an MC Hammer remix of rappers from our era we absolutely despised. And none of our opinions had even the slightest impact on their bottom lines. Which leads me to a final question:\n\nWhy do you give a shit what we think?\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of popular music, you\u2019re on the favorable side of supply and demand, so I just don\u2019t understand the degree of contempt you have for the detractors of your faves. It\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting at the popular kids\u2019 table worried about what the second-string chess club is gossiping about. Migos spent all of 2017 at the top of every pop chart in the country. You think that nigga gives a fuck how trash I think he is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... what? Migos is three people? Well, shit\n\n\u201cWe the biggest group ever. Ever. In pop, hip-hop, all that, because every genre in music right now is structured off us. We got this culture.\u201d \u2014rapper Offset of Migos\n\nHell, try being an underground head. Think how much easier our lives would\u2019ve been if we had just liked what the masses were in to. Do you know how many women I wouldn\u2019t have had to eventually cancel because they kept hopping into my car and snatching my Pharoahe Monch out of the disc drive to bump that new Ja Rule or Nelly (by the end of this piece, you should all be able to guess my age).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI grew up in Atlanta, the city where clubbing is a staple of the culture and a rite of passage, as someone with a serious distaste for Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Boys (wait ... that\u2019s not right). I was the old guy in the club when I was, like, 22.\n\nMaybe I am just an old fogy shouting at the modern rap world to get off my lawn. But I\u2019d like to think that harsh criticism among the different sects of hip-hop fandom has always been more healthy than draining, and I fail to see how it prohibits the evolution of the culture or the ability of new generations to get their shine and add their own branches to the genre tree.\n\nTruth is, subgenre has always been present in hip-hop. What was the media-inflamed East Coast-vs.-West Coast beef but a battle between rap genres no different than when a death metal enthusiast declares their hatred for alternative punk?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll music is art, and all art\u2014when put on display\u2014is subject to the judgment and interpretation of both appreciative and unappreciative audiences.

It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

She and her husband, Jamal, planned three parties over one weekend and had $43,000 in cash on hand that her husband was taking to the bank around 11 a.m. As Jamal stopped to talk to his friends, Baltimore City Sgt. Wayne Jenkins and his partner pulled up and searched his car.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey find a small bag of marijuana, but that\u2019s a lie. But they use it as an opportunity to arrest him,\u201d defense attorney Ivan Bates told The Root. \u201cThey submit $23,000 and keep $20,000 for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bates, this was a regular tactic used by Baltimore City police to get the addresses of people whom they considered high rollers because they had expensive cars.\n\n\n\nThey then went to Jovonne Walker\u2019s house and tried to break in. Jovonne was so frightened that she pushed the silent alarm button. According to Bates, a new set of officers showed up in response to the alarm, but Jenkins and his partner said that they would handle it. They searched the house without a warrant, saying that Jovonne agreed to let them search. They later went back and obtained a warrant. They found two guns that Jovonne owned, and charged her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the aftermath of their arrests, the couple almost lost their house. Jamal, who worked as an electrician, wasn\u2019t able to get some clearances to work. One of their cars was repossessed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have your life turned upside down for almost two years, to not be able to work in a field that you\u2019re passionate about because you have pending charges. Fearing for my kids\u2019 life because someone was trying to get into our home. It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner.

I read an article today about him in GQ where he was asked, \u201cDo you, Post Malone, ever feel anxious about working in a primarily black-identified genre of music?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer, Bijan Stephen, even noted his own feelings about Malone\u2019s hypocrisy when he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m black. I\u2019m young. I\u2019ve been put off by some of the things he\u2019s said about distancing himself from rap, from R&B, from anything, really, that\u2019s musically black-identified.\u201d\n\nStephen went on to explain: \u201cI enjoy Post\u2019s music, but I\u2019m skeptical: What\u2019s worse than appropriating a black sound without giving appropriate credit is doing that and not realizing why that might be wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Lord, you are the alpha and omega, and being that you are the only one in heaven or on earth who pledged two fraternities, I\u2019m sure you already knew this, our bright and morning star. In your omnipotence, I\u2019m sure you are aware of Post Malone\u2019s response, but Imma just type it out so the copyedit team won\u2019t ask me for the quote, Almighty One. Oh, ye Giver of Life, Death and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Post Malone said:\n\nI definitely feel like there\u2019s a struggle being a white rapper. But I don\u2019t want to be a rapper. I just want to be a person that makes music. I make music that I like and I think that kicks ass, that I think the people who fuck with me as a person and as an artist will like.\n\nOh, Lord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to still this slapping spirit that is rising in my heart and tingling in my palms! Quench this desire to ask, \u201cWhat the fuck did he just say?\u201d I know it ain\u2019t nothing but the devil trying to work his way into my mind like that time Satan made me renege on the spades table and I ran a Boston in the last hand and told First Lady Chambers to get her bitch ass off my table! I felt the same thing when I read that quote from Post Malone, and I need you to eject this reneging spirit from my soul, Most High!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, Big Poppa (yes, I\u2019ve heard the gospel hymn when you said you love it when we call you that), take Post Malone\u2019s hand and guide him through the misery of being a millionaire and being white. I know it must be hard for him to exist in a world where he has every societal advantage that comes with whiteness while simultaneously getting to wade in the pool of black culture.\n\nI imagine it tastes like fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good, Evil and White Privilege. Yea, though Post Malone walks through the valley of the shadow of cultural appropriation, comfort him with your rod and staff. Or beat him.\n\nPlease beat him.\n\nAnd forgive him, Your Highness.\n\nForgive him, for he knows not what he\u2019s doing when he makes millions from an art form created by black people while distancing himself from the individuals and the struggle that birthed the art by stiff-arming anything remotely related to blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive him for dabbling in the outlaw-thug stereotype while not recognizing the privilege of not having every aspect of himself associated with the oppression and danger that goes along with his inverted shucking and jiving.\n\nOh, my Good & Plenty higher power, I know some will say that he is not guilty of cultural appropriation, but if hip-hop is a culture, and the definition of appropriation is \u201cthe deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art\u201d without attribution or acknowledgment, and Malone doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that he is a rapper, then I don\u2019t know what else to call him, dear Lord. A rap gentrifier? A rhyme colonialist? Motherfucker? (Forgive me for that, thou divine one.)\n\nBut most of all, ye magnificent with the sensational style, forgive Post Malone for his tone-deaf, oblivious whining about the paper-cut-deep criticism he receives for his third-grade-level lyrical, gold-front blackface as if he couldn\u2019t stop rapping tomorrow, waltz his ass back to the suburbs, and become the one thing in the world that is greater and exponentially more precious than being a young, famous, millionaire musician:\n\nA white man.\n\nIn this, and all things, we ask your blessings.\n\nAmen.", "keywords": ["dont", "im", "lord", "know", "sure", "black", "struggle", "white", "rapper", "malone", "prayer", "post"], "polarity": 0.13341600529100528, "subjectivity": 0.5150589726631394},

Harris was chased down and subdued by officers when Bates, a wealthy insurance executive with an affinity for law enforcement, shot Harris in the armpit. Bates claimed that he mistook his gun for his Taser but was sentenced to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nBates was deputized as a reserve officer by his a fishing partner and benefactor, Tulsa County Sheriff Stanley Glanz. Gates had donated vehicles and equipment items to the Sheriff\u2019s Department and gave money to Glanz\u2019s political campaigns, serving as the campaign manager during Glanz\u2019s 2012 run for sheriff.\n\nThe Harris family sued Bates, Glanz and four other officers for excessive force and civil rights violations. The civil suit alleged that Glanz \u201cturned a blind eye to these dangers \u2026 to allow his friend and financial benefactor to \u2018play cop\u2019 in the streets of Tulsa County.\u201d It also charged that Bates was improperly trained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the Harris shooting, an internal investigation found records that showed Bates\u2019 training records were falsified and that the county pressured investigators to deem the use of force \u201cjustifiable.\u201d\n\nThe $6 million settlement closes the civil case and bars the Harris estate from filing individual suits against the defendants in the case. The money will be paid out over three years, bringing the total cost of Bates\u2019 cop cosplay to $6.6 million for the citizens of Tulsa County, according to the Tulsa World.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of all parties involved to resolve these claims at this time,\u201d Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado said. \u201cI believe this decision will allow the process of healing to continue for the Harris family, the citizens of Tulsa County and the hardworking men and women of the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanley Glanz eventually resigned after he was charged with misdemeanor crimes in a subsequent investigation.\n\nRobert Bates served 497 days of his four-year sentence and was released in 2016.\n\nEric Harris is still dead.", "keywords": ["eric", "sheriffs", "case", "pay", "glanz", "death", "county", "tulsa", "bates", "lawsuit", "harris", "okla", "million", "civil", "officers", "excessiveforce"], "polarity": -0.003267973856209155, "subjectivity": 0.3870915032679739},

It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

One good example of the difference between the two forms of slavery was expressed by the Igbo man, Olaudah Equiano, who in his spiritual autobiography wrote that after he was captured and placed aboard a slaver he would have given anything to change places with a \u2018slave\u2019 in his own country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat African slave traders knew about slavery in the Americas was highly variable. Most probably knew very little, but some knew a lot.\n\n\n\n\u201cBear in mind, these traders did not see themselves as having a common identity with the enslaved people of other nationalities and ethnicities they traded with Europeans.\n\n\u201cThey saw themselves not as \u2018African\u2019 but rather as Aro (who enslaved and sold the Igbo), Vai (who sold the Mende), and Fante (who sold the Chamba).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did not have a racial consciousness.\n\n\u201cYou may find archival and primary sources to support these statements in my book The Slave Ship: A Human History (2007) [PDF].\u201d\n\nThe question arose after the Washington Post, which now finds itself with no African-descended people on its foreign news desk, reported in a front-page story posted Jan. 29 about the remorse over the Transatlantic slave trade felt in the small West African country of Benin. Like most media accounts, it did not mention the differences in the institution as it crossed the ocean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporter Kevin Sieff wrote, \u201cIn Benin, where the government plans to build two museums devoted to the slave trade in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution, slavery is an embattled subject. It is raised in political debates, downplayed by the descendants of slave traders and deplored by the descendants of slaves.\n\n\u201cAt a time when Americans are again debating how slavery and the Civil War are memorialized, Benin and other West African nations are struggling to resolve their own legacies of complicity in the trade. Benin\u2019s conflict over slavery is particularly intense.\n\n\u201cFor over 200 years, powerful kings in what is now the country of Benin captured and sold slaves to Portuguese, French and British merchants. The slaves were usually men, women and children from rival tribes \u2014 gagged and jammed into boats bound for Brazil, Haiti and the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe trade largely stopped by the end of the 19th century, but Benin never fully confronted what had happened. The kingdoms that captured and sold slaves still exist today as tribal networks, and so do the groups that were raided. . . .\u201d\n\nAlthough slavery wasn\u2019t imposed on a captive\u2019s future generations until the institution was transformed in the Western Hemisphere, it didn\u2019t start out that way.\n\nIn an excerpt from his \u201cStrange New Land: Africans in Colonial America\u201d published by Slate in 2015, author Peter H. Wood wrote:\n\n\u201cLike most huge changes, the imposition of hereditary race slavery was gradual, taking hold by degrees over many decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt proceeded slowly, in much the same way that winter follows fall. On any given day, in any given place, people can argue about local weather conditions. \u2018Is it getting colder?\u2019 \u2018Will it warm up again this week?\u2019 The shift may come early in some places, later in others. But eventually, it occurs all across the land. By January, people shiver and think back to September, agreeing that \u2018it is definitely colder now.\u2019 In 1700, a 70-year-old African American could look back half a century to 1650 and shiver, knowing that conditions had definitely changed for the worse.\n\n\u201cSome people had experienced the first cold winds of enslavement well before 1650; others would escape the chilling blast well after 1700. The timing and nature of the change varied considerably from colony to colony, and even from family to family. Gradually, the terrible transformation took on a momentum of its own, numbing and burdening everything in its path, like a disastrous winter storm.\n\n\u201cUnlike the changing seasons, however, the encroachment of racial slavery in the colonies of North America was certainly not a natural process. It was highly unnatural \u2014 the work of powerful competitive governments and many thousands of human beings spread out across the Atlantic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNor was it inevitable that people\u2019s legal status would come to depend upon their racial background and that the condition of slavery would be passed down from parent to child. Numerous factors combined to bring about this disastrous shift \u2014 human forces swirled together during the decades after 1650, to create an enormously destructive storm.\n\n\u201cBy 1650, hereditary enslavement based upon color, not upon religion, was a bitter reality in the older Catholic colonies of the New World. In the Caribbean and Latin America, for well over a century, Spanish and Portuguese colonizers had enslaved \u2018infidels\u2019: first Indians and then Africans.\n\n\u201cAt first, they relied for justification upon the Mediterranean tradition that persons of a different religion, or persons captured in war, could be enslaved for life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut hidden in this idea of slavery was the notion that persons who converted to Christianity should receive their freedom. Wealthy planters in the tropics, afraid that their cheap labor would be taken away from them because of this loophole, changed the reasoning behind their exploitation. . . .\u201d\n\nIt might be coincidence that this discussion is taking place during Black History Month. Rediker said in a follow-up message, \u201cThere is unfinished business with slavery everywhere. These many years later it haunts us still.\u201d\n\nPaul Ames, Politico: Portugal confronts its slave trade past\n\nJamelle Bouie and Rebecca Onion, Slate: Slavery Myths Debunked (Sept. 29, 2015)\n\nMeg Dalton, Columbia Journalism Review: Yes, the Civil War was about slavery.

And the reframing that needs to happen is to bring those voices to the table, to allow those voices to have air, to let them be believed, that communities are a key part of the public safety narrative.\n\n\u201cWithout question, Baltimore has been besieged by violent crime over the past few years. And I\u2019ve been saying for some time that until we resolve the issue of policing and trust between \u2014 the distrust, the legitimate distrust, that many members of the community have for law enforcement, we can\u2019t deal with issues of public safety.\n\n\u201cAnd this demonstrates the way in which communities have been preyed upon by officers in ways that make them unwilling to trust the police.

Oregon did so in 2005, Alaska in 2013, and Arizona in 2015. Most have not, partly because few people realize the loophole exists, and partly because it has been politically unpopular to push laws that target cops and anger their powerful unions.\n\n\u201cOf at least 158 law enforcement officers charged since 2006 with sexual assault, sexual battery, or unlawful sexual contact with somebody under their control, at least 26 have been acquitted or had charges dropped based on the consent defense, according to my review of a Buffalo News database of more than 700 law enforcement officers accused of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cIn most of the states that do not explicitly outlaw sex between on-duty cops and detainees, including New York, an officer can claim consent and face only a misdemeanor \u2018official misconduct\u2019 charge, which carries a maximum one-year sentence. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAOL: Connie Chung says she was sexually harassed \u2018every day\u2019 as she reacts to Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose scandals\n\nRen\u00e9e Graham, Boston Globe: #MeToo comes for the jerks\n\nSurprise!

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["sophia", "inside", "hyacinthe", "double", "career", "feel", "dj", "fashion", "think", "women", "dope", "york", "wardrobe", "night", "dressed", "really", "life"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Some of the deaths were deemed \u201cjustifiable,\u201d but many crossed the boundaries of what anyone would consider \u201creasonable.\u201d There was a case where police shot a drunken man through his rear window and another where they shot a woodcarver because they spotted him with a knife ... and a block of wood.\n\n\n\nIn fact, in the 213 Washington police shooting deaths between 2005 and 2014 that were examined by the Seattle Times, only one single cop was convicted.\n\nShielded by the law While most killings by police are deemed justified, controversial cases are nearly impossible to\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThat unbelievable statistic is partly due to a 1986 law that effectively made it nearly impossible to convict a cop of killing someone in Washington state. To find a law enforcement officer guilty of use of deadly force, prosecutors in the state were required to disprove four things:\n\nThe officer reasonably believed the suspect was attempting to commit a felony;\n\nThe officer believed that his life was in danger, or that others\u2019 lives were in danger; Force was \u201cnecessary;\u201d and most importantly ...\n\nThe officer acted \u201cwithout malice\u201d and in \u201cgood faith.\u201d\n\nIt was the fourth provision that was troubling. In Washington state, \u201cmalice\u201d is defined as an \u201cevil intent\u201d or an \u201cabandoned and malignant heart.\u201d If a prosecutor couldn\u2019t prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a cop who killed someone in cold blood was evil or heartless, the officer couldn\u2019t be convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lawmakers and activists had been trying to get the law changed for years, on Thursday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee finally signed into law a bill that removed the \u201cmalice\u201d requirement from the law enforcement prosecution standard, showing how legislators can come together for the sake of the communities they represent.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA! I\u2019m just bullshitting. They had no choice but to pass it.\n\nHad the legislation not passed, the measure would have gone up for a vote as a referendum this fall. The state\u2019s politicians have been debating the change for more than two years, with police unions and law enforcement groups lobbying against it, even though polls showed that Washington citizens favored the measure by 75 percent. The Legislature\u2019s version signed Thursday gives police input on new deadly-force rules, whereas the public referendum wouldn\u2019t have necessarily done so, according to The Stranger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s right. It was money from lobbyists that held the law up for so long, and the only thing that changed was when the will of the people put the lawmakers between a rock and a hard place. (If you\u2019ve never leaned against a stack of dollar bills from police unions and corrections officers, let me tell you\u2014it\u2019s as hard as a rock.)\n\nThe elected officials were not moved by Washington\u2019s surge in police killings, like the death of Charlena Lyles, the 30-year-old pregnant mother of four shot at least seven times in her home by Seattle police officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, it was the money that did it, which explains their reluctance to change the law. Because when it comes to causing the deaths of citizens through their reckless actions, there is only one way to describe the 30-plus years that lawmakers allowed killer police officers to walk away scot-free:\n\nEvil.", "keywords": ["cops", "wait", "washington", "evil", "30yearold", "convicted", "shot", "officer", "lawmakers", "enforcement", "killer", "cop", "changes", "deaths", "state", "malice", "law"], "polarity": 0.004472465518977165, "subjectivity": 0.6460359408033827},

The black population in the county plunged by 122,032 people from 1980 to 2014, according to the report. The county has gained around 2.5 million residents overall during that time. In the meantime, black workers have flocked to the Inland Empire, which includes Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Those counties gained a combined 260,494 black residents from 1980 to 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLola Smallwood Cuevas, founder of the Los Angeles Black Worker Center, told the Times: \u201cBlack workers are often the last hired and the first fired. If we don\u2019t address the crisis, we will have a city and a county where there are no black workers.\u201d\n\nThe report notes that \u201cwhile the black community was once a thriving part of L.A.\u2019s landscape and remains integral to the county\u2019s cultural and economic life, it has long been in a critical decline.\u201d This is directly attributed to the lack of jobs for black Angelenos.\n\nThe report says that \u201ceconomic and social hardship is pushing the black community out of Los Angeles County\u201d and notes that although blacks in Los Angeles are significantly more educated than previous generations, they experience a lower labor-participation rate and a significantly higher unemployment rate than their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the report:\n\nThe study calls for a stabilization of black families and communities through the creation of well-paying, quality, accessible jobs. Among other solutions, report authors recommend the unionization of black workers, an expansion of hiring benchmarks that include underrepresented workers, and an institutionalization of partnerships with credible community organizations to implement targeted outreach, recruitment, and retention programs. Through an analysis of current and historical census data, a comprehensive literature review, and the collection of worker\u2019s stories and case studies, the report looks at the experience of the black community in Los Angeles through a labor and employment lens. It details how the lack of access to quality jobs is adversely impacting the community and draws a portrait of the challenges that black workers in Los Angeles face.\n\nNow, if only we could get some of these suggestions implemented so that the black community in Los Angeles can be revived and revitalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the UCLA Labor Center and the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["thats", "community", "decline", "angeles", "county", "black", "la", "unemployed", "workers", "jobs", "face", "crisis", "los", "white", "report"], "polarity": -0.0047806422433288075, "subjectivity": 0.3755404794210765},

It\u2019s the same talk that has been given time and again in black families following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher and Michael Brown, all unarmed black civilians who lost their lives at the hands of police.\n\n\n\nWhen Baltimore City erupted into riots following the death of Freddie Gray, I found myself in the basement of a local church having a larger version of the talk. In that basement, dozens of young activists had gathered to protest what they viewed as another example of excessive police force taking the life of an unarmed black person. I wanted them to know how to be safe while peacefully making their voices heard.\n\n\n\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, I was inspired to go back to my activist roots. I had already led the NAACP and, before that, spent decades as a civil rights leader and community organizer. As I thought through how I wanted to contribute in the Trump era, I thought back to my talk with my son, my grandfather\u2019s talk with me and the talk I gave those young activists in Baltimore.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions in the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, I decided to launch my campaign for governor of Maryland in part because the times require elected leaders who understand these issues and have the courage to act. Only then can we finally have a generation where, perhaps, \u201cthe talk\u201d won\u2019t be needed.\n\n\n\nWe have a long way to go, but we can stop the killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of police and, in doing so, make our communities safer. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good and decent people, but their reputations and ability to do their jobs effectively are tarnished by a small number of bad officers who don\u2019t deserve to wear a badge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actions of these bad officers have resulted in senseless deaths and millions of dollars in police settlements\u2014money that could have been used to help educate our children. For these reasons and so much more, we can\u2019t have the 2018 elections come and go without challenging every candidate for office to put forward his or her plan to address police misconduct and the killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nMy plan for Maryland is one that could be adopted in whole or in part in any state. Entitled Building Trust (pdf), the plan calls for increased civilian oversight, both in any specific instance when an officer is accused of misconduct and more broadly to provide input into how police departments should be structured and relate to their communities. I also call for a special prosecutor\u2019s office that oversees all allegations of police misconduct and ensures that the often cozy relationship between the police officers who commit crimes and those charged with punishing them is no more.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould a police settlement occur, my plan would end the practice of nondisclosure agreements so that victims of police brutality are not silenced. My plan would also create a public database that tracked every instance of police use of force so that this information is easily accessible and searchable. This reduces the chances that an officer with a troubled past will be able to move from one jurisdiction to another without scrutiny.\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust is not just the title of this plan; it is essential if we are to stop the killings of unarmed civilians, end police corruption and improve public safety. Trust becomes tattered when officers are insufficiently trained and unaccountable to civilian oversight, and when those who violate the public\u2019s trust are too often protected by a pervasive culture of impunity. In this plan we outline key ways that state and local governments can implement key reforms to create strong bonds of trust between communities and the police departments sworn to protect them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding Trust seeks to break the false dichotomy that improving public safety has to come at the price of justice, or that if you are opposed to police misconduct, you are anti-police. My grandfather\u2019s example demonstrates that most officers are hardworking individuals seeking to protect our communities. We owe it to them to give them the proper training they need and to root out those within their ranks who fail to live up to their badges.\n\n\n\nWe should not allow any official seeking public office to secure our vote without them first listing in detail where they stand on this basic issue of fairness, justice and public safety. We need members of Congress who will stand up to Trump and Sessions, and we need leaders at the state level who will replace those in leadership who have been silent on these issues. I hope to achieve that for Maryland by defeating our current governor, Larry Hogan, who continues to be silent despite the unrest that occurred in our state\u2019s largest city following the death of Freddie Gray, and a recent police corruption trial that showed how broken the Baltimore City Police Department is.\n\n\n\nWe can end corruption, stop the killings of unarmed civilians and finally create the trust that will provide the safety we need in our neighborhoods. There is no shortage of solutions to these problems, just a shortage of leaders with the courage to address them head-on. In 2018, at the ballot box, we must demand better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, tech investor and Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland.

The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn\u2019t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow people are wondering.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of The Wire. It has revealed how one of America\u2019s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man\u2019s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, \u201cIf you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the revelation that the supervisor of the unit instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves \u201cin a jam\u201d and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn\u2019t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won\u2019t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before he was set to testify.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: After the death of Freddie Gray and the discovery of multiple officers who planted drugs on suspects, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they\u2019re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the cop who killed Tamir Rice after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who said he shot a man because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid police informant planted cocaine in a store owner\u2019s shop.\n\nIt is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away.

It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner. It\u2019s gonna take a while to change the culture. But you have to prosecute the officers that are doing it and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["city", "say", "killings", "sold", "jovonne", "abuse", "pick", "bates", "pieces", "baltimore", "drugs", "covered", "jenkins", "gun", "officers", "stole", "house"], "polarity": 0.020850306342109614, "subjectivity": 0.40127510922592896},

Though Meek exposed Drizzy for employing ghostwriters\u2014a damning accusation in the world of real hip-hop\u2014Drake\u2019s legions of postpubescent female fans didn\u2019t seem to care that he\u2019s a bona fide goddamn fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year later, homie Robert Rihmeek Williams somehow managed to haplessly trip into another beef with the Game, dusty Philly street rapper Beanie Sigel and useless dancehall queen Sean Kingston in a cavalcade of messiness that sounds as if it was cooked up in a game of Cards Against Humanity.\n\nIf Drake\u2019s response tracks (one of which was nominated for a Grammy) were physical entities, they\u2019d evaporate upon touching water. But Game curb-stomped Meek so bad that Nicki Minaj is probably having earnest conversations with her mama about how to proceed in this life. All of Meek\u2019s responses have been trash-bag, and his loss in both battles is uncontested by anyone who didn\u2019t carry him in utero.\n\nBut at least bars (or things resembling them) were exchanged\u2014a significant occurrence in an age when they seem to matter progressively less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d hate for the younger generation to look at today\u2019s rap \u201cbeef\u201d and think that\u2019s what it was always like. Grabbing a notepad and stepping in the studio with bellicose bars of fury has been replaced with bitching via 140 characters on Twitter, which is the rap-beef equivalent of showing your support for a tragedy with a flag filter.\n\nWhile there are now many who weren\u2019t yet drawing breath when rap beef became a significant part of hip-hop. There have been many throughout the past three-and-a-half decades or so, but these are my favorites:\n\nJadakiss vs. Beanie Sigel\n\nThanks to his little tangle with Meek Mill and the Game (not to mention a quasi-coherent appearance in a BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher and squabbling with Charlamagne on The Breakfast Club), One-Lung Beans is kinda, sorta back in the public spotlight now. In the year the towers fell, though, he was an East Coast rap titan who got into a bar-trading beef with peer Jadakiss, thanks to a stupid misunderstanding. I wouldn\u2019t have put one emcee over the other in relation to skills back then, but Kiss caught the L when Beans murdered him on his own beat. Winner: Beanie Sigel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n50 Cent vs. Ja Rule\n\nAs much as I loathed 50 Cent in the midaughts for being a power-hungry douche canoe with two overrated albums, it was impressive to see his crushing influence transform grunt-rap-singing progenitor Ja Rule from a multiplatinum artist into a would-be lettuce supervisor at McDowell\u2019s. Ja\u2019s fall from grace included a two-year bid for gun charges and tax evasion, and a post-prison album that went double Kleenex. While neither man really matters as a rapper in late 2016, Curtis is definitely doing better these days. That they picked the beef back up via Twitter last year is simply a reminder of how sad it is when dusty, 40-something rap niggas settle anything using social media. Winner: 50 Cent.\n\nCommon vs. Ice Cube\n\nUnless it\u2019s playing at my salon while I\u2018m getting a pedicure, I\u2019ll probably never watch the most recent Barbershop film. But I know that Common and Cube are buddy-buddy in the film, and most uninitiated viewers were probably like, \u201cOoh, the guys from Road Trip and Are We There Yet? Awesome sauce!\u201d But heads remember when Rashid suggested in his classic \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d that hip-hop fell off when the West Coast went mainstream. Cube\u2019s Westside Connection clapped back with a record that no one remembers, provoking Common\u2019s riposte \u201cThe Bitch in Yoo,\u201d a top five GOAT diss record. Both men have had successful careers since 1996, but from a purely rap standpoint, Com takes it. Check out this good retrospective on the beef. Winner: Common.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoogie Down Productions vs. the Juice Crew\n\nThis is for the gray-haired heads too busy driving their children to basketball practice to check for new hip-hop. The battle between KRS-One\u2019s BDP and MC Shan\u2019s Juice Crew was strictly about staking a claim to hip-hop\u2019s origins. When Shan intimated on \u201cThe Bridge\u201d that hip-hop started in New York City\u2019s Queensbridge projects, BDP responded with \u201cSouth Bronx,\u201d letting cats know about the true birth borough of hip-hop. And so on and so forth it went, with a trading of tracks that, let\u2019s be honest, no one is casually listening to in 2016. From a perspective of career longevity, KRS-One has it, but I can\u2019t rightly say there\u2019s a winner here. If you want a less corny peek into the history of hip-hop than Netflix\u2019s The Get Down could muster, read up on this beef. Winner: Draw.\n\nTupac vs. the Notorious B.I.G.\n\nThe genre\u2019s most culturally impactful beef because it defined a generation of hip-hop and (allegedly) resulted in the death of two hip-hop legends. Books and articles (some more credible than others) have been written on the topic of the Pac-Biggie beef and the years long East Coast-West Coast rap war that culminated in their murders. But while Big was the stronger rapper of the two, by far (fight me), Pac issued the strongest salvo with \u201cHit \u2019Em Up\u201d and the extremely disrespectful accompanying video. Back when it was OK to rap about banging someone else\u2019s wife and not expect a Salon.com think piece condemning it. Winner: Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN.W.A vs. Ice Cube\n\nProof that you don\u2019t alienate the LeBron of your team without negative consequences. Anyone who knows what he\u2019s talking about will tell you that N.W.A would not have been the powerhouse it was without Cube. When O\u2019Shea found out he was getting bent over on royalties (with no Vaseline), he left the group, which in turn took shots at him on wax. Cube ended the bullshit with \u201cNo Vaseline,\u201d a scathing indictment of a whole crew of\u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014fake gangsta-ass niggas. Folks don\u2019t remember what N.W.A said about Cube, but everyone remembers \u201cNo Vaseline,\u201d performed to great effect in Straight Outta Compton. Winner: Ice Cube.\n\nJay Z vs. Nas\n\nThe gold standard for rap beef, mainly because the two rappers co-owned New York\u2014and, by extension, hip-hop\u2014in 2001, when they stopped taking little pot shots at each other and went hard body. They are also arguably the two strongest emcees to engage in a war of bars with each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTakeover\u201d is a hot, early-era Kanye West track from Jay\u2019s second-best album, but \u201cEther\u201d reminded everyone that Nas is the superior rapper. Hov was so butt-hurt over the perceived loss that he crafted \u201cSuper Ugly,\u201d a completely outta-line diss track that makes the Drake-Cudi business seem like light work and even provoked Jay\u2019s mama to have him apologize publicly.\n\nDespite squashing their beef, they\u2019ve yet to create the classic joint album we all wanted\u2014something their egos probably won\u2019t abide. It\u2019s been a long time since there were two truly dope mainstream rappers who could craft a meaningful rivalry like this; it would be akin to Kendrick Lamar going to war with \u2026 some dude we don\u2019t know exists yet.

Polanco\u2019s Afro-Latina beauty plays loud and proud, as she\u2019s now partnered with legacy brand Dove on the company\u2019s self-esteem-education workshops.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, since founding the initiative in 2004, Dove has become the largest provider of self-esteem education in the world, reaching more young people than any nongovernmental organization, educational institution or government at 20 million and counting. The Glow Up had the pleasure of talking with boundary-breaking actress Polanco at Dove\u2019s latest workshop for teens.\n\nThe Glow Up: You\u2019ve always been outspoken about beauty inequality. Why did you partner with Dove?\n\nDascha Polanco: I\u2019m being very honest with you: I remember when Dove first came out with that billboard\u2014all the women wearing full briefs. I\u2019m a full-brief kind of girl, you know what I mean? When I saw Dove embrace real women and real bodies, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where brands need to be headed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I learned that they\u2019ve partnered with Shonda Rhimes on self-esteem-education workshops and that they\u2019ve helped over 20 million young girls to have a positive relationship with themselves and self-esteem and body confidence, it was something that I wanted to be part of.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the goal?\n\nDP: Allowing this new generation to enter positions of power with open minds. We are teaching them to be willing to look beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to think is right or what\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Can you share ways that you lift your own self-esteem?\n\nDP: It\u2019s very important to have gender equality in my household [so] that things are done across the board\u2014not because you\u2019re a boy, not because you\u2019re a girl\u2014but because you\u2019re both equally valuable. You both have the capacity, the ability, to go far farther than me, beyond me\u2014your opportunities are limitless. Whenever I feel like I have a positive impact, I can bring my daughter to the Dove self-esteem workshops and she can learn from these resources.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do people have to go in person to the workshop?\n\nDP: Dove has the resources on the website. They also have parenting courses about how self-esteem starts in the home. When you look at studies of bullying in school, depression and suicidal behaviors have gone up because of not paying attention to the real issues affecting the youth. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids. Stand in front of the mirror and say \u201cI am powerful,\u201d \u201cI am beautiful,\u201d \u201cI am smart,\u201d \u201cI can do anything.\u201d Make mood boards.

What are a couple of goals within the next month to get you there?\u201d\n\nAnd I do that with my daughter. I\u2019m in [a] constant battle with my daughter Dasany, who doesn\u2019t leave the house without her eyebrows painted on.

After the officers had restrained Anderson in handcuffs, Officer Zachary Rosen, to make sure the arrested man was not armed, decided to run through the four cops who were already handling Anderson and step on the detainee\u2019s head so hard that it visibly bounced off of the street like a basketball.\n\nWhen video of Rosen\u2019s alleged assault began to spread, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus fired Rosen after Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan found Rosen\u2019s actions to be unreasonable. (Do I have to say \u201calleged\u201d? Unless there was a roach on Anderson\u2019s ear, we can see that his head being stomped on was an act of police brutality.)\n\nPettus\u2019 decision overruled four lower-ranking supervisors in the Columbus Police Department who found Rosen\u2019s use of force to be within policy. Police Chief Kim Jacobs recommended that the officer receive only a few days\u2019 suspension and training on how to search for weapons on suspects. Rosen was apparently unaware that marching on someone\u2019s cranium is a less-than-effective frisking technique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a 27-page ruling on Monday, arbitrator Mitchell Goldberg declared that Rosen could return to work as a Columbus police officer. Goldberg decided that Rosen used more force than necessary, but there was no evidence showing that Rosen intended to injure Anderson, WOSU-FM reports, which could only mean one of two things:\n\nArbitrator Mitchell Golberg is an idiot; or Just before hearing this case, someone stomped on arbitrator Michael Goldberg\u2019s head and Goldberg thinks he\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Goldberg in his decision:\n\nI find that the grievant\u2019s past good work record, and his performance at the highest rewarded level, combined with his intelligence level, is persuasive evidence that he has the ability to adjust his actions to conform with policies and directives in the future as they relate to his use of force in bringing dangerous suspects under control.\n\nYou may be confused about how a video of Rosen committing a crime is excluded from his \u201cpast good work\u201d and the fact that he was fired doesn\u2019t undermine the gobbledygook about his intelligence level, and how he will most assuredly conform to policies in the future. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand how\u2014unless Rosen tripped and fell on Anderson\u2019s head\u2014he didn\u2019t \u201cintend to injure\u201d him. But you\u2019re not a legal scholar, and you\u2019re forgetting the important legal precedent set in the historic Supreme Court case Police v. Every Black Person Ever, when the court issued a majority opinion that read in part:\n\n\u201cWhite people can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nYes, Goldberg excused the headstomper (which is different from a \u201chotstepper\u201d) by explaining how Rosen was a very good police officer when he wasn\u2019t doing the Electric Slide across black men\u2019s skulls, and how he was pretty sure Rosen wouldn\u2019t do it anymore because he only did it once, and that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosen will undergo intense training for not stomping on people\u2019s noggins before returning to work to terrorize the citizens of Columbus.

Officer William Porter, the sixth officer involved, does not face any administrative charges.\n\nGray\u2019s death while in custody prompted weeks of civil unrest and protests in the city of Baltimore. It also led to a Justice Department investigation into the Baltimore Police Department, the results of which revealed implicit racial bias and led to a consent decree agreement between the department and the DOJ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday the Justice Department said that both its prosecutors as well as the FBI had devoted \u201csignificant time and resources\u201d into investigating Gray\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that the officers violated department policy in failing to seatbelt Gray, those failures suggest civil negligence rather than the high standard of deliberate indifference,\u201d the department said in its statement.\n\nThe DOJ also decided that, in AP\u2019s words, \u201cit would be impossible for investigators to prove the officers intentionally ignored Gray\u2019s medical needs because he had vomit and blood on his face and appeared not to be breathing at the end of the ride, symptoms he did not [show] earlier.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, even though we know the Baltimore Police Department has been found to have discriminatory practices as well as widespread abuse and misconduct among its officers, we can\u2019t get justice for Freddie Gray.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the one person who tried to hold the officers accountable for doing their jobs, Mosby, is now herself under fire for daring to go after them for his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t get justice. We can\u2019t get peace.\n\nBut we have our fill of crooked police.\n\nRead more at ABC News.\n\n", "keywords": ["department", "justice", "grays", "death", "prosecutors", "involved", "baltimore", "bring", "charges", "civil", "officers", "gray", "freddie"], "polarity": -0.055833333333333325, "subjectivity": 0.3689285714285714},

And after that an administrator at a University. And I ran a summer camp one summer. And before any of that happened, I was a school student for 17 years. My point? I know what bullying looks like. I know what it tastes like. (Unseasoned meatloaf.) I know what it smells like. (Chlorine.) I'm an expert in detecting and acknowledging bullying. And what rappers \u2014 and rap fans \u2014 are doing to Meek Mill right now qualifies as bullying. You all are bullying Meek Mill, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\n\"So\" I hear you saying to yourself in my head right now \"how does Meek Mill qualify? He's rich, he's famous, he has a banging girlfriend, and he's homies with Beanie Sigel \u2014 qualities that should make him impervious to bullying.\" And you're right. On paper, Young Rameek is a very unlikely candidate for bullying. But his status hasn't prevented him from falling victim to what bullies do. Even Jewish-Canadian bullies with Carlito Brigante's beard. Which is find a person's sensitive/weak spot, and continue picking at and probing and bringing attention to it. In Meek's case, it's that he's a battle rapper \u2014 a guy who made his bones in street freestyle battles in Philadelphia \u2014 who's just not good at battle rapping.\n\nIt's the cruelest of ironies, really. It's like a kid who got a reputation for being a great boxer. And then you learn that he has no arms. Which makes you wonder how the hell he even got that rep. (Was he just boxing other armless men? Is shoulder boxing a thing in Philly?) But, although he possesses nan arm, he still has that reputation. Which is why it's not considered bullying when bullies like The Game and Drake mess with him. Despite the fact that it's been proven time and time and time and time and time and time and time again that there's absolutely nothing he can do to defend himself. Because listening to a Meek Mill diss track is like watching an armless man fight James Harrison.\n\nSo, if you care at all about setting a good example for our children, lets stop the bullying of Meek Mill now. We need to let him know that we're there for him. That we won't stand by and allow this defenseless 29-year-old to be bullied. And that it will get better.

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list?

Polanco\u2019s Afro-Latina beauty plays loud and proud, as she\u2019s now partnered with legacy brand Dove on the company\u2019s self-esteem-education workshops.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, since founding the initiative in 2004, Dove has become the largest provider of self-esteem education in the world, reaching more young people than any nongovernmental organization, educational institution or government at 20 million and counting. The Glow Up had the pleasure of talking with boundary-breaking actress Polanco at Dove\u2019s latest workshop for teens.\n\nThe Glow Up: You\u2019ve always been outspoken about beauty inequality. Why did you partner with Dove?\n\nDascha Polanco: I\u2019m being very honest with you: I remember when Dove first came out with that billboard\u2014all the women wearing full briefs. I\u2019m a full-brief kind of girl, you know what I mean? When I saw Dove embrace real women and real bodies, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where brands need to be headed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I learned that they\u2019ve partnered with Shonda Rhimes on self-esteem-education workshops and that they\u2019ve helped over 20 million young girls to have a positive relationship with themselves and self-esteem and body confidence, it was something that I wanted to be part of.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the goal?\n\nDP: Allowing this new generation to enter positions of power with open minds. We are teaching them to be willing to look beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to think is right or what\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Can you share ways that you lift your own self-esteem?\n\nDP: It\u2019s very important to have gender equality in my household [so] that things are done across the board\u2014not because you\u2019re a boy, not because you\u2019re a girl\u2014but because you\u2019re both equally valuable. You both have the capacity, the ability, to go far farther than me, beyond me\u2014your opportunities are limitless. Whenever I feel like I have a positive impact, I can bring my daughter to the Dove self-esteem workshops and she can learn from these resources.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do people have to go in person to the workshop?\n\nDP: Dove has the resources on the website. They also have parenting courses about how self-esteem starts in the home. When you look at studies of bullying in school, depression and suicidal behaviors have gone up because of not paying attention to the real issues affecting the youth. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids. Stand in front of the mirror and say \u201cI am powerful,\u201d \u201cI am beautiful,\u201d \u201cI am smart,\u201d \u201cI can do anything.\u201d Make mood boards.

What are a couple of goals within the next month to get you there?\u201d\n\nAnd I do that with my daughter. I\u2019m in [a] constant battle with my daughter Dasany, who doesn\u2019t leave the house without her eyebrows painted on. She has eyebrows, but they\u2019re light eyebrows and I\u2019m like, \u201cGirl!\u201d I try to emphasize that with her beautiful skin right now, she doesn\u2019t need anything. I do whatever I can to make a positive impact, like bringing my daughter to this workshop with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about words and what they hear; words penetrate your children so much.

And, so, the cops pulled him over.\n\nFair enough, right?\n\nHowever, the situation quickly escalated into an officer dragging Hubbard to the ground before punching him repeatedly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook user Lashaunda Malone captured footage of the incident, which originally went viral with almost 6 million views. That footage only shows the beating, with Hubbard on the ground with an officer straddling him and viciously punching him with both hands as Hubbard\u2019s female companion screams.\n\n\u201cMommy, what are the police doing?\u201d a child can be heard asking in the background of the video.\n\n\u201cOh my God, he\u2019s punching him,\u201d the woman can be heard saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, you know how it is, cops like to talk about the \u201cfull story\u201d not being captured in bystander video. On Monday, however, police managed to release the dashcam footage of the incident, and the \u201cfull story\u201d doesn\u2019t look much better.\n\nIn the police video, Hubbard can be seen arguing a bit with the officers who pulled over him and his companion, his voice seeming to remain calm the whole time. Police claim that a \u201cviolent struggle\u201d broke out when Hubbard ignored officers\u2019 orders to face away from the arresting officers so he could be taken into custody, the Post notes.\n\nHowever, the footage appears to show Hubbard getting out of his car. And as soon as the officer tells Hubbard to face away, the 25-year-old appears to barely have enough time for the command to register before the cop grabs him and pins him to the side of the vehicle, then slams him onto the ground. Then comes the assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the officer drags Hubbard to the ground and starts to hit him, his partner comes around to help him. That is when Hubbard\u2019s companion, a black woman, gets out of the car and begins to scream.\n\n\u201cBae, stop. Please listen, just let them do what they do,\u201d she can be heard saying.\n\nOne officer is seen slamming Hubbard against the pavement before punching him several times. Although police say that Hubbard was resisting, video appears to show him lying on the ground, only attempting to defend himself from the officer\u2019s strikes with his arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings start to get grimy when an officer claims that he sees Hubbard \u201creaching down.\u201d Hubbard insists that he doesn\u2019t have a gun, screaming, \u201cRecord this shit! Record it!\u201d\n\nOne of the officers repeatedly punches Hubbard again before bystanders and more police begin to arrive. Officers then cuff Hubbard\u2019s hands behind his back as an outraged crowd looks on.\n\nHubbard\u2019s companion is also arrested, which raises more questions.\n\n\u201cWhat am I under arrest for?\u201d she can be heard asking.\n\nThe video ends with the two people being taken away into custody.\n\nAccording to the Post, police have not identified the officer involved in beating up Hubbard, but said that he was placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis entire incident will be reviewed, in detail, so that the public can have a full and open understanding of the series of events that eventually led to this violent encounter,\u201d a department spokesman said.\n\nNonetheless, both videos have city officials, activists and residents demanding answers about why the use of force was necessary against Hubbard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe videos of the incident on Saturday morning raise some very serious concerns,\u201d Euclid Mayor Kirsten Gail said in a statement, according to the Post. \u201cWe have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all use of force by police are both lawful and justified. I can assure you the incident will be reviewed thoroughly, and appropriate action will be taken.\u201d\n\nViolent cops never rest ... well, unless they have to face off against white supremacists terrorizing the community; then, apparently, they get really quiet.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nHubbard was ultimately charged with driving under suspension and resisting arrest. He was taken to the Cuyahoga County Jail Euclid Annex, where he was medically examined and posted bond shortly after.

Apparently, Ruggiero takes that as some kind of challenge to his authority.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is go home, man. I\u2019m tired. I just got off work,\u201d Rush responds.\n\n\u201cYou just committed four crimes in a row,\u201d Ruggiero can be heard saying. \u201cI was polite with you and asked you [to] use the crosswalk. I know what you\u2019re doing man, you think I\u2019m a punk. Guess what? I\u2019m not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two options: I can either arrest you or write you a ticket,\u201d Ruggiero adds.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me, man,\u201d Rush responds. \u201cDo what you have got to do, besides keep harassing me.\u201d\n\nRush then swears in what appears to be exasperation, apparently prompting Hickman to arrest him. Hickman tells him to put his hands behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush then takes off running.\n\n\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Hickman curses.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s funny is you\u2019re going to get fucked up hard-core,\u201d Hickman then yells at Rush as he points his Taser at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush told the Citizen Times that he stopped, but in the video, Hickman and at least one other officer are seen pushing him to the ground, where Hickman starts punching him repeatedly in the head.\n\n\u201cPut your hands behind your back, put your hands behind your back,\u201d Hickman says, even as he strikes Rush.\n\nDuring the beating, Rush can be heard yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d and is also heard screaming for help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRush was shocked with a Taser multiple times throughout the arrest.\n\n\u201cAll this over you getting a ticket,\u201d Hickman can be heard telling Rush after he decided to stop beating him and officers got him restrained. \u201cNow it\u2019s serious, bro.\u201d\n\nRush appears to have said something that could not be heard on camera, because then Hickman starts to taunt him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a \u2018please\u2019 now, is it?\u201d Hickman says. \u201cAfter all that?

Fucking asshole.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Rush recounts the incident to other officers on the scene, he claims that Rush tried to grab his Taser.\n\nMeanwhile, Rush told the newspaper that he was taken to the hospital after the encounter, and that while there, Hickman continued to be abusive and even used a racial slur.\n\nRush was charged with assault on a government official; resisting, delaying and obstructing an officer; and trespass and traffic offenses, but those charges were all thrown out by the Buncombe County District Attorney\u2019s Office back in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice Chief Tammy Hooper said that after reviewing the video, both she and District Attorney Todd Williams asked the state Bureau of Investigation to start a criminal investigation, but the bureau declined.

Mosby has identified at least 43 cases that will be dismissed after a police officer basically admitted to faking a police video, leaving many people wondering, \u201cDamn, are there any criminals in Baltimore, or are B-more cops out on the streets making their own episodes of The Wire every day?\u201d\n\nTo be fair, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office did not describe the video as \u201cfaked.\u201d It also did not use the word \u201cadmitted\u201d in describing the officer\u2019s actions. In its words, one of Baltimore\u2019s finest \u201cself-reported\u201d an incident that looked like the cop had found evidence, only it was, in fact, a \u201cre-enactment of the seizure of evidence,\u201d according to the Baltimore Sun. Seems legit, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, prosecutors released a video showing Police Officer Richard Pinheiro hiding a bag of alleged drugs in a backyard, walking into an alley, turning his camera on and then \u201cdiscovering\u201d the illegal substances. Pinheiro was suspended pending further investigation, and the two cops with him were placed on administrative duty. The incident forced the state to drop 68 cases and review another 133.\n\nA few weeks later, a second video emerged of officers searching a man\u2019s car but finding nothing. The officers then turned their cameras on and miraculously found drugs in the same car. The state postponed 44 cases and are reviewing another 170 cases in which those three officers were involved.\n\nIn both cases, Police Commissioner Ken Davis said he was investigating the possibility that the officers legitimately discovered the drugs but decided to re-enact the discoveries because ...umm ... well, he didn\u2019t actually explain that part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommissioner Davis also did not mention how any citizen is supposed to trust the Baltimore Police Department ever again. He also did not comment on the thousands of people who might be in jail on trumped-up charges. Also not mentioned is why the officers thought they needed to \u201cre-enact\u201d finding evidence when they didn\u2019t have video evidence for the 260 years before body cameras.\n\nSome speculate that officers are faking videos because they are under pressure to fulfill arrest quotas. WJZ in Baltimore reports it found an internal memo that warns officers that they need to \u201cmake statistics, car stops and produce warrants.\u201d The memo goes on to say that the department will collect these stats every two hours to make sure officers are performing.\n\nPolice spokesman T.J. Smith said of the latest allegations regarding what is now a third video: \u201cThis is not an allegation of planting evidence. This is a self-reported situation where the officer felt that it deserved more scrutiny based on the things that have been in the news. ...

Taye made headlines and our shit list when he said he doesn\u2019t want his biracial son to be referred to as \u201cBlack.\u201d I\u2019m always bewildered when stars feel like they need to trumpet their half-cocked opinions to the masses like anyone is checking for real talk from Taye Diggs. Personally, I was tired of hearing all of my homeboys constantly wonder when the dude who was friends with Brown Sugar-era Sanaa Lathan\u2014but never tried to hit \u2014 would finally release his philosophies on race and ethnicity. I can logically believe that a man with a white wife isn\u2019t necessarily filled with self-hate, but when that man effectively says, \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to be viewed in the same way the world views me, and my father and his father\u2026\u201d I think someone should step in and say, \u201cYou know they\u2019re recording this, right? People can hear you.\u201d We heard you loud and clear, Taye. That\u2019s why we stopped messing with you.\n\nAnyway, thinking about the Diggs made me think about who else would be on this list. Who else did the Congregation of Negros Collective decide to boot off the island this year?\n\nMeek Mills He got bodied by a singing nigga. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the reason. I know it\u2019s shallow and petty, but if you get beat down by anyone, and that person\u2019s next move is to release a video doing the white-boy shuffle in an empty room wearing a cardigan and Dockers, we can\u2019t fuck with you anymore. I\u2019m gonna reveal a secret to you all: Drake\u2019s beatdown of Meek sent the dark-skinned brother community into a tailspin. First, Steph Curry wins the NBA MVP, then this. One minute Meek was the hottest, hardest rapper, on the biggest tour in hip hop (or his girl\u2019s tour), and then, poof he fucked it all up. On Twitter! It\u2019s almost like his homey Will Smith waved that light pen from \u201cMen in Black\u201d in front of our eyes and Meek was erased from our memories and Nikki Minaj\u2019s vagina history. Meek, you\u2019re from Philly, dog. You\u2019ve dropped below Will Smith on the totem pole of hard-ass Philly niggas to somewhere between Charli Baltimore and Lee Daniels. Speaking of Philly\u2026\n\nBill Cosby This was a hard year for Pill Bill. When decades-old allegations of rape resurfaced, it seemed like Black people were going to ride with Bill for a minute. Those of us not offended by his \u201cpull up your pants\u201d rants were going to stick up for the man who laced our childhood with memories of Mushmouth and fine-ass Lisa Bonet and pudding pops (niggas wasn\u2019t fucking with pudding before our Uncle Bill made it cool). The Black narrative was, \u201cThey\u201d were trying to set him up, because he was going to buy NBC, or start the first Black-owned network with Oprah, or resurrect the corpse of Michael Jackson and Sojourner Truth or some other unbelievable shit. We thought it was just another conspiracy until allegations started coming out of the woodwork like roaches when you turn out the lights at Wiz Khalifa\u2019s house (I don\u2019t care how clean he is, or where he lives, Wiz just looks like he has roaches at the crib). After Jill Scott took back her Twitter rant, the only people left standing in Bill\u2019s corner were Camille, Theo and Rudy (I know, but to Black America those are their real names). Even Vanessa abandoned ship, although it\u2019s still just a case of He said/She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. (Add 42 more)\n\nDonald Trump This list is not just limited to Black people. We used to love Donald Trump, because, like many people we fuck with, The Donald likes gaudy gold shit, owns a lot of flashy cars while living in an apartment, and he loves to brag about how he\u2019s getting money and bad bitches. Now that I think about it \u2014 Trump might be a gangster rapper. Anyway, Donald Trump ran for President and went full Pat Buchanan on us. The truth is, Black people are used to finding out their white friend is secretly racist, but Trump went from walling out and rounding up Mexicans to registering Muslims to okaying the beating of a Black Lives Matter protester. Say what you will about the Orange Fuhrer\u2019s lack of a plan for immigration reform, but his racism is comprehensive as hell. We just can\u2019t fuck with him anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture If you tied me up, held a rusty knife to my penis and told me you\u2019d cut it off unless I named a Future song, I couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t even know if Future is a rapper or a singer. The only thing I know about Future is that it\u2019s widely agreed that he\u2019s a fuckboy. I can\u2019t say what I would do if I had to listen to Ciara sing every day, so I have a place of sympathy for Future, but having Twitter fights and throwing baby mama shade in the press seems very bitch-nigga-ish to me. Plus, you have to have impeccable fuckboy credentials for a woman to leave you for a man who\u2019s giving her no D. But, you know, they say it\u2019s not the size of the boat\u2026\n\nThats what I\u2019d have to keep telling myself after my kidnappers found out I didn\u2019t know any Future songs.\n\nStephen A Smith We liked Serial-Sayer-of-Stupid-Shit Stephen A. Smith (that\u2019s his official title) before he started building his collection of I\u2019m-smarter-than-you-stupid-niggas idiotic quotes and hyperbolic synonyms. Stephen is one of those people who thinks that intelligence is determined by the number of syllables he can cram into a sentence. First it was his statement that some women get their asses beat because they provoke men. Then it was his Cosby-esque defense of Martin O\u2019Malley and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d by pointing the finger at Black people. He finally hit an all time low when Kevin Durant called him out for blatantly lying, and Smith\u2019s only defense was to threaten Durant on live TV. Black people took that offense like when a bully picks on the quiet kid in class: Why is he picking on KD? You know Kevin don\u2019t bother nobody, so Black people don\u2019t fuck with Stephen A. Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaven Symone - Raven\u2019s ghetto pass was actually revoked in 2014 when she told Oprah that she wasn\u2019t Black or African American, but we kinda let her slide because she was Olivia on the Cosby show, she hung with Mr. Cooper and she was so Raven. We gave her the \u201cGreat Value\u201d brand version of the benefit of the doubt we gave Cosby for forming so many of our childhood memories, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. We had our collective side-eye watching and waiting for her to \u2014 in the words of her very own father \u2014 say \u201csome dumb shit\u201d and she didn\u2019t disappoint. After saying she would discriminate against someone who had a \u201cBlack name\u201d and then defending the news anchor who said Michelle Obama looked like an ape, we crossed her off the list of friends who can come to the cookout, and the list of people we fuck with.\n\nBen Carson - Remember when Cuba Gooding, Jr. \u2014 another dude we sorta don\u2019t fuck with - played Ben Carson in Gifted Hands and Carson became Black History trivia? We liked the soft-spoken medical genius then, but we didn\u2019t know Ben was a right-wing conservative who went around trying to stab people in the dick while concocting theories about the pyramids being built by historical Jews as self-rising flour. Ben\u2019s litany of falsehoods have been well-catalogued, but after Ben tried to convince us that free health care is worse than slavery and that he saved white people during the 1968 race riots, we left Ben alone.

But I took the plunge to use pure glitter on my face and owned it when I met Joy Lorraine, black female entrepreneur, makeup unicorn and owner of Joy Lorraine Cosmetics.\n\nI spotted her, like a beacon, across the floor of the massive convention hall of the International Beauty Show, in all her glittering glory. Decked out in rainbow-glitter eye shadow from brow bones to cheekbones, ruby-red glitter on her lips and sparkling golden skin crowned with a red Afro wig, Lorraine was a vision of the exuberance and joy of playing with makeup.\n\nOn the regular, I prefer to keep people guessing as to whether I\u2019m wearing makeup or not, but fashion\u2019s current mood is encouraging all of us to update our makeup routines and shine bright like a diamond.\n\nIt\u2019s easier than ever to go out on a limb with glitter\u2014and to actually get it right\u2014using all of the newly formulated pigments and kits put together to keep your sparkle in place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVeronica Webb (WebbOnTheFly.com) WebbOnTheFly.com 1 / 2\n\nThe Joy Lorraine Cosmetics glitter lip uses three products to set you up for success: a liquid lipstick ($10.80), adhesive ($13) and pot of cosmetic-grade glitter ($9).

Michael Bongiovanni and former Master Police Officer Robert McDonald in the brutal beating of 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins during a traffic stop, WGCL-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollins was left with a bloodied, bruised face following the incident, which was caught on camera. Bongiovanni, who is accused of pointing a gun at Hollins, burning him with a Taser and lying about him resisting arrest, is also facing charges of battery, while McDonald, who was seen running up to Hollins, only to kick him in the face while he was handcuffed, is being charged with aggravated assault, battery and false writings.\n\nBetween the two of them, they were slapped with a 10-count indictment.\n\nHollins\u2019 attorney, Justin Miller, said that the indictment was a good start, but he is still getting ready for trial, as both officers are expected to plead not guilty to the charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know that these two are bad, and we don\u2019t know how many others, so I\u2019m happy there\u2019s a criminal investigation, and they\u2019re going to go to trial so we can see what\u2019s going on,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bongiovanni\u2019s attorney, Mike Puglise, argued that his client did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cBongiovanni, in a split-second, highly intense situation of de-escalating the situation, did everything he was trained to,\u201d Puglise told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast April, cellphone video of Hollins\u2019 treatment started circulating across news stations and social media. In the video, an officer\u2014later identified as Bongiovanni\u2014can be seen pulling Hollins from his vehicle before dragging him to the ground in the middle of the street. The cop can be seen gesturing to the driver, who rolls onto his stomach before his hands are cuffed behind his back.\n\nShortly after, however, another cop (McDonald) is seen running on the scene and stomping Hollins in his head.\n\nHollins was booked at the Gwinnett County Jail after the incident on charges of possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, obstruction of a police officer and several other traffic citations, including driving on a suspended or revoked license, operating a vehicle with suspended or revoked registration, and failure to signal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis mug shot showed his bloodied nose and lips.\n\nThe following day, though, both officers were swiftly terminated. Bongiovanni came under further scrutiny after another video surfaced showing him punching Hollins in the face as Hollins had his hands in the air.\n\nHollins spoke out about his encounter with the officers a week later, admitting that he feared for his life when he saw the officers approach him. Hollins, as it turned out, also recognized Bongiovanni from a previous traffic stop back in August 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gwinnett County solicitor general ultimately tossed out the case against Hollins, along with 88 other cases in which Bongiovanni and McDonald were either principal officers or key witnesses.\n\n", "keywords": ["cops", "incident", "bongiovanni", "black", "georgia", "traffic", "stop", "indicted", "multiple", "seen", "video", "brutal", "charges", "mcdonald", "gwinnett", "hollins", "man", "officers"], "polarity": -0.026587301587301587, "subjectivity": 0.42936507936507934},

Polanco\u2019s Afro-Latina beauty plays loud and proud, as she\u2019s now partnered with legacy brand Dove on the company\u2019s self-esteem-education workshops.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, since founding the initiative in 2004, Dove has become the largest provider of self-esteem education in the world, reaching more young people than any nongovernmental organization, educational institution or government at 20 million and counting. The Glow Up had the pleasure of talking with boundary-breaking actress Polanco at Dove\u2019s latest workshop for teens.\n\nThe Glow Up: You\u2019ve always been outspoken about beauty inequality. Why did you partner with Dove?\n\nDascha Polanco: I\u2019m being very honest with you: I remember when Dove first came out with that billboard\u2014all the women wearing full briefs. I\u2019m a full-brief kind of girl, you know what I mean? When I saw Dove embrace real women and real bodies, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where brands need to be headed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I learned that they\u2019ve partnered with Shonda Rhimes on self-esteem-education workshops and that they\u2019ve helped over 20 million young girls to have a positive relationship with themselves and self-esteem and body confidence, it was something that I wanted to be part of.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the goal?\n\nDP: Allowing this new generation to enter positions of power with open minds. We are teaching them to be willing to look beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to think is right or what\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Can you share ways that you lift your own self-esteem?\n\nDP: It\u2019s very important to have gender equality in my household [so] that things are done across the board\u2014not because you\u2019re a boy, not because you\u2019re a girl\u2014but because you\u2019re both equally valuable. You both have the capacity, the ability, to go far farther than me, beyond me\u2014your opportunities are limitless. Whenever I feel like I have a positive impact, I can bring my daughter to the Dove self-esteem workshops and she can learn from these resources.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do people have to go in person to the workshop?\n\nDP: Dove has the resources on the website. They also have parenting courses about how self-esteem starts in the home. When you look at studies of bullying in school, depression and suicidal behaviors have gone up because of not paying attention to the real issues affecting the youth. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids. Stand in front of the mirror and say \u201cI am powerful,\u201d \u201cI am beautiful,\u201d \u201cI am smart,\u201d \u201cI can do anything.\u201d Make mood boards. I tell my kids: \u201cWrite a list of everything you want to do. What do you want to be when you grow up? How do you see yourself in the next couple years? What are a couple of goals within the next month to get you there?\u201d\n\nAnd I do that with my daughter. I\u2019m in [a] constant battle with my daughter Dasany, who doesn\u2019t leave the house without her eyebrows painted on. She has eyebrows, but they\u2019re light eyebrows and I\u2019m like, \u201cGirl!\u201d I try to emphasize that with her beautiful skin right now, she doesn\u2019t need anything. I do whatever I can to make a positive impact, like bringing my daughter to this workshop with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about words and what they hear; words penetrate your children so much. Sometimes, to compensate for the time that we don\u2019t get to spend with them, we\u2019re like, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping,\u201d or some other materialistic thing. [But] you\u2019ll be surprised how much spending an hour talking with your kids changes them.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nTGU: And the conversation we have with ourselves?\n\nDP: We are focused ourselves on what is negative without truly having taken the moment to acknowledge our own external differences\u2014wanting to be approved of, wanting to be accepted.

Customer demand for high-quality products with a luxury feel aimed at a black and brown audience\u2014ticketed at drugstore price points\u2014has been pent up for decades. This is in response to shifting demographics as much as customer needs; by 2028, the majority of Americans 18-25 years old will be people of color for the first time in history.\n\nThe flood of affordable, accessible and increasingly natural products aimed at black and brown consumers shows no signs of slowing on Target\u2019s shelves. This month, cult favorite the Lip Bar, founded by Detroiter and former financial analyst Melissa Butler, joined Target\u2019s roster of in-store offerings.\n\nThe Lip Bar\u2019s range of vegan, cruelty-free, deeply pigmented liquid lipsticks is just the latest high-quality, for-us, by-us product to land a spot next to cornerstone brands in the ethnic category, like Carol\u2019s Daughter (now owned by L\u2019Oreal) and Iman cosmetics (now owned by Procter & Gamble), both top sellers since debuting at Target in 2014 and 2012, respectively.\n\nAt press time, I counted 17 black-owned brands available at Target. Fourteen out of those 17 lines were natural-product ranges, a fact that reflects the growing concern among women in our community about moving away from chemical agents in our beauty routines, in everything from natural-hair products to lipstick to body lotions.\n\nIn conversation with The Glow Up, Melissa Butler says frankly, \u201cI am not passionate about makeup.\u201d Rather, she is passionate \u201cabout changing the narrative around the way black women are sold cosmetics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Butler realized was that no one was answering the question for the robust customer base buying natural-hair-care products as to where they could also buy natural or organic makeup brands.\n\nButler took a nontraditional route to sell her products to the popular big-box chain. With nerves and business acumen developed as a former Wall Street financial analyst, she contacted Target\u2019s cosmetics buyer directly. Big conglomerates control the color-cosmetics aisles; it\u2019s a near impossible feat for independent brands to get distribution without the backing of a L\u2019Oreal or a Procter & Gamble (backing Carol\u2019s Daughter and Iman, respectively) secured as an aid to initial entree into Target.\n\nBut even though Butler went directly to the store\u2019s buyers, there are no shortcuts to the front of the shelf when it comes to a multibillion-dollar retailer like Target. The Lip Bar has been available via Target.com since October 2016, proving itself through \u201cmessaging that sets us apart.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lip Bar speaks to customers through the use of nontraditional models and positive messaging that tells women they are already beautiful.\n\nAs Butler says, \u201cOur lipsticks add to their overall health and beauty, and we offer the highest-quality natural and organic products at about 60 percent less than comparable brands.\u201d\n\nPhoto: TheDoux.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtney Foster, a spokesperson for Target, spoke to The Glow Up about the growing family of brands directed at an ethnic audience, not all of which are wholly black-owned: \u201cThis winter, we launched more than 10 new brands, including the Lip Bar, the Doux, Urban RX and Koils by Nature, bringing our total multicultural beauty assortment to more than 100 brands.\u201d\n\nHow much is this market worth to Target\u2019s bottom line? Foster says, \u201cThough we cannot disclose sales information, we will continue to invest in our multicultural offerings and grow our assortment to include offerings that we believe will resonate with our guests.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated $46 billion beauty market in the U.S., of which black women account for roughly 22 percent of the total spend, that sales number has to be quite significant. Target is the third-largest retailer in the world, with 1,822 stores in the U.S. alone, as well as online sales, and a continued commitment to pledging 5 percent of net profits to charities based in the communities served by the retailer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is good news for the black-owned brands populating Target\u2019s inventory, as well as for our communities, as it has enormous potential to create positive cash flow back into communities of color.\n\nOf the 10 newly launched brands, there are a few standouts for us here at The Glow Up: The Doux, a natural-hair-care brand based on old-school hip-hop aesthetics is the definition of funky-fresh packaging\u2014Bonita Afro Balm, anyone?

And it\u2019ll continue long after the ongoing crisis ends.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the new Netflix docuseries Flint Town coming out Friday. The eight-episode show has little to do with the water crisis that left the predominantly black city of nearly 100,000 exposed to lead poisoning\u2014yet, at the same time, it has everything to do with it. And it\u2019s necessary viewing for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist or ally to the environmental justice movement, in particular.\n\nThe cinematic show follows the actual Flint Police Department, an underfunded public service agency (like most others in the city), from 2015 to 2017. The riveting high-speed ride-alongs\u2014which include calls to murder scenes or drug busts\u2014give the viewer an exclusive look into the world of policing and, more importantly, the humans who make it up.\n\nA handful of the 98 officers who make up the police department\u2014the smallest number of officers to police any city of a comparable size in the United States\u2014afford directors Zackary Canepari, Drea Cooper, and Jessica Dimmock an intimate view of their lives. This story steps away from the one-dimensional view of law enforcement we\u2019ve all become accustomed to seeing in TV dramas and media coverage, offering something real and raw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s any of this got to do with the environment?\n\nThe docuseries shows\u2014quite incredibly\u2014how an environmental crisis like Flint\u2019s exacerbates already perilous situations in communities home to people of color and low-income families. Things were bad in Flint long before its water wasn\u2019t drinkable: Poverty has overwhelmed the community since 2000 when General Motors closed its car factory. And as Flint Town makes painfully clear, crime is everywhere.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this series shows us that environmental crises are never the only issue with which vulnerable communities have to deal. Years and sometimes decades of social ills compound to create the structure that allows these kinds of catastrophes to happen in the first place. The docuseries provides the important context to understand the ripple effects contaminated water had on the city and its residents. Residents no longer trusted anyone, including the police department. After all, city officials knew lead was in the water and failed to do anything for months and months.\n\nOfficers are forced to police under a veil of distrust while grappling with the ways the water crisis has impacted them, too. \u201cThere are a lot of officers living in Flint,\u201d said director Jessica Dimmock to Earther. \u201cAt the end of the day, they come into the station. They can\u2019t drink the water there. They\u2019re surrounded by water bottles. [The water crisis] is never far from their minds.\u201d\n\nWater bottles are always lingering in the background of this Netflix show. \u201cThat was intentional and also unavoidable,\u201d said Dummock. \u201cOnce your eyes become aware of it, you see [bottles] everywhere.\u201d It can be as subtle as a plastic water bottle near the kitchen sink or as clear as the packages and packages of water bottles sitting in the Flint Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Town not only offers stunning visuals, but it offers a real glimpse of what it\u2019s like to live and serve this community, challenging the stereotypical narrative around environmental justice. The movement was born out of a North Carolina black community fighting for the right to clean roadways. Today, it can mean a lot more.\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nSome scholars have been challenging what we define as our \u201cenvironment.\u201d Is it just the air we breathe? Or can it also include the stressful environment in which a person lives when police don\u2019t arrive at an emergency, or when a mother is worried about making the water pick-up deadline after working a 12-hour shift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll those environmental factors contribute and play off of one another,\u201d said director Drea Cooper to Earther. \u201cYou definitely see some of that through the series.\u201d\n\nSo though this show isn\u2019t about the Flint water crisis, I urge you to watch it. It\u2019s no Planet Earth or scientific expos\u00e9 of how lead leaches into waterways. It\u2019s an honest attempt to tell the story of a city and a group of people who refuse to give up on it.", "keywords": ["city", "environmental", "lead", "crisis", "bottles", "flint", "town", "water", "netflix", "need", "officers", "long", "series", "watch"], "polarity": 0.06625319125319126, "subjectivity": 0.5150795963295963},

On May 17, a coalition of law-enforcement officers, attorneys and community officials formed a super PAC dedicated to ousting Mosby from her position as Baltimore City state\u2019s attorney, according to the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the position is not typically the focus of a highly funded political race, the June 2018 Democratic primary is shaping up to be a heated contest. In Maryland, a super PAC can accept unlimited funds from corporations, unions and individuals, and the group has already released an attack ad against Mosby\u2014even though she has no opponent.\n\nAlso, in May, a federal appeals court put on hold a lawsuit accusing Mosby of malicious prosecution, defamation and invasion of privacy against three of the officers who faced charges in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, whose demise sparked riots throughout the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early June, a U.S. District Court unsealed a lawsuit by two more officers in the case who charge that they were arrested illegally for the death of Gray.\n\nMosby\u2019s critics allege that she was overzealous in prosecuting the police officers who faced trial on charges of killing Gray, who died after being found badly injured in the back of a police vehicle following a 2015 arrest. They accuse her of defaming their names and conducting a secret investigation. They even say that Mosby filed charges that were harsher than the crimes committed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGo back and read the previous paragraph and replace the word \u201cpolice\u201d with any black-sounding name and notice how unremarkable that statement seems. In other words, they are angry at Mosby for treating cops with the same biased, heavy-handed one-sidedness with which police officers treat black suspects every day.\n\nOne of the reasons only five white police officers have been convicted of killing a black man in the last 13 years is that the law is technically on their side. The city, district and state\u2019s attorneys responsible for prosecuting officers charged with crimes are the same lawyers who work hand in hand with the police on a daily basis. They depend on cops to gather evidence, investigate crimes and testify in court cases against criminals. They support the police unions. Cops and state\u2019s attorneys work under the umbrella of the same employers and are essentially teammates, so it is naive to expect prosecutors to pursue justice against police officers with any impartial vigor.\n\nBut Mosby bucked that system when she filed 28 charges, ranging from false imprisonment to second-degree murder, against six officers whose actions she believed led to Gray\u2019s demise. Since then, she\u2019s been a target for the people who believe that police are infallible and suggest that anyone who says otherwise in an un-American criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with The Atlantic, David Jaros, an associate professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, suggested that Mosby\u2019s actions were consistent with how the justice system routinely treats most suspects, saying:\n\nI love how surprised people are by the fact that a prosecutor may have overcharged. This is something prosecutors do all the time, as a strategic choice, for various reasons, and it\u2019s ironic that suddenly the [Fraternal Order of Police] is up in arms over this. What\u2019s surprising is that we see a criminal-justice system moving rapidly to respond to allegations of police misconduct... If anything, the overwhelming concern is that prosecutors and the police work together every day. There was considerable concern about whether the prosecutor in Ferguson [Mo.] was vigorously pursuing the police officer in that case and whether there were divided loyalties. In cases where the process seems to have moved more slowly, I think the question has to come up of why are those cases moving much slower than other cases that the prosecutor\u2019s office takes on. But certainly there are reasons for us to think that we need institutions other than the police to be investigating and policing the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the cops\u2019 lawsuit against Mosby is that she conducted her own investigation outside of the Baltimore Police Department instead of letting the police look into Gray\u2019s death, which would have been as unthinkably stupid as asking Republican senators to investigate whether a Republican senator and a Republican president are guilty of colluding with ... wait. That\u2019s probably a bad example. They actually did that.\n\nOne of the grievances the super PAC leveled against Mosby is Baltimore\u2019s rising crime rate. Yes, you heard that right\u2014a group that includes police officers and the police union is trying to blame the crime rate on the state\u2019s attorney. This, in spite of a Justice Department probe that shows Baltimore police officers target blacks, arrest people without probable cause and sometimes don\u2019t even show up to court. They blame her despite the numerous studies here and here (pdf) that show conviction rates have little to no effect on crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficers William Porter, Alicia White and Brian Rice are suing for malicious prosecution\u2014the theory that Mosby went after them without probable cause for reasons other than justice. They are also suing for defamation, invasion of privacy and violations of their civil rights\u2014a list of charges that sounds exactly like what was done to Gray when law-enforcement officials violated his civil rights, chasing him down and arresting him without probable cause.\n\nThe officers\u2019 defamation claim mirrors what police did to Michael Brown\u2014creating the narrative of the hulking convenience store robber minutes after Officer Darren Wilson felled him in Ferguson, Mo. The cops do not think Mosby should have secretly obtained warrants to search their cellphone records, as the Minnesota police officers did to Diamond Reynolds the day after she watched an officer kill Philando Castile in her car in Falcon Heights, Minn.\n\nOfficers Edward Nero and Garnett Miller say they \u201clost their freedom and dignity and suffered physical and psychological harm from being arrested and detained without cause,\u201d and therefore they are entitled to damages, according to their recently unsealed lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... you can do that?\n\nTo be fair, being arrested and detained without cause can cause one to lose one\u2019s freedom and dignity and suffer \u201cpsychological harm.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Freddie Gray, who was arrested and detained without cause, would only wish that freedom and dignity were the only things he lost. Go ahead and ask him. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is clear that Marilyn Mosby is being attacked from all sides because Mosby treated Baltimore cops the way Baltimore cops treat everyone else\u2014and Mosby should know. Her mother was on the police force, as were her father and her uncle next door to her childhood home.\n\n\n\nBefore the Justice Department even released its report on the Baltimore Police Department, Mosby probably knew from working with them every day that:\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, prosecutors and booking officers declined to book more than 11,000 arrests\u2014usually because the arrest was unjustified or without probable cause.\n\n\n\nNinety-five percent of Baltimoreans stopped more than 10 times by the police during that time period were black.\n\n\n\nThe BPD regularly failed to investigate or respond to sexual assault.\n\n\n\nThe department regularly used excessive force.\n\n\n\nMaybe Mosby\u2019s detractors will win. Perhaps a judge will somehow allow the plaintiffs to sue a prosecutor for performing her job of prosecuting. Maybe she really is a little too caught up in the \u201cjustice\u201d part of the criminal-justice system and too willing to disregard the color of the uniforms when it comes to pursuing criminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the old Looney Tunes cartoons, Bugs Bunny was always the hunted. He spent most of his time evading the devilish, gun-slinging Yosemite Sam and the bumbling, shotgun-toting Elmer Fudd. But whenever the tables turned\u2014as they always did\u2014instead of being repentant, Bugs\u2019 archenemies instead would try to weasel their way out of trouble. Yosemite Sam would get so mad, puffs of smoke came out of his ears. Fudd\u2019s stutter would become even worse in his anger.\n\nThe people coming for Marilyn Mosby have been unapologetically hunting the citizens of Baltimore since long before Mosby ever appeared on the radar. But ever since she decided that she wouldn\u2019t give cops a free pass to do whatever they want to whomever they want with impunity, you can see the smoke coming out of the cartoon villains\u2019 ears and hear them stuttering at the top of their lungs because now they know:\n\nIt ain\u2019t no fun when the rabbit got the gun.\n\nRead more at the Baltimore Sun.", "keywords": ["coming", "treat", "cops", "justice", "department", "mosby", "cause", "prosecutors", "theyre", "baltimore", "marilyn", "charges", "system", "officers", "way", "treated"], "polarity": 0.016086565210276557, "subjectivity": 0.4438498042621755},

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos, like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered,\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Aina a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u201cdon\u2019t look good on you\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u201d I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u201cshe doesn\u2019t work very hard because she doesn\u2019t have to\u201d; [it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Aina is no stranger to hard work. She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black, they see mass-market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences, we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian, and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, she actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Aina has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but also to learn what\u2019s on the market and to get further inspiration about what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nIn February 2018, Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She told us: \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup.

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

Last week, in a piece I wrote for EBONY, I stated that Meek Mill has absolutely no chance to win this beef with Drake. Mainly because he just does not have the particular skillset necessary for this type of battle.\n\n\n\nMeek Mill\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s just not equipped with the skills necessary to succeed with this. Although he became popular through battle rapping\u2026 he wasn\u2019t actually particularly good at it. He\u2019s not particularly clever or witty; he doesn\u2019t have particularly humorous punchlines; and no one in the history of history has ever raved about a Mill metaphor. He spits drug/murder bars. And often sounds like he\u2019s trying to speak to someone while a blender is running. On a helicopter. Which is great for the type of Scream Trap Rap he creates. He\u2019ll always get play in strip clubs and on crossfit playlists. But, if attempting to go head-to-head with the current king of the hip-hop hill, you need more than murder bars. So now he\u2019s in an unwinnable feud where everyone\u2014even those on his side\u2014is aware it\u2019s an unwinnable feud. The only way for him to beat Drake at this point would be to literally beat Drake up.\n\nThis was (partially) false. It is true that Meek Mill doesn't have the facility or lyrical ingenuity to compete here. He is, to put it plainly, overmatched. But that's the thing. He's so overmatched, so out of his range, and so thoroughly defeated at this point that Drake continuing to mount an offense against him can \u2014 and, likely, will \u2014 backfire on him. Because when you're up 70 points in the third quarter, you call off the full-court press. Even if your crowd is still cheering for every basket. Because the type of people still cheering for you when you're up 70 and still pressing are the exact same people who'll cheer for the other team if you ever happen to be down 70.\n\nBasically, you don't do what Drake did at the OVO Fest.\n\nI get it, though. Meek Mill barked up the wrong tree. And that sound we're hearing is a thousand trees falling on him. Will Smith teleportated from Venus to take part in the fun. Kanye West fucking smiled! Even Whataburger took a break from hocking bacon-wrapped skunk meat to join in. And the expiration date on his relationship with Nicki Minaj just went from \"raw meat still in the fridge\" to \"raw meat on the sidewalk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, knowing the momentum and the zeitgeist is clearly on his side, Drake went full Mean Girl. Coming out to \"Back to Back\", trolling Meek with t-shirts, and teasing him with an endless stream of memes. Of course, we (myself included) lapped it up. Because, while petty, some of that shit was funny. But there's a very particular type of arrogance that cultivates and is cultivated by that type of performative overkill; the type of arrogance that leads someone to believe they're truly untouchable. Truly unfuckwitable.\n\nAnd yes, that was overkill. With the release of \"Back to Back\" \u2014 and the reception it received \u2014 and Meek Mill's release of \"Wanna Know\" \u2014 and the reception that received, Drake had won already. Meek Mill was done. Dead. And now Drake is riding the wind and peeing on his corpse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut winds eventually shift. They always do. And when they do, that same pee might splash you in the face.

All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

Dre doesn\u2019t have to die, but I wish we could fast-forward to the part of the story where he realizes he needs to get on the winning team and stop swinging from Kanan like it\u2019s recess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould he die? No, but pick a side, beloved.\n\nKanan\n\nSo maybe 50 Cent is not the Negro League Steven Seagal. I say that because while he can be as great a pest as he is a charmer, on this show, he is exceptional at making me loathe every word that flies out of his mouth. Granted, he has every right to be mad at Ghost, but I still wish he hadn\u2019t survived that fire as if he\u2019s black Fire Marshall Bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis man killed his own son despite being an absent and overall terrible father. Who does that? This sum\u2019bitch, that\u2019s who. I hate Kanan. I hate his lesbian cousin cop (played wonderfully by Anika Noni Rose). I hate his friends. I hate all of their scenes. I just hate him. Hate. Hate. Hate. I hate him like I hate a Minute Maid Mao morning tweet.\n\nShould he die? Well, I thought he was dead already, so yes. Hell, die slow this time, Kanan.\n\nJames \u201cGhost\u201d St. Patrick\n\nYou can appreciate someone\u2019s sex scenes and find him a ridiculous thot all the same. Ghost is a self-absorbed asshole who fancies himself a nicer guy than he actually is. He doesn\u2019t respect Tommy, who deserves more credit as both a fellow drug dealer and a wearer of amazing outerwear. He doesn\u2019t truly value Tasha, who has stood by him this entire time and who seems more committed to the life he chose than even he is. As a father, he\u2019s not bad, but he was totally out of line trying to force his kids to get along with his high school sweetheart-turned-sidepiece-turned fake-ass stepmama way too soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd everyone around him told him to keep away from Angela, but did he listen? No. And the nerve of him to take money from the accounts he shared with his wife to go launch a legitimate business he can\u2019t even enjoy because he just got arrested for murder\u2014by his lil\u2019 ex-boo, no less.\n\nShould he die? No, because that would end the show. Even so, Tasha should curse him out at least seven more times. I almost wish Tasha took over the \u201cother\u201d business with Tommy, though. She can be just as ruthless as Ghost, if not more so.\n\nTariq St. Patrick\n\nSo this was hard for me. I agree with Panama Jackson that just about everyone on this show is garbage besides Tommy and Tasha. Still, in terms of who I hate most, it\u2019s really neck and neck for me between Tariq and Angela. Like, I understand that Tariq is a kid, but this is one stupid-ass child. All of that money spent on private school, and this dimwitted motherfucking brat never learned not to talk to strangers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd did y\u2019all see the season premiere? Stupid little boy, you fell for Kanan again? Tariq is disrespectful to his dad, mom and sister. He is the worst kind of fool in that he is a spoiled, privileged brat who has absolutely no idea how good he has it. He\u2019s also a fake-ass thug. I\u2019m sorry your dad doesn\u2019t always communicate with you as he should. In some respects, that explains in part why Tariq is such an obnoxious teenager. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t excuse how he\u2019s been the weak link in the family since this show started. Even his sister, who barely speaks, is stronger than he is.\n\nShould he die? I mean, I wouldn\u2019t care if he did, but he can\u2019t die until he fully realizes what a petty, disrespectful, dishonest ingrate he is. That and he\u2019s been wasting time trying to find something in strangers that he already has in a dad (who at least has tried to become closer to his ditzy self). I hate this child.\n\nAngela \u201cAngie\u201d Valdez\n\nLet\u2019s just get this out of the way now: If Angie dies, awesome, but I actually wouldn\u2019t mind her staying alive, if only to see her character suffer with the realization that Ghost didn\u2019t off her on-again, off-again creepy-ass boyfriend. What I hate most about Angela is her sanctimony. One, you\u2019re messing with a married man. Two, you\u2019re messing with a married man who you realize is selling drugs. Three, you continue to sleep with a married man after you find out what he really does, after convincing yourself that it\u2019s OK because he\u2019s going to leave his wife and start going legit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeloved, people can change, but when you enter a situation that messy, you\u2019re going to be met with the consequences of the chaos you created. You also lose them how you got them, you self-righteous, hypocritical thot.\n\nThen there is the fact that in her own career as an FBI agent, she bends the rules if not flat-out breaks the law, yet somehow always manages to justify it by some moral metric that shifts as she sees fit. And can we just talk about how bad she is at her job in general? Yeah, girl, you\u2019ve got the gift of sniffing up dirt, but you don\u2019t exactly know how to get tangible results in terms of convictions.\n\nWhat kind of federal prosecutor behaves like this? I guess the kind who keeps a loaded gun around her married boyfriend\u2019s stupid-ass, nosy child. As for how the last season ended, whew, I wish Tasha would pistol-whip this raggedy-ass woman. She is a vindictive, manipulative, hypocritical asshole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she found out that Jamie was Ghost, she made a choice, but she refuses to acknowledge that. Now, because things didn\u2019t turn out how she wanted, she wants to have Ghost be found guilty of a murder he didn\u2019t commit in order to avenge the obsessive weirdo she only started smashing again to save her own ass.\n\nI hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nYes, I needed to type \u201cI hate her\u201d that many times. She\u2019s worth hating that much.

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

Because of normal administrative turnover and term expirations, all seats on the board have been vacant since Catherine Pugh took over as mayor, and City Paper reports that it may be a while before new members are put in place.\n\nThere are already screened applications sitting in the mayor\u2019s office for review. Jill Carter, director of the Office of Civil Rights and Wage Enforcement, told City Paper that her office screened the applications and made recommendations for new members to Pugh\u2019s office about a month ago.

I submitted it, it was reviewed, and Jill sent her decisions to the mayor,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cSomeone in Bloc was told that everything was on hold pending the consent decree. When that was signed, the mayor decided to completely relaunch and reformat how the mayor\u2019s office operates.\u201d He was busy and didn\u2019t have time to make the other deadline, though three other Bloc members did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an email to City Paper, Anthony McCarthy, communications director for Pugh, said that there is \u201cno delay,\u201d but this process takes a long time. He said the Civilian Review Board is a priority for the mayor, and the goal is to name new members before the next meeting.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t leave the mayor\u2019s office much time.

Turns out it\u2019s not as hard to make a woman happy as you might think\u2014we want more beauty in our lives! (And cash, but that\u2019s another story.) From twinkling eye shadows to top facial treatments, here are my top five recommended treats that will make someone you love feel like a star when she finds them under the tree!\n\n1. Eye Shadow Palettes\n\nWhen it comes to dazzling color that\u2019s easy to wear for the holiday season, the eyes have it. Personally, I love long-wearing shades and a lot of variety\u2014it adds up to a lot of options at a nice price. This is a cute video on how to use one of my favorite palettes from ColourPop, available for $30.\n\n2. Serum\n\nEveryone loves a serum\u2014or they should\u2014because those precious elixirs slide into your skin\u2019s thirsty pores like a saving grace. In fact, if you haven\u2019t already, try this beauty hack: Mix in a serum to customize any brand of liquid or cream foundation. Not only does it make controlling the application easier by blending together the foundation\u2019s suspension base of water, oil or silicone and pigment more throughly than just shaking the bottle, but it also turns your makeup into a treatment for your face.\n\nMy latest fave is SkinCeuticals B5 Serum ($82). Oil-free formulas are your best bet when it comes to making sure your foundation doesn\u2019t jailbreak itself from the serum in a mere few hours, since oil-based and water-based products don\u2019t mix. You ever notice makeup that looks like it\u2019s separating or melting? That\u2019s why. This gel formula nourishes with hyaluronic acid, which is the body\u2019s natural defense against dehydration.\n\n3. Night Cream\n\nWhen I turn the lights out at night, I say, \u201cMake it rain!\u201d I\u2019m a believer in slathering on night cream and waking up looking like a daisy. Knowing what kind of skin you have\u2014oily, dry, normal or combo\u2014dictates what you need to feed your face. Dr. Shirley Madhere, a New York City-based holistic plastic surgeon, advises that nighttime is the \u201coptimal moment for the skin to regenerate.\u201d In her opinion, there are three primary modes of regeneration, and these are the corresponding ingredients that maximize results:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepair with antioxidants: I like Herbivore\u2019s Moon Fruit Superfruit Night Treatment ($58).\n\nProtect with refined essential oils, like those found in Acure Organics Seriously Glowing Facial Serum ($19.99).\n\nHydrate: Hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers work to rehydrate the skin on a cellular level, restoring plumpness and luminosity, like Tata Harper\u2019s Illuminating Moisturizer ($105). This organic product has diamond dust in it and can be mixed into foundation for more radiance, or layered on top for strobing. Or bring out the RiRi in you, and shine bright like a diamond even when you wear it to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Face Masks\n\nOnce a week, take it all off. Winter weather and holiday parties kill your skin. Between the layers of dry skin building up from freezing temperatures outside and dry heat inside and the harsh effects of holiday cocktails and lipid-zapping party food, your pores are like microscopic firehoses trying to shoot out toxins as fast as they can.\n\nBottoms up! Sheet masks are a great way to get your drink on for thirsty skin in need of tightening, plumping or hydrating. Dr. Jart\u2019s Rubber Mask series\u2014besides it\u2019s totally intriguing packaging\u2014is not as Westworld as it looks. The combination of slippery red algae and calcium is cold to the touch and feels super sleek and sexy on the skin. And at $12 per mask, there\u2019s something for everyone!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the very affordable Dr. Jart masks above, Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained dermatologist and plastic surgeon, shared her list of favorite masks: SK-II Facial Treatment masks ($95-$135) and Sisley Black Rose Mask ($89) are her top picks for hydration during long-haul flights, and Cle de Peau\u2019s Intensive Brightening Mask helps fight hyperpigmentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Facial Devices\n\nGet lifted! I can tell you firsthand that micro-current technology works to tighten and lift your skin. I\u2019ve paid fortunes for micro-current treatments at corner nail salons and five-star spas alike, because they work. When these handheld devices came to the market for home use four years ago, I was first in line, and I still use mine weekly to tighten and lift my face and neck and smooth my forehead.\n\nThe mild electric current that passes through the silver orbs, conducted though a layer of ultrasound jelly (or even aloe vera, if you\u2019re on a budget), is like an elliptical machine for facial muscles. The current can sting slightly\u2014especially where skin tends to be thinner around the brow bone and under the eyes, while there\u2019s almost no sensation on the cheeks, neck and jawline. But a little discomfort is worth it in the under-eye area, where micro-currents do wonders to get rid of dark circles and puffiness in minutes by increasing circulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe devices, which are cordless and FDA approved, range in price from to $20 to $200, meaning that everyone can afford to get in the game.

She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible. Considering that many officers can go entire 30-year careers without anyone shooting at them, is it possible that Macioce is just unfathomably unlucky? Yes, that is possible.\n\nRegardless of the possibilities, it\u2019s definitely true that violence keeps finding Gino Macioce. Or perhaps violence doesn\u2019t have to look that hard because Macioce keeps looking for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since it\u2019s true that each man Macioce shot was black, it\u2019s also possible that Gino Macioce just keeps finding reasons to shoot black people.", "keywords": ["shot", "black", "macioce", "officer", "scene", "cop", "shootings", "officers", "shoots", "possible", "pittsburgh", "daniels", "kills", "yes"], "polarity": 0.004166666666666665, "subjectivity": 0.53671875},

The police have currently not determined if she boarded her normal Maryland Transit Administration bus or got a ride, police spokesperson T.J. Smith said at a news conference, according to the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe does not have a sense of discernment like you and I, and I don\u2019t think she believes she\u2019s in danger, but she really is,\u201d Kennedi\u2019s mother, Brandi Stallings, said at the press conference. \u201cWhoever has her, I kindly ask that you please, please bring her back home, drop her off at a police station, just put her somewhere safe.\u201d\n\nSmith said that the teen\u2019s disappearance has raised eyebrows in the Special Investigations Division, since Kennedi is not known for going missing for any extended period of time, \u201cand certainly not overnight without having any type of contact with her mother.\u201d\n\nHer mother said that prior to her disappearance, the teen had been acting normally and that no issues had come up at home that could have prompted her to run away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice did search Edgecomb Park, which is about 2 miles away from Kennedi\u2019s school, but didn\u2019t find her.\n\nSome in social media have pulled up Snapchats that have allegedly been sent from Kennedi\u2019s account, saying that somehow the teen is in Mountain View, Calif., Smith said. Baltimore police reached out to the Mountain View Police Department, which investigated the angle and eventually debunked it.\n\nKennedi does not have a phone, Smith said, and airline representatives have no records of her boarding a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe think local is more likely,\u201d Smith added.\n\nPolice also said that so far there has been no indication of abduction or foul play.

Not only is Drake winning right now, Meek Mill is actively losing. \"Baby lotion soft\"? That's the best you have? Come on Meek. These niggas churn out trash songs at an alarmingly fast clip, but we're four days later and the best we have is some tweets from Meek and words on stage at his girl's tour? Come on, man. Meek\u2026you lookin' real baby lotion soft right now. This niggas spends the better part of his days yelling at everybody but now we hear nothing. You're losing, gawd. Amen.\n\n2. \"Back To Back\" is some kind of disrespectful. Drake, you a rude nigga, my nigga. The cover art is the famous picture of Joe Carter hitting the game-winning homerun to lift the Toronto Blue Jays over the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, giving them their back-to-back World Series titles after having won in 1992. Can we just talk about how rude that shit is? Drake\u2026you are a rude nigga.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI respect it. THAT's how you kick off a dis record, shading a motherfucker before a word is even uttered. I like this move. A lot.\n\n3. The Funk Flex debacle...Meek, if you ain't have a track ready, DON'T LET THE MOUTH OF NEW YORK amp that shit up. Now you just look slow and, dare I say, not like a boss. Rick Ross cannot be happy about this right now. I hate Flex anyway so shit like this just adds fuel to the \"Flex must go\" fire. Quit making yourself a story, b.\n\n4. Quentin Miller was very smart with this tumblr post about the \"ghostwriting\" accusations. You do not bite the hand that feeds you, especially when that hand can probably feed you for the next ten years. Easy money, b. Easy money. Shit, if I was Quentin Miller, I'd have said, \"that \"10 Bands\" reference was me taking my shot at reciting Drake's words but I realized I wasn't as good. I thought I deleted it but somebody got a hold to it and here we are. Fuck whoever did that.\" Barry Bonds ain't never gonna see the inside of a jail because his peoples are loyal as fuck. Bond's folks are going to prison for him because they know when they get out\u2026they good money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith 10 bands, 50 bands, 100 bands fuck it man, let's just not even discuss it man. Don't discuss it indeed.\n\n5. Let's talk about \"Back To Back\". Drake got jokes, y'all. Lots of them. And they're good jokes. But this line right here sums up why Drake wins\u2026\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's REALLY hard to body a super self-aware nigga with a sense of humor about his place in the world, who also happens to be better at what he does than most other people doing it. Drake is on everybody's record because everybody knows that he sells. You turn the Drake record into a single. Period. There ain't no Drake filler records. Nobody gives a shit that Meek Mill dissed somebody\u2026we only cared cuz he went at Drake and folks wanted to see how he'd respond. We're all happy that Drake IS responding musically because we weren't sure how Drake would respond at all. I know now and my life is better. It aint like Drake dropped the illest dis record of all time (though I do think its a good record), it's more like\u2026damn Drake is actually dropping real dis records. We likey.\n\nNobody really cares about Meek's comeback, we're just all glad that Drake cared enough to respond. More Drake records is better for the world. More Meek records\u2026eh\u2026\n\n6. Poor Meek. Stuck between a dude who makes his songs better and his girlfriend who is a good friend of Drake. But Meek is a rapper so he has to come back, but holy fuck he's taking his time. It's 2015\u2026we're losing interest Meek. You've got like 27 hours tops before niggas are over you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The dumbest part about this all is that dissing Drake is just stupid anyway. Drake gon' be alright. Two years from now when Meek Mill is working at Starbucks with Vin Baker, Drake will still be releasing albums and making money. Love him or hate him, the boy is talented as fuck. And he knows it.\n\n8. Similarly, this is how you know Drake really does give a shit about Nicki, he clowned Meek while paying deference to Nicki. Hip hop's track record when it comes to women sucks, when it comes to dis tracks and women in niggas lives, it sucks more. Drake went full Drake and respected Nicki while clowning Meek. Good show, Drake. This is why women will continue to support you, beard or no beard.\n\n9. \"Shout out to the boss bitches wifin' niggas\" ~ So disrespectful. But so hilarious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I am curious to what Meek is going to come back with. I'm sure it will be a vitriolic dis, where he spews lines about how pussy Drake is and how soft he is and all that shit. Ya know, the things Drake gets clowned on via Twitter daily. And yet Drake is out here winning anyway. I'm not saying Drake is teflon, but most of these niggas out here ain't dumb enough to go at a dude who can 1) actually spit (fuck what ya heard); and 2) get on one of their records and introduce them to the charts. I'm not much of a Meek Mill fan anyway. He's got some hot records obviously. But no Meek Mill in my life isn't really ruining it either. Also, I don't rule out them niggas having a talk somewhere, a moscato summit of sorts, and squashing it for Nicki's sake. But for now, Meek\u2026\n\n\u2026you're on the clock. And the clock is ticking. Bawse.\n\nBONUS:\n\n11. Safaree is probably somewhere smiling his ass off. And by somewhere I mean wondering why he sucks as a rapper. At Starbucks.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["wont", "mother", "mothers", "situation", "korryn", "lives", "gaines", "child", "family", "speaks", "right", "rest", "pain", "hes", "baltimore", "theres", "dormeus"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

In the hour or so I was there, the following points were touched on:\n\nThe importance of whether Drake has a ghostwriter\n\nThis entire feud happening because Meek Mill is feeling insecure because he's fighting above his weight with Nicki Minaj\n\nBirdman's hands (Yeah, I don't know why either)\n\nDarkskinned niggas acting lightskinned\n\nAnd then, someone said something about how this entire feud just proves how soft and wack today's generation is in comparison to \"our generation,\" and brought up Biggie and Pac as evidence. And we all agreed; simultaneously acknowledging that today's young people are some lame-ass, bitch-ass motherfuckers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo cement that point, Biggie's \"Dead Wrong\" is on my Spotify playlist. I listened to it on the way home and marveled at the wordplay as him and Eminem rapped about robbing, raping, and murdering families and livestock. And then I got a little verklempt about the fact that we only had like three years of Biggie music before he died.\n\nAnd then I was like \"Umm, wait a minute, Damon. Before you get all verklempt. Remember, Biggie didn't just DIE. He was killed. As was Tupac. As a result of a rap feud. The type of \"real\" rap feud you were just praising in the shop 10 minutes ago.\"\n\nAnd this brings up another point: Regardless of how wack you think this Mill/Drake beef is and how long you think it'll last, there's no doubt there's like a 0.000000000% chance either of them are going to end up dead because of it. Granted, a thugged out rapper airing grievances on the tweets instead of the streets will never not be weird as fuck. But that's just how these kids today do things. It's awkward, it's lame, it's soft, and it's surreal to witness. But it's also not the worst thing in the world for the most popular rap artists to actually stay alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, that barbershop conversation is one I \u2014 and, I'm assuming, most people reading this \u2014 have had numerous times. Not the Mill/Drake angle, but how much worse this generation is compared to us. (FYI, \"this generation\" = \"anyone under 25.\") But \u2014 and I say this with as much trepidation as possible \u2014 I don't know how true that is. I actually think they might be, gasp, better. Yes. Better.\n\nHow exactly? Let's see.\n\nWe were dumb as fuck in regards to sex. They are less dumb.\n\nAlthough it might seem like young people are becoming more and more sexualized, the reality is that they are making smarter sexual decisions. Teen STD rates have apparently plateaued. Teen pregnancy rates are down. And teens are generally waiting longer to have sex. And their oft-criticized connections to their iPhones and social media might actually be beneficial to their sexual health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom \"Why American teenagers are having much less sex\"\n\n\n\nMore teenagers than ever have smartphones, including those with no traditional computers at home. Many are more comfortable searching in private for credible information about sexual health, she said. They could be better educated about the risks \u2014 and more mentally prepared before that first heated moment ever comes. \u201cThey\u2019re looking on the web,\u201d Bokor said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for guidance from parents, guardians and physicians. They can and will make positive decisions for their own health, both sexual and otherwise. We really need to be prepared to treat our youth and young adults as educated consumers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popular music is considerably less violent. And more diverse.\n\nIn high school, my favorite rappers were Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, Biggie, and Big L. And if you add up the number of people murdered in the songs created by them, you'd have\u2026a lot of dead people. Big L \u2014 who might have been my favorite non-Wu rapper \u2014 had a song were he bragged about killing nuns, being from Hell, and not giving a damn if he caught AIDS\u2026in the same verse! The biggest, most popular rap group my freshman year featured a bunch of niggas from Cleveland singing about ouija boards.\n\nToday's most popular rappers are a Canadian Instagram model, Big Sean (who very well might be an actual infant), J Cole (a college grad), Kendrick Lamar (a straight-A student in high school), an American Idol judge, and Caitlyn Jenner's stepson-in-law. Even the edgier and more street rappers today seem to rap more about taking drugs than selling them. Sure, you have your Chief Keefs and your Bobby Shmurdas, but they seem to be the exceptions now instead of the norms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir clothes are\u2026better\n\nAs much as we lament the popularity of skinny jeans and extra smedium everything, this\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026is better than this\u2026\n\n\u2026and this\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026and this\u2026\n\nThey're better at typing\n\nAs you would have been too if you spent your entire adolescence firing off dozens of texts and tweets per hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir hair is better\n\nI honestly don't know if there's ever been a time when you saw as much variance with Black hairstyles. Fades, twists, locs, frohawks, hi-top fades, hi-top twists, caesars, nappy fros, blow outs, beards\u2026just look at this selfie of the players selected in the 2015 NBA draft. Or do a Google image search for Afropunk and look at all the styles there. All things considered, when it comes to versatility and acceptance, this is probably the best time for Black hair in America\u2026ever. And its all because of people born in the late 80s and early 90s. Not us. We can't take credit for that one.\n\nThey're generally more open-minded. And less afraid to be themselves.\n\nOf course, anyone thinking racism and bias and shit are going to die out in the next couple of decades needs to take their New Black goggles off and remove their heads from up Pharrell's ass. But you can't deny that growing up with an actual Black president instead of a TV one and the legalization of gay marriage and even us allowing an actual orangutan to run for president has to have some effect on what younger people are generally more accepting of. At least in comparison to previous generations. When you add this with how internet makes it easier to connect with like-minded people, there just does seem to be more room for and embrace of individuality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(They still couldn't beat us in a fight, tho.

It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["mother", "case", "seeking", "parents", "daughter", "congolese", "immigration", "refuge", "detention", "lawsuit", "apart", "border", "separate", "post", "report", "torn", "explain", "policy"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

She and her husband, Jamal, planned three parties over one weekend and had $43,000 in cash on hand that her husband was taking to the bank around 11 a.m. As Jamal stopped to talk to his friends, Baltimore City Sgt. Wayne Jenkins and his partner pulled up and searched his car.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey find a small bag of marijuana, but that\u2019s a lie. But they use it as an opportunity to arrest him,\u201d defense attorney Ivan Bates told The Root. \u201cThey submit $23,000 and keep $20,000 for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bates, this was a regular tactic used by Baltimore City police to get the addresses of people whom they considered high rollers because they had expensive cars.\n\n\n\nThey then went to Jovonne Walker\u2019s house and tried to break in. Jovonne was so frightened that she pushed the silent alarm button. According to Bates, a new set of officers showed up in response to the alarm, but Jenkins and his partner said that they would handle it. They searched the house without a warrant, saying that Jovonne agreed to let them search. They later went back and obtained a warrant. They found two guns that Jovonne owned, and charged her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the aftermath of their arrests, the couple almost lost their house. Jamal, who worked as an electrician, wasn\u2019t able to get some clearances to work. One of their cars was repossessed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have your life turned upside down for almost two years, to not be able to work in a field that you\u2019re passionate about because you have pending charges. Fearing for my kids\u2019 life because someone was trying to get into our home. It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner.

The terms of the decree have not yet been made public.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said Wednesday morning, \u201cWe\u2019re very, very close. We\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe decree follows a lengthy investigation by the Justice Department, partially in response to the 2015 arrest and death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent civil unrest in Baltimore.\n\nA 163-page findings report released by the DOJ in August said that the Baltimore Police Department has engaged in unconstitutional and discriminatory policing practices for years, many of which disproportionately affected residents in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods.\n\nAs the Sun reports, in lieu of an immediate lawsuit to resolve the problems, the Justice Department agreed to negotiate with the city and reach a consent decree that ensured the Police Department \u201cdelivers services in a manner that respects the rights of residents, increases trust between officers and the communities they serve, and promotes public and officer safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA consent decree is a type of settlement in a lawsuit or criminal case in which a person or company agrees to take specific actions without admitting fault or guilt for the situation that led to the lawsuit. In this instance, the BPD is not admitting any guilt or wrongdoing, but it is agreeing to make the recommended reforms to a range of its policies, tactics and operations.\n\nAccording to the Sun, these include how officers conduct street enforcement; respond to sexual assault complaints; and interact with youths, protesters and those with mental illnesses.\n\nAdditionally, the decree is expected to require the department to introduce new layers of oversight for officers; new methods of tracking officer misconduct and other data; new training; and investments in modern technologies that would add mobile computers in patrol cars, streamline operations, and enhance data retention and analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, it is expected to touch on community policing, community oversight and transparency.\n\nThe agreement comes a little more than a week before the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20, which is key, because as the Sun notes, current Justice Department officials and city leaders set that date as the deadline to get the deal done amid fears that Trump and his pick for U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, would be less exacting \u201coverseers\u201d of troubled police departments than current Attorney General Loretta Lynch and President Barack Obama.\n\nPugh called a Thursday-morning meeting of the city\u2019s spending panel to approve the decree, and members of the public will be allowed to comment on the agreement during that meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Baltimore Sun.", "keywords": ["city", "department", "justice", "decree", "agreement", "lawsuit", "trump", "reforms", "policing", "baltimore", "reach", "officers", "consent"], "polarity": 0.03353929924242424, "subjectivity": 0.402717803030303},

But just one. OK, both. Maybe I cried a little. Not a Mufasa-death cry, but like, you know what? It just had me in my feelings.\n\n\n\nThe picture of her holding August\u2019s face with August smiling that pure-innocence happiness smile? Maaaaan, it took me out. We all know that representation matters; as adults, we often wax poetic about the fact that seeing ideas and themes that are true to our experiences makes a difference in our self-determination and self-esteem. Hell, that\u2019s part of why African America\u2019s body and soul are ready to see Black Panther with outfits ironed and shoes spit shined. But the story and picture got me for another reason.\n\nI have a 9-year-old daughter who goes to a private school in Alexandria, Va. It\u2019s a fairly diverse school\u2014definitely more diverse than I expected any private school to be. I remember that when we did the original interview with the school, I made it a point to stress that my daughter was black and that it was important that the school was aware of this, too. Then, on the first day of school, half her class was black. I felt relieved that hers wasn\u2019t the only black face in her class. But that\u2019s the students. The teachers are another story.\n\n\n\nTo my knowledge, at the lower school, there are three black teachers, and two are physical education teachers. Needless to say, my worry was that my daughter wasn\u2019t likely to end up with a teacher who looks like her for her entire elementary school experience and perhaps beyond. Except ... she did. One of the first-grade teachers is a black woman who I believe went to an HBCU and is a Delta. And she ended up being my daughter\u2019s first-grade teacher. I had no idea she taught there until I walked into her classroom and saw her and almost had a heart attack.\n\nI was so happy at that moment. My daughter was going to have a person who looked like her\u2014she even said she loved her teacher because she reminded her of her mom\u2014guiding her. A teacher who understood some of what she\u2019d go through in life and, at the very least, whom my daughter could look to and say, \u201cShe looks like me.\u201d That meant a lot to me, and her teacher could tell once we had our first conversation.\n\nRepresentation matters. And Ms. Bishop leveled that up. She showed that little girl that who she is and what she looks like are things to be proud of and that other people may want to look like her. Talk about an esteem boost. MY esteem went up, like, two levels from seeing that picture and reading the story. People say things, but to actually show your student, especially a little black girl, that her hair is awesome? Stick a fork in me; I\u2019m done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women have to deal with society (and both black and nonblack communities) judging their hair, and I know that hair can be a constant source of stress. And yet here goes Ms. Bishop showing up and showing out and saying, \u201cHey August, you are beautiful\u2014look, my hair is like yours!\u201d\n\nWater. Works.\n\nI like feel-good stories. I especially like feel-good stories where little kids are made to feel better or are able to feel real joy because of something positive. When little black kids get esteem boosts about who they are, though, I beam with pride and I feel better about the world my children are walking into, even with all of its problems. So I appreciate what Ms. Bishop did. I know her story isn\u2019t the only one like that, but as a parent, I\u2019m glad to know this story exists and gets some spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Ms. Bishop, it might have been something small to show one of her students that she did indeed like her hair. But for a lot of us parents, decisions like that and investments in both the education and the esteem of our children mean the world. There is no icebox where my heart used to be right now.\n\nHere comes another one of those tears.", "keywords": ["ms", "teacher", "prek", "know", "black", "students", "hair", "little", "daughter", "hairstyle", "bishop", "dad", "school", "teachers", "feels", "leigh", "matching"], "polarity": 0.13693894729609013, "subjectivity": 0.5453416821273963},

The departments recommend that the memorandums require training for school officers and also explicitly state that their role should not involve meting out day-to-day discipline, as well as other specifications.\n\nAlthough the initiative is essentially guidance from the federal government, the Post notes, agencies will be required to follow it in order to qualify for federal grants that pay for the hiring of up to 150 school resource officers a year.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["wanted", "riots", "know", "black", "tchalla", "revisionist", "cant", "help", "history", "killmonger", "folks", "panther", "njobu"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

Polanco\u2019s Afro-Latina beauty plays loud and proud, as she\u2019s now partnered with legacy brand Dove on the company\u2019s self-esteem-education workshops.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, since founding the initiative in 2004, Dove has become the largest provider of self-esteem education in the world, reaching more young people than any nongovernmental organization, educational institution or government at 20 million and counting. The Glow Up had the pleasure of talking with boundary-breaking actress Polanco at Dove\u2019s latest workshop for teens.\n\nThe Glow Up: You\u2019ve always been outspoken about beauty inequality. Why did you partner with Dove?\n\nDascha Polanco: I\u2019m being very honest with you: I remember when Dove first came out with that billboard\u2014all the women wearing full briefs. I\u2019m a full-brief kind of girl, you know what I mean? When I saw Dove embrace real women and real bodies, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where brands need to be headed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I learned that they\u2019ve partnered with Shonda Rhimes on self-esteem-education workshops and that they\u2019ve helped over 20 million young girls to have a positive relationship with themselves and self-esteem and body confidence, it was something that I wanted to be part of.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the goal?\n\nDP: Allowing this new generation to enter positions of power with open minds. We are teaching them to be willing to look beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to think is right or what\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Can you share ways that you lift your own self-esteem?\n\nDP: It\u2019s very important to have gender equality in my household [so] that things are done across the board\u2014not because you\u2019re a boy, not because you\u2019re a girl\u2014but because you\u2019re both equally valuable. You both have the capacity, the ability, to go far farther than me, beyond me\u2014your opportunities are limitless. Whenever I feel like I have a positive impact, I can bring my daughter to the Dove self-esteem workshops and she can learn from these resources.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do people have to go in person to the workshop?\n\nDP: Dove has the resources on the website. They also have parenting courses about how self-esteem starts in the home. When you look at studies of bullying in school, depression and suicidal behaviors have gone up because of not paying attention to the real issues affecting the youth. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids.

What are a couple of goals within the next month to get you there?\u201d\n\nAnd I do that with my daughter. I\u2019m in [a] constant battle with my daughter Dasany, who doesn\u2019t leave the house without her eyebrows painted on. She has eyebrows, but they\u2019re light eyebrows and I\u2019m like, \u201cGirl!\u201d I try to emphasize that with her beautiful skin right now, she doesn\u2019t need anything. I do whatever I can to make a positive impact, like bringing my daughter to this workshop with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about words and what they hear; words penetrate your children so much. Sometimes, to compensate for the time that we don\u2019t get to spend with them, we\u2019re like, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping,\u201d or some other materialistic thing. [But] you\u2019ll be surprised how much spending an hour talking with your kids changes them.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nTGU: And the conversation we have with ourselves?\n\nDP: We are focused ourselves on what is negative without truly having taken the moment to acknowledge our own external differences\u2014wanting to be approved of, wanting to be accepted.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["mother", "case", "seeking", "parents", "daughter", "congolese", "immigration", "refuge", "detention", "lawsuit", "apart", "border", "separate", "post", "report", "torn", "explain", "policy"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

In fact, a new report by the Center for American Progress and the Movement Advancement Project demonstrates how intersecting forms of racism, transphobia and homophobia create uniquely unsafe conditions for LGBTQ people of color who interact with police and the broader criminal-justice system.\n\nLGBTQ people of color, particularly transgender women of color, experience a significant amount of violence. According to FBI data, LGBTQ people are the most likely group to experience a hate crime, and a recent report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs shows that 60 percent of hate violence against LGBTQ and HIV-affected people was against people of color.\n\nJust this summer, at least two black transgender women were murdered: Dee Whigham, a 25-year-old nurse who was murdered in her hotel room in Mississippi, and Deeniquia Dodds, a 22-year-old who was shot near her home in Washington, D.C. These murders are part of a larger, disturbing trend of transgender women being murdered across the country.\n\nHowever, despite documented high rates of violence, police are often indifferent or even hostile to LGBTQ people of color seeking help. According to the 2016 NCAVP report, 80 percent of LGBTQ and HIV-positive survivors of hate violence who reached out to police reported that police were either indifferent or hostile toward them. In addition, despite a clear need, LGBTQ people are reporting these experiences to police less and less often, likely because pervasive police violence and discrimination against LGBTQ people leads them to mistrust law enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only do police often fail to protect LGBTQ people of color from violence, but police also sometimes punish them for being victimized. Police officers are 30 times more likely (pdf) to arrest the survivor of domestic violence along with the perpetrator when the case involves a same-sex couple than when it involves a male perpetrator and female survivor. In some cases, LGBTQ hate crime victims have actually been arrested and charged with crimes for defending themselves. CeCe McDonald, a black transgender woman with a history of surviving physical and sexual assault, was the only person arrested after defending herself against a group of white men and women who were shouting racist and transphobic slurs as she walked by and then slashed her face with glass, unprovoked.\n\nDisturbingly, LGBTQ and HIV-positive people of color who are survivors of violence are 2.4 times more likely than their white counterparts to experience police violence, according to a 2015 NCAVP study (pdf). Transgender people of color who are survivors of violence are 6.2 times more likely than their white counterparts to experience police violence.\n\nLGBTQ communities of color also experience prejudicial profiling because of intersecting forms of racism, homophobia and transphobia. For example, Human Rights Watch found that transgender women in New Orleans are subject to constant harassment, verbal abuse and stops based on suspicion of prostitution. As an LGBTQ community member in New Orleans said, based on personal experience, \u201cThey are targeted because walking down the street while being young, black and transgender is considered a crime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe level and types of police mistreatment and violence that LGBTQ communities of color face warrant particular attention. That means both inserting LGBTQ experiences into national discussions about police violence and ensuring that police-reform initiatives are LGBTQ-inclusive\u2014including anti-profiling laws that prohibit profiling on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, police-oversight commissions with the power to hold police accountable, and task forces for hate crimes and other forms of violence that disproportionately affect LGBTQ people of color. It is incumbent upon all of us to highlight and work to address the ways in which LGBTQ communities of color are both uniquely vulnerable to violence and experience a dangerous lack of institutional protection from it.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nLaura E.

There were no punitive damages.\n\nAccording to the Sun, the Gaines family was tearful after the verdict was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other side, Baltimore County government attorney Mike Field said in a statement that the county was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision and \u201cis reviewing all of its options, including an appeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mother died, a child was unintentionally injured, and police officers were placed in mortal danger. By any account, this was a tragic situation,\u201d Fields said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaines\u2019 family alleged civil rights violations and filed the lawsuit against the county as well as Cpl. Royce Ruby, who fired the deadly shots on Aug. 1, 2016. The suit sought more than $42 million for Gaines\u2019 estate and her survivors.\n\nThe jury reached its verdict after nearly three weeks of testimony and legal arguments.\n\nGaines\u2019 case garnered national attention after videos she broadcast of the standoff went live on social media. Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S. Ruckle Jr. told the jury that when no one would answer the door, officers kicked it in, and the first officer to enter the apartment was \u201cconfronted with Korryn Gaines with a shotgun pointed right at him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Gaines\u2019 fiance left the apartment with their infant daughter, she remained behind with their 5-year-old son. Gaines, 23, remained inside her Randallstown apartment with tactical officers stationed in the hallway outside for six hours.\n\nRuby, who would ultimately kill Gaines and injure her young son, was posted just outside her apartment door\u2014which was cracked open.\n\nRuckle claimed that Ruby was in danger because although he was wearing tactical gear, his arms, legs and face were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ruckle, Ruby decided to fire into the apartment when he saw Gaines and her son go into the kitchen. The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun? What parent puts their kid in that kind of unsafe position?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also blamed Gaines for her own death.\n\n\u201cKorryn Gaines started it. She\u2019s the one who determined how it was going to end,\u201d Ruckles said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the jury sided with Gaines and her family.\n\nThe settlement will not bring Gaines back. Her life is lost forever. But this jury\u2019s decision does feel like some sort of vindication. No officers were charged in her death.\n\nThis settlement may help to bring some amount of closure to her family\u2019s grieving and suffering, and it will help provide for the two children she left behind.", "keywords": ["awarded", "gaines", "korryn", "county", "shot", "son", "jury", "family", "37000000", "officer", "apartment", "million", "damages", "officers", "vindication", "awards"], "polarity": 0.016848151848151846, "subjectivity": 0.41497557997558004},

According to the station, the 46-year-old was also acquitted on all of the other charges he faced: three counts of manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of vehicular manslaughter, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.\n\nClosing arguments in Goodson's trial, which lasted eight days, were presented Monday.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights.

But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F.

In addition, the LDF claims that DHS former Acting Secretary Elaine C. Duke and current DHS Secretary Kirstjen \u201cAre Norwegians White?\u201d Nielsen took \u201cirrational and discriminatory government action\u201d in revoking the protections.\n\nThanks in part to racist comments President Donald Trump made during a recent meeting with lawmakers on immigration, the LDF also says that it can show that the Trump administration clearly intended to discriminate against Haitians based on their race and ethnicity.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the LDF, says that the case is \u201csimple\u201d:\n\nOur democracy rests on the bedrock principle that every person is equal before the law. Governmental decisions that target people based on racial discrimination violate our Constitution. The decision by the Department of Homeland Security to rescind TPS status for Haitian immigrants was infected by racial discrimination. Every step taken by the Department to reach this decision reveals that far from a rational and fact-based determination, this decision was driven by calculated, determined and intentional discrimination against Haitian immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence of an intent to discriminate, the suit points to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s active seeking of crime data on Haitians with TPS and information on how many Haitians were receiving public benefits\u2014data the LDF says \u201ctrades on false anti-Black stereotypes about criminality and exploitation of public benefits.\u201d The hunt for this data also \u201csuggests the effort to manufacture a public safety rationale\u201d for the removal of the protections.\n\nBut the strongest evidence of an intent to discriminate comes straight from the shithole mouth of 45 himself.\n\nThe suit refers to Trump\u2019s recent remarks disparaging immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African nations\u2014comments he made in front of lawmakers during an official meeting to determine immigration policy.

Once you\u2019ve seen those pixelated smartphone or half-working body-camera videos spreading like brushfire on social media, it\u2019s safe to expect next an announcement from the U.S. attorney general. Like the iconic bat signal for Batman, post-shooting outrage typically boils down to collective cries for a federal follow-up. Is your city suffering from chronic lapses in police judgment? Call now for a free sample of DOJ to get you back on your feet.\n\nBut are Department of Justice investigations into the murky underbelly of law-enforcement misconduct really (ever) all that effective? That greatly depends on whether you pick paper, rock or scissors\u2014or if you define effectiveness merely as the number of pages in lengthy, avuncularly worded reports. Two weeks after the Baltimore Police Department got served with its own damning federal write-up, there were few signs that Charm City\u2019s head-cracking finest were hastily moving toward reform despite lots of talk about it. A charred West Baltimore and four acquitted police officers later, Wire-town is still full of nervous residents, rising violent crime and jumpy po-po. Some quietly suggest that last year\u2019s \u201cuprising\u201d is bound for an even nastier repeat.\n\nOptimistic counternarratives will argue that these things take time. But as black body counts pile up with no end in sight, an exasperated mood says that something\u2019s got to give other than official-sounding pomp, fresh rounds of barely implemented \u201cconsent decrees,\u201d and embarrassing probes that only end up leading to hush-money-level victim settlements burning holes in city budgets while doing little to repair permanently damaged lives. No, sorry: Those big Justice Department reports won\u2019t change your bad-cop-afflicted city, and they sure won\u2019t tell you anything you didn\u2019t already know. Behold five reasons why:\n\n1. Reports Are Toothless\n\nDOJ reports spot problems. And they sure get heavy on the callouts and recommendations. But what good is that if they\u2019re not enforcing the civil rights laws broken? It's bad enough that they take too long in the first place to investigate when trouble strikes. When those cases are wrapped up, the DOJ will force compliance through mediated \u201cconsent decrees,\u201d the likes of which have grown more frequent in the past decade, designed to force trigger-happy police departments to radically alter the way they use force and connect with communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet as PBS\u2019 Frontline found, the reforms miss deadlines by years, the taxpayer cost is insane, and \u201cuse of force by officers increased during and after the agreements. In five others, it stayed the same or declined.\u201d\n\n2. Many Cops Just Don\u2019t Care About Communities They Don\u2019t Live In\n\nIt is, arguably, the biggest problem with American policing in urban areas today: Sixty percent of big-city cops don\u2019t live where they patrol. In Baltimore alone, nearly 80 percent of city police officers don\u2019t live in the city (and yes, that includes the black cops who constitute 42 percent of Baltimore\u2019s finest)\u2014and yet the Justice Department report barely mentioned it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLack of residency requirements for urban cops is a law-enforcement formula set up to fail. How can you expect fully armed public servants to show any empathy toward people they don\u2019t really know or understand on any sort of level outside of policing? Since they don\u2019t live there, they\u2019re not invested. The Ferguson, Mo., officer who killed Michael Brown commuted every day from 95-percent-white Crestwood, Mo.; the Cleveland cop who killed Tamir Rice lived in the totally white suburb of Independence, Ohio.\n\nMost white officers involved in tragic big-city shootings of black residents live in cozy, very white, very suburban and mostly Republican congressional districts. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in June destroyed Milwaukee\u2019s residency requirements for city workers, including police\u2014and now the city wonders why tensions flared into rioting flames following its own police shooting. In essence, nationwide housing segregation (a major problem that the Obama administration tried to address amid congressional GOP grumbling) sets up a scenario whereby anxious police officers commute each day into what they perceive as dangerous concrete jungles full of restless natives.\n\n3. There\u2019s No National Policing Standard\n\nWhat the Justice Department investigations and subsequent reports won\u2019t highlight (when they should) is that American policing is a jacked-up medley of state and local law-enforcement rules. You travel from one state to the next and you just won\u2019t know what sort of police swamp you\u2019re stepping into. Problem is, there is no one set of national rules on policing, or a strictly observed national \u201c101\u201d on what\u2019s acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongress could be going about the business of crafting a police standard (instead of nosily sifting through presidential-candidate emails like gossipy kids in the cafeteria). The Police Executive Research Forum, or PERF, made a big step in that direction when it released its \u201c30 Guiding Principles on Use of Force\u201d (pdf) report in March. (You should read it\u2014and then ask your local police department if they got a copy.) But guess who shot down PERF\u2019s main suggestion that agencies retrain officers to avoid conflict and respect the \u201csanctity of life\u201d of everyone at all times? You guessed it: police unions.\n\n4. Those Pesky Police Unions\n\nThere's not much else the Justice Department can do when powerful police unions refuse to work collaboratively on recommendations or respond constructively to intelligent performance critiques. The go-to lobby for most state, local and federal elected officials on \u201cpolice reform\u201d issues is their local police union\u2014forced in large part by the ability of police unions to rally their members into crucial voting blocs on Election Day. With the re-emergence of a politically electrified \u201claw and order\u201d environment brought on by presidential dog whistling, don\u2019t expect that to end anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. No Investment in Urban Schools, Poverty Reduction, the Environment or Infrastructure\n\nJustice Department probes could be a lot more insightful and helpful if they decided to get a bit more holistic on cause and effect. Still, few with the power, influence or noise to reduce police misconduct are willing to spotlight the direct link between urban decay and the frequency with which cops are killing or brutalizing underserved residents. A messier, less discussed narrative is how the blighted conditions of those killed created a path to those moments. So you can\u2019t truly reform criminal justice until you eliminate poverty.\n\nUpticks in crime, crumbling schools, persistent unemployment and environments creating chronic public health hazards can only aggravate the situation. A 2015 Century Foundation report suggests that the growing concentration of American poverty (particularly in the wake of recession and government budget cuts) is a significant factor contributing to police-community tensions. \"Our governance and development practices ensure that significant segments of our population live in neighborhoods where there is no work, where there are underperforming schools, and where there is little access to opportunity,\" wrote Century fellow Paul Jargowsky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittle surprise, then, when places like Ferguson, Baltimore and Milwaukee pop off. Without adequate and pre-emptive investment in those areas needing it most, the Justice Department will just keep wasting ink and headlines.\n\nCharles D.

His body lay in the street in blood for over four hours, awakening the St. Louis community and sparking a passionate, unflinching movement, including weeks of unrest.\n\nA lot has changed in the region over the last 24 months, and a new type of fight for black lives is emerging.\n\n\u201cI feel that it\u2019s [activism in St. Louis] powerful,\u201d Brown\u2019s father, Michael Brown Sr., told The Root. \u201cI want everyone\u2019s voice to be heard all of the time. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s good or bad; it\u2019s just how that individual feels. You can\u2019t knock anyone for how they feel. As long as the movement is in a positive state, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, Brown Sr. established the Michael Brown Foundation, doing business as Chosen for Change, to offer support to other families who have lost loved ones as a result of community violence or police brutality. This past weekend, Friday, Aug. 5, to Sunday, Aug. 7, the CFC hosted its second annual Memorial Weekend in Ferguson, featuring \u201cYouth Speak Truth,\u201d where young people expressed themselves through art, spoken word and performance, and siblings and family members of those lost to racial violence shared their stories. There was also a walk for justice, a community day, scholarship and benefit dinner, and a prayer breakfast. The culminating event will be a prayer vigil and national moment of silence on Aug. 9.\n\n\u201cFor almost two years, working hand in hand, the foundation and the people in the community have been utilizing their own resources to restore, strengthen and comfort grieving families,\u201d said Brown Sr., president of the foundation.\n\nSince Brown Jr.\u2019s death, community organizing and activism have evolved, from marching and protesting on the front lines to working toward transforming the political and social climates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople have found where they fit in,\u201d spoken-word artist Carlos Ball told The Root. Ball became an activist in 2013 when his brother, Cary Ball Jr., was shot and killed by a St. Louis police officer. \u201cSome have found their [place] in politics, and others in mentoring. I feel like it\u2019s changed for the better. This generation is birthing a lot of positive people.\u201d\n\nSeveral Ferguson activists and organizers decided to pursue change by seeking elected office. In the August primary election, Cori Bush, ordained pastor and co-director of the Truth Telling Project; Bruce Franks Jr.; Rasheen Aldridge with Show Me $15; and Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal were on the ballot. Bush ran a campaign for the U.S. Senate; Franks for state representative of Missouri's 78th District; Aldridge for 5th Ward committeeman; and Chappelle-Nadal for U.S. Congress. They didn\u2019t win, but Franks and Aldridge came very close, losing their races by 84 and 52 votes (pdf), respectively. Franks has decided to challenge the count.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked at who was running, I realized that nobody was running on the federal level who carried on our issues. I felt like the next place it could evolve was moving into those places of power,\" Bush told The Root. \"We did a lot of work, but there was no one to push through what we needed to get pushed through. [So I thought,] why not move into those positions where things can actually happen, where laws are written? This time it might have only been four of us, but the next time it could be eight, and if the next time it doubled again, then that's how we change the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis defines the current phase of what many call the modern civil rights movement\u2014fulfilling demands of the movement through political intervention.\n\n\u201cWe have some power here; we just need to do more grassroots organizing. It is not about Bernie. It is not about Trump. It is not about Hillary,\u201d Alisha Sonnier told The Root. The activist, president of Tribe X and St. Louis University student added: \u201cIt\u2019s about the people in St. Louis who are born into zip codes where the expectation is that they won\u2019t live beyond 30, or that they don\u2019t have a real shot at graduating. It\u2019s about Lisa, who doesn\u2019t have grocery stores in her community and is living in a food desert.\u201d\n\nYoung people are an integral part of organizing in the area, stepping up to help people in need. Over the summer, 17-year-old Mya Petty, who became involved in activism after Brown Jr.\u2019s death, started a lunch program with Rodney McGruder Brown called STL Lunch. Petty set up a picnic-style lunch in Hickey Park of the Baden neighborhood, providing sandwiches, water, juice and fresh fruit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead of just sitting in a house every day during the summer, she was going out to the park, interacting with the children, providing them with activities and introducing them to new foods,\u201d said Sonnier. \u201cIt\u2019s just about loving and supporting each other, and empowering one another. Whenever you do something along those lines, you're doing something for the movement.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal is community development from the inside out and providing people with the opportunities and resources they need to thrive.\n\n\u201cBlack resistance is happening in St. Louis, and there is pretty much no area you can name where no one is doing work,\u201d Sonnier added. \u201cWhether that\u2019s the schools, the homeless community, LGBTQ, whatever you can think of, there is somebody doing work in that area and probably doing work in multiple areas.\u201d", "keywords": ["community", "work", "powerful", "brown", "doing", "st", "louis", "franks", "movement", "told", "root", "aug", "state", "postferguson"], "polarity": 0.10933884297520662, "subjectivity": 0.3815151515151515},

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["mother", "case", "seeking", "parents", "daughter", "congolese", "immigration", "refuge", "detention", "lawsuit", "apart", "border", "separate", "post", "report", "torn", "explain", "policy"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

It was a familiar scenario. I cry on all of my two sons\u2019 birthdays. They are 7 and 4. Mine are not tears of joy but, rather, tears of fear. Fear for them growing up. Fear of them no longer being viewed as the adorable, innocent, silly children I know them to be, particularly by those in positions of authority.\n\nStudies show that black boys lose the perception of innocence in broader society around age 10. After that, people view them as overly aggressive and even dangerous. While other children have the privilege to be carefree, our children, particularly our boys, have the additional burden of not appearing too threatening\u2014all of this long before they can even drive. That\u2019s exactly what happened to 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was gunned down within two seconds by a Cleveland police officer for having a toy gun on the playground. For this reason, I will not allow my boys to play with guns of any kind, even brightly colored water guns. And on their birthdays\u2014before celebrating\u2014I cry. Why?\n\nBecause I, and I suspect many other moms all across America, suffer from a self-diagnosis that I call MOBB disorder. If you are a MOBB (mom of a black boy), the level of fear and anxiety that you feel regarding your children\u2019s basic safety, in the most mundane of situations, can be overwhelming. Selling CDs? You may be gunned down. Riding a commuter train? Shot in the back. Selling cigarettes? Choked to death. Celebrating your upcoming wedding? Shot at 50 times.\n\nAnd all at the hands of those who have sworn to protect and serve. That protection is not always extended to our sons. Often, they are immediately viewed as wild, irrational animals whose natural inclination is to harm and kill others. By what logic does a police officer pull over a car containing a man, his girlfriend and her 4-year-old child, and then, after the man, the driver, discloses that he\u2019s carrying a legal weapon, the officer assumes that the man expected to encounter and shoot a police officer that day?\n\nThe morning I learned that Philando Castile, a beloved Montessori school employee, was killed while his girlfriend and her child were seated in the car, something shifted inside me. I had gone to bed seeing the graphic video of Alton Sterling being murdered by a police officer in Baton Rouge, La., and woke up to Castile\u2019s murder in Minnesota.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, I could not get out of bed. I felt paralyzed. Heartbroken. Helpless and hopeless. How many times do we have to endure seeing images of someone\u2019s son being killed by police? These images, which followed a barrage of hashtags and uprisings, weighed me down. I could not bear it another day. And I certainly could not bear it alone.\n\nEventually I dragged myself out of bed and went downstairs to cook breakfast for my sons. As I was scrambling eggs and sizzling turkey sausage, I decided to activate an idea I\u2019d had for quite some time. With food still cooking on the stove, I walked over to my laptop and quickly created a Facebook group page called MOBB\u2014Mothers of Black Boys. I invited the first 30 friends who came to mind and started my first post by saying, \u201cI am starting this group today because I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d I simply wanted the comfort and connection of other moms who would understand my particular plight. And, boy, did I get it!\n\nWithin five minutes, 30 moms turned into 150. Within one hour, it was 500. Then 1,000; 2,000; 4,000; 7,000; 11,000; 15,000. By the time I went to bed that night, more than 21,000 moms from all over the country had joined the group. They spontaneously started sharing images of their beautiful black boys, noting their many wonderful accomplishments, while also expressing genuine fear for their precious lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shared articles, videos, resource lists and even prayed together, all online. It was one of the most beautiful displays of sisterhood that I had ever experienced at this mass level. But then people started reaching out to me to ask how they could get involved, start a MOBB chapter in their state, buy the T-shirt, plan our conference and more. What had I done?\n\nSince then, we have grown to more than 70,000 moms of black boys and are now in full strategy mode on how to best organize to solve this problem. We learned that an organization in Columbia, S.C., that is doing great work on closing the educational-achievement gap and improving life overall for black boys is already using the name Mothers of Black Boys. So we are moving forward as Moms of Black Boys United.\n\nI know that I am in partnership with the people who are most motivated to solve this problem because we live with the fear every day. We plan to use a multifaceted approach to address the issues and contributing factors at the local, state and federal levels, with the ultimate goal of influencing policy that prevents police from harassing, brutalizing and killing our boys and men without accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also mourn the recent loss of multiple police officers to unnecessary violence. Violence is never the answer, and the slain officers are someone's sons, too. Therefore, we want to work toward rooting out police officers who abuse their position of authority. They give fine men and women in law enforcement who do their jobs well and risk their lives every day to protect us a bad name.\n\nWatching black men killed by police on TV (and practically live on Facebook!) has become America\u2019s favorite new reality show. We watch. Some of us are outraged. Others demonize the victim. We create hashtags, change our profile pictures. Then it all goes away, until it happens again.\n\nBut for mothers of black boys, that pain and fear never goes away. With each new case, our anxiety increases, our MOBB-disorder symptoms intensify and our boys\u2019 futures look a little less bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday we join together to say that using the murder of black men and boys to feed the 24-hour news cycle must stop. Unjustified killing of black men and boys by police officers without accountability must stop. Our sons will not be your reality show. They will not be a hashtag.\n\nAs I celebrate my son\u2019s birthday next month, I will move past the tears by uniting with Moms of Black Boys all across the country to work together to ensure our sons\u2019 survival. Because we love them more than anyone else, and we have no other choice.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepelsha McGruder is a happily married mom of two boys and entertainment executive living in Brooklyn, N.Y.

He hinted that this shortened extension will be the last, saying that TPS recipients should take \u201ctime to attain travel documents and make other necessary arrangements for their ultimate departure from the United States.\u201d\n\n\n\nCaucasian Scandal has had a harrowing run over the past couple of weeks, with President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey showing strong evidence of obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense. The string of revelations has optimists believing that the Trump administration\u2014a redoubt for white supremacy plus Ben Carson\u2014may finally implode. But for Haiti, the White House will not be exhumed soon enough.\n\nTuesday is the deadline for the Department of Homeland Security to renew Haiti\u2019s Temporary Protected Status before it expires July 22. The designation allows immigrants of countries suffering from armed conflict, environmental disaster or \u201cother extraordinary and temporary conditions\u201d to legally work in the United States. Haiti, ravaged by decades of violent political upheavals and poverty, was granted TPS status right after 2010\u2019s catastrophic earthquake. The black nation has had one of the longest TPS stays in the designation\u2019s history, but after a cholera epidemic and 2016\u2019s deadly Hurricane Matthew again devastated Haiti, experts are calling for an 18-month extension because the country doesn\u2019t have the resources to handle the potential deportees.\n\nThe unapologetically xenophobic Trump administration has barely shown any capacity for compassion, and it doesn\u2019t look as if DHS will lead a sea change. Early signs have been bleak: The Associated Press reported that a top immigration official requested crime data for the TPS-protected Haitians and data on whether they\u2019re receiving public benefits for which they\u2019re not eligible. Crime hasn\u2019t been a focal point in the past when it comes to renewing TPS, and to use such stats as a basis to make more than 50,000 immigrants vulnerable falls in line with the draconian policymaking that\u2019s been specific to Trump\u2019s office.\n\nThat the unfounded paranoia targets Haitians, however, is part of a long-standing tradition in U.S.-Haiti affairs. Since Haiti declared its independence in 1804, the U.S. has had a history of seeing the black republic as something to mold and subjugate for its patriotic, white interests. It\u2019s the racist disrespect that\u2019s in no small part responsible for Haiti\u2019s continuous disarray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Haiti won its independence from France\u2019s enslavement, the European country got to work debasing the first free black nation. Citing the loss of property\u2014essentially Haitians winning the right to their bodies\u2014France coerced the nation into paying an equivalent of $40 billion. The U.S., itself a nation of proud slaveowners, was happy to comply with France\u2019s cruelty, refusing to recognize Haiti until 1862 before granting bank loans in order to pay France. By the time Haiti\u2019s debt was settled in 1947, it had become an atrophied land.\n\nEurocentric extortion was also compounded by America\u2019s insistence on occupying Haiti. The most infamous of those transgressions was the 19-year occupation originally ordered by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915 under the pretense that the U.S. was defending against German influence and restabilizing the country following Haitian President Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam\u2019s assassination.\n\nThere were also excuses for America to exert its will. Although Haiti benefited from improved infrastructure and a steadier economy (though 40 percent of revenue was used to pay off U.S. and French creditors), the story of the United States\u2019 occupation is also a story of oppression that includes forced labor, sexual assault and protests ending in fatalities. Treating Haitians like humans was inessential because, according to Wilson\u2019s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, they weren\u2019t:\n\nThe experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is in them an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat self-interest-first, humanitarianism-second logic justified the U.S. role in the rise of Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier, whose murderous regime (1957 until his death in 1971) led Haiti\u2019s professionals and civilians to emigrate en masse. Marines trained and equipped the Tonton Macoute militia Papa Doc used to spread fear\u2014he was all right by the U.S. because he was anti-communist. And, surprise, objectively horrific acts can be excused through racism.\n\nIn a secondhand psychiatric evaluation of \u201cPapa Doc,\u201d the U.S. State Department Office of Medical Services noted that although his \u201cparanoid personality ... approached psychotic proportions at times,\u201d Haitians in general were a \u201cparanoid\u201d group unlike a \u201crational North American.\u201d In other words, chaos is in Haiti\u2019s nature, unlike its benevolent catalysts to the north.\n\nThe United States\u2019 pernicious influence includes its knack for usurping Haiti\u2019s democracy on multiple occasions, as well as the flood of imported rice in the \u201990s that put many of the island\u2019s farmers out of business. Even U.S. efforts to help Haiti following the earthquake have been laced with numerous issues, including the misappropriation of funds and the Clinton Foundation-built trailers that are also health hazards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very likely possibility that DHS is going to let TPS expire isn\u2019t, at least on a surface level, as vicious as some of the United States\u2019 other major 20th-century interferences. However, the ideology does continue a very cynical interpretation of American exceptionalism, where righteousness lies only in its own reflection.

Brian Rice relating to the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015, the prosecution argued that Rice showed a reckless disregard for Gray's life by throwing him into the transport wagon facedown, shackled and handcuffed onto a dirty, corrugated floor, and that as a commanding officer, Rice held greater culpability than other officers for failing to secure Gray in a seat belt.\n\nRice, 42, is charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.\n\nThe prosecution, led by Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow and Deputy State's Attorney of Criminal Intelligence Janice Bledsoe, argued that at stop 2, there was a sparse crowd of about three people, along with Gray's friend Brandon Ross. Defense lawyer Michael Belsky argued that according to police witnesses who were compelled to testify (Edward Nero, who was acquitted in his trial, and William Porter, who faces his retrial in the fall), the crowd was threatening and Rice had only a few seconds to make a decision about putting Gray in a seat belt and getting the van out of what they described as a chaotic space.\n\nWith video evidence, which included cellphone and CCTV footage, the prosecution showed that the crowd was sparser than the defense argued. Bledsoe said that there were five police officers on the scene who could have aided Rice if he was having trouble attaching Gray's seat belt.\n\nRice did not testify throughout the trial; nor was his initial statement to police after the incident used in the trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prosecution painted Rice as an officer who was escalating tensions with onlookers, rather than de-escalating, during Gray's arrest by threatening them with arrests and jail time. Ross, Bledsoe reminded the judge, referred to Rice as a \"jerk\" during his testimony.\n\n\"Rice has been on the force for 18 years and was promoted to a commander and lieutenant,\" Bledsoe said. Referring to Rice\u2019s having to make a split-second decision, he added, \"He had 18 years to make this decision.\"\n\nBelsky argued that the state failed to present any evidence to suggest that Rice knew of the risks associated with placing Gray on the floor of the van without securing him in a seat belt. The burden is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rice knew the risks and acted with corrupt intent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prosecution wasn't allowed to argue that civil suits relating to \"rough rides\" have cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in settlements for passengers who were not in seat belts. Last October, according to Baltimore Sun reports, the city paid $95,000 to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Christine Abbott, a Johns Hopkins University librarian, who alleged that she was subjected to a rough ride in 2012. Abbott said that police did not buckle her in before \"maniacally\" driving around after her arrest at a party on charges that were later dropped. At least three citizens have been paralyzed from rides in police transport vans. One ended up a quadriplegic.\n\n\"The prosecution could have used testimony if there was a witness that came forward from the city who said, \u2018We have informed the [Baltimore Police] Department that there are huge settlements that are taking place as a result of the failure to care and protect prisoners,\u2019\u201d said University of Maryland law professor Doug Colbert. \u201c\u2018And we are telling you that you have to do things differently.\u2019 \u2026 That in effect is really what the police general order was all about. That these lawsuits were costing taxpayers money.\"\n\nAlthough prosecutors have lost two cases with the same arguments, Colbert remains optimistic about their case. \"They have a strong case. They're determined to convict an officer, and that's not something that we see often,\" said Colbert, who has been following the trials on a daily basis. \"It's historic; it\u2019s precedent-setting.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren Alperstein, a Baltimore defense attorney who has been following the case closely, is less optimistic about the chances of a conviction. \"The case comes down to foreseeability in the failure to seat-belt. There's no general order that requires a lieutenant to perform any different than anyone else. There's no evidence whatsoever that Lt. Rice intended for Freddie Gray to be injured or had any ill will towards Gray.

Remember how the first one came out and we were all like, \u201cShut up, Homeland Security\u201d? Well, apparently the administration has realized what a horrible idea this was and has shut down the report\u2014for now, anyway.\n\nAn announcement on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement website says:\n\nICE remains committed to publishing the most accurate information available regarding declined detainers across the country and continues to analyze and refine its reporting methodologies. While this analysis is ongoing, the publication of the Declined Detainer Outcome Report (DDOR) will be temporarily suspended.\n\nAn announcement on the corrections page of the site seems to offer further explanation:\n\nDue to a data processing error, the Jan. 28 - Feb 03, 2017 Declined Detainer Outcome Report incorrectly attributed issued detainers to Franklin County, Iowa; Franklin County, New York; Franklin County, Pennsylvania; and Montgomery County, Iowa that were in fact issued to agencies outside of the respective county\u2019s jurisdiction in similarly named locations. Additionally, detainers that appeared as being declined by Williamson County, TX and Bastrop County, TX were cases where the individual was transferred to another facility where they were released. Finally, detainers appeared as being declined by Chester County, PA and Richmond County, NC when those detainers were incorrectly issued to those locations. The subjects of those detainers were in different locations\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, the Trump administration promised to publicly shame any city or county that did not cooperate with federal immigration authorities by detaining undocumented immigrants who have been arrested or charged with a crime. The Department of Homeland Security made good on that promise March 20 by publishing its first weekly list of local jails and jurisdictions that had not honored the so-called immigrant-detainer requests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA detainer requests that local law-enforcement agencies notify ICE within 48 hours before a \u201cremovable alien\u201d is released from custody and asks that the law-enforcement agency, or LEA, hold the person for up to 48 additional hours in order to allow ICE to assume custody of the individual for \u201cremovable purposes.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, the practice was suspended after only three reports were published because, DHS says, it is conducting a review to ensure greater accuracy in its reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany cities and jurisdictions mentioned in the first reports complained immediately and said that they had been included on the reports in error. CNN reports that although DHS issued corrections, spokesman David Lapan characterized them as \u201cdata processing\u201d errors. Some jurisdictions said that they felt bound by court rulings to decline the detainer requests without a warrant.\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nImmigration advocates also criticized the list for singling out the criminals among undocumented immigrants without acknowledging the contributions of the broader population to their communities. When asked about the pushback, Lapan did not say that the move was a result of the response from cities and advocates, but did say a \u201cdialogue\u201d had been opened, as was partially the hope of the report. \u201cThere is no time frame associated with that (suspension) because it\u2019s based on a desire to make sure that we have quality data that the information that we\u2019re publishing is as accurate as we can be,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cAnd so (it will take) as long as it takes to get to that level of comfort that the secretary believes what we have is as good as it can be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Los Angeles Times offers another take:\n\n\u201cThere have been some data processing errors, and some other issues,\u201d Lapan told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe want to make sure we look at this holistically and make sure we are getting this as accurate as possible.\u201d The department still intends to \u201clet the public know which jurisdictions have policies that do not assist ICE in its mission,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know when the reports would resume. Under the Obama administration, a program called Secure Communities enlisted local police as partners in immigration enforcement. But there was a backlash after immigrants were detained and deported after minor violations like traffic tickets. And some court rulings have questioned the legality of police or jails continuing to hold someone without due process. One immigration rights advocate said the pullback points out the flaws in the new get-tough policy. \u201cOne of the fundamental problems with what the attorney general and President Trump are trying to do is to mobilize a massive deportation task force\u201d by shaming and pressuring states and cities, said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. \u201cThe fact that the federal government has had to pull back and apologize is a perfect example of how the federal government is overreaching here.\u201d Another point of contention: Just what does it mean to be a \u201csanctuary city?\u201d Some cities that won\u2019t honor detainers or detainers still work with ICE, by letting the agency know when someone is about to be released. One of them is Franklin County in south central Pennsylvania, which landed on the \u201cuncooperative\u201d list after ICE said the county jail was not honoring requests to hold five prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm, sounds like DHS didn\u2019t really have it all together when it decided to go crazy and publish this report in the first place, which is a trait that has become all too typical of the current administration: Act hastily now, then try to spin and fix it later.\n\nNo one is arguing that a criminal who poses a real threat to the safety of U.S. citizens should not be detained\u2014indeed, keep those people in jail and let them go through the court system if they are indeed guilty of those crimes\u2014but do not use our criminal-justice system as a backup plan for ICE.\n\nThat seems unreasonable and a way to target people who otherwise would be able to continue to be contributing members of American society as they attempt to navigate the confusing labyrinth that is our immigration system.", "keywords": ["wont", "detainers", "reports", "shame", "immigrants", "temporarily", "list", "county", "detain", "cities", "administration", "ice", "weekly", "immigration", "detainer", "declined", "suspends", "meant", "report"], "polarity": 0.07233340871400576, "subjectivity": 0.4356041760892506},

Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls, and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson Jr., but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to KVVU-TV, on Feb. 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges asleep on a pew.

Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie; he can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say). Hodges began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referenced Stephen Paddock, and, according to the police report, added that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and \u201csalutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cellphone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. \u201cPolice charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited,\u201d KVVU-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed.

Kelly and released Tuesday.\n\nNPR reports that the new rules align with the executive orders President Donald Trump issued in late January, calling for increased border security and stricter enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, \u201cThose people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety, or have committed a crime, will be the first to go. And we will be aggressively making sure that occurs. That is what the priority is.\u201d\n\nThe new rules would call for the Department of Homeland Security to greatly expand the number of immigrants who are prioritized for removal to include any person who is in the country illegally who may have committed a crime but not been charged, who has \u201cabused any program related to receipt of public benefits,\u201d or whom an immigration officer deems a risk to public safety or national security.\n\nBecause the rules are written so broadly, immigrant-rights advocates say that they make anyone in the country illegally a target for deportation, and that could affect as many as 8 to 11 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my many years of practicing immigration law, I have not seen a mass-deportation blueprint like this one,\u201d Maria Elena Hincapie, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said.\n\n\u201cThis means an undocumented mother ... who has been living in the United States for over 10 years and has a U.S. citizen child she\u2019s nursing would now also be considered a priority,\u201d Hincapie said.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s memos offer a guide from Trump to enact his mass deportation agenda which he talked about during the campaign trail,\u201d Hincapie added. \u201cBut [the memos] actually are even more extreme than his rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom NPR:\n\nWhile the new policies call for a \u201csurge\u201d in the deployment of immigration judges and other personnel, DHS officials said the agency is not planning mass deportations and that many of the new policies would take time to implement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a sense of panic necessarily in these communities,\u201d one DHS official said in a conference call with reporters. Homeland Security officials said the policies would not affect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama administration program that offered protection from deportation for so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The DHS wants to expand the use of so-called expedited removal, in which migrants do not appear before an immigration judge before being deported. Under the Obama administration, those expedited deportations had been limited to those in the country for two weeks or less, and within 100 miles of the border. DHS officials say they could seek to expand the use of expedited removal all over the country, for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for up to two years. Those rules have not yet been finalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNPR reports that the policies call for an expansion of the federal program that enlists the help of state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, but that partnership has come under fire by critics who allege that it has led to racial profiling. This proved true in Maricopa County, Ariz., where, in 2011, the federal government ended its agreement with then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the Justice Department found that officers in that county unlawfully stopped and detained Latinos.\n\nMeanwhile, DHS said Tuesday that the program is a \u201chighly successful force multiplier,\u201d that local officers go through extensive training and that racial profiling would not be tolerated.\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["policies", "program", "public", "immigrants", "empowering", "dhs", "detain", "country", "immigration", "rules", "memos", "secretary", "aggressively", "deport", "removal", "signs", "authorities", "security", "officials"], "polarity": 0.11332165641376167, "subjectivity": 0.39935017467912204},

But it does.\n\nMoving on ... so you live in Pittsburgh, right?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you attended a mixed-race high school and a predominantly white college?\n\nCorrect.\n\nHow does one live that life and never have any white friends?\n\nOh, I\u2019ve definitely had white friends. I had a white kid at the birthday slumber party I had when I was 10, and (at least) two of my white teammates in college were friends. Just right now, in 2018, I don\u2019t happen to have any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Damon Young\n\nSo you\u2019re not cool with any white people at all?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that either. There\u2019s a group of guys I\u2019ve been playing basketball with once a week for a decade. Most of them are white, and I\u2019m quite friendly with many of them. Some I\u2019d even call homies. As in, \u201cJohn\u2019s the white homie. He cool.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also the dozens of white people I see on a regular basis in coffee shops and at the Ace Hotel (where I do much of my work) and in my neighborhood. These are people I speak to regularly. Some I like more than others, but that\u2019s true for everyone, I guess.\n\nThese sound like friends.\n\nMaybe they do to you. But there\u2019s a difference between a friend and someone you happen to like and happen to be very friendly with. For instance, there are maybe 20 people I interact with on a regular basis through text, email, Google Hangouts, Slack and Facebook. With many of these people, I have the types of private conversations and share the types of inside jokes that would either be too irrelevant or too inappropriate to share publicly. The insularity of these interactions is trusting, connecting and intentional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are some of the people I consider friends, and none of them are white. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve intentionally barred white people from friendship\u2014just that, considering my friendship criteria, none right now would qualify.\n\nAnd just so you don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me\u2014that there are white people out there who consider me a friend but it\u2019s just not reciprocated\u2014I\u2019ve been invited to maybe 20 weddings in the last five years. Do you want to guess how many of those invitations were from white people?\n\nZero?\n\nActually, two. But these were from white people who happen to be friends with my wife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I will say that there is one white person who was at my wedding and has also been to my house within the last year to eat garlic-parm chicken wings and talk shit about white people\u2014a standard requirement of friendship for me. But while I do consider her a friend, she was my wife\u2019s friend first, and I\u2019m not a friend pirate, so I\u2019m not going to claim friend dibs on her.\n\nDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s something wrong with this?\n\nNot at all! And if you look at the statistics, this is perfectly normal. Less than 10 percent of the average black person\u2019s friends are white\u2014and I think that number is a little high\u2014and the average white person has exactly one black friend (which also happens to be the character Rashida Jones plays in every movie she\u2019s in).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t whites and blacks be friends with each other if we want to solve racism?\n\nEh. Racism is too ingrained and complex for a few wedding invitations and GroupMe conversations to solve it. We haven\u2019t even solved Tupac\u2019s murder yet, and he was killed in front of 34,374,984 witnesses. How the fuck are we gonna solve racism?\n\nOn an individual level, though, interracial friendship is great if it happens organically, but racial empathy and kindness are more important. And empathy and kindness can (and should) exist without friendship. I mean, I watched this Netflix documentary on humpback whales the other day, and I\u2019m very empathetic to their plight. But I ain\u2019t gonna invite one to game night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnything else you wish to add?\n\n#AllBearsMatter.", "keywords": ["dont", "im", "happen", "explained", "friendship", "black", "white", "think", "friends", "friend", "hate"], "polarity": 0.005082810447978984, "subjectivity": 0.3468960159690496},

That cashier looks just like Jared Kushner!\u201d Just \u201cWow. For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

Hodgkinson, an unemployed 66-year-old Illinois man who was upset with the politics of President Donald Trump and his Republican constituents, was hunkered down behind the third-base dugout. Hodgkinson opened fire, hitting several folks, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was struck in the hip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey, who were part of Scalise\u2019s security detail, rushed onto the field and began returning fire. According to all accounts, they prevented more lives from being lost. They held off the shooter until Alexandria police arrived. Bailey, a black man, was shot, and Griner, a black lesbian, took a bullet in the ankle. She and Scalise were taken to the hospital.\n\nScalise would take almost three months to recover. Last month a battered but not beaten Scalise returned to deliver an emotional speech on the House floor. He was using a walker; his femur was still shattered, and his hip and pelvis still damaged. He joked that the doctors had done a good job putting Humpty Dumpty back together. He talked about getting shot and lying out on the ball field and how he began praying to God. He noted that had it not been for Bailey\u2019s and Griner\u2019s bravery that day, Scalise as well as many others might not be here today. He claimed that the officers were part of his family.\n\nThis is the part of the movie where the curmudgeonly Republican who once billed himself as \u201cDavid Duke without the baggage\u201d would see the error of his ways. The part of the movie where he\u2019s visited by the Ghost of Death and shown what he might have missed out on had the very people he\u2019s been rallying against not been there to save his life. A softening of his heart would occur, and we\u2019d be proud to witness the shedding of his old ways.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, this ain\u2019t the movies, and for all of Scalise\u2019s emotional bullshit, an asshole took a bullet and almost died, but he\u2019s still an asshole. Not only has Scalise confirmed that he\u2019s willing to hobble toward his asshole agenda\u2014no less than a few days after making his return back to Congress\u2014but he\u2019s already stirring up controversial news.\n\nOne would think that after being shot and hearing the horrific news about the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the 52-year-old House majority whip would, at the least, have a slight move on gun control. Wouldn\u2019t he? Well, one would be wrong.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers believed strongly in gun rights for citizens,\u201d Scalise said during a recent appearance on Meet the Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to put new laws in place that don\u2019t fix these problems. They only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own a gun,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if he believed that the right to bear arms was \u201cunlimited,\u201d Scalise said, \u201cIt is, it is.\u201d\n\nScalise spent at least a month in the hospital undergoing several surgeries to repair his hip and pelvis. He fought off an infection and has undergone hours of rehabilitation just to be able to walk again. Surely this extensive hospital stay would, at the very least, move his needle toward supporting affordable health care, and maybe even toward single-payer, government-provided health insurance, after he realized that his life was spared because he had access to some of the best medical care in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuck no. Scalise is the kind of asshole who has been spared only so he can serve as a mouthpiece against all the things that helped save him. The Hollywood version was too perfect, so instead, this staunch, bigoted Republican who had spent his time in Congress bashing gay rights and was saved by a black lesbian, and then spent months in the hospital receiving the best care money can provide, made a miraculous recovery so that he could limp back into Congress and continue being an asshole.\n\nAs the Washington Blade reported, \u201cScalise has built over the course [of] his tenure in Congress since 2008 among the most anti-LGBT reputations of any lawmaker.\u201d And nothing has changed since he\u2019s been on the mend. The Blade further detailed Scalise\u2019s record before the shooting:\n\n\n\nEarning a \u201c0\u201d on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s congressional scorecard, Scalise voted against \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal and hate crimes protection legislation. In the last Congress, Scalise was among the 130 co-sponsors of the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill seen to enable anti-LGBT discrimination. As a member of House Republican leadership, he\u2019s responsible for the lack of votes on pro-LGBT legislation on the House floor. When Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced an amendment upholding President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive order against anti-LGBT workplace discrimination, Scalise was reportedly among House leaders who convinced seven Republicans to switch their votes to ensure the measure would fail. When a federal judge upheld Louisiana\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage as constitutional in 2014, Scalise hailed the decision during an appearance on the anti-LGBT Family Research Council\u2019s radio program as \u201can important win for marriage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince being saved by a lesbian, Scalise has reassured believers in traditional heterosexual marriage they they have nothing to fear\u2014he still hates gay marriage with the same passion he had before the shooting. He will speak this Friday at the Values Voter Summit hosted by the Family Research Council, a group of conservatives whom the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m starting to believe that there is no perfect victim, even when the victim is a congressman with the ability to effect change on a judicial level. I\u2019m starting to believe that the deaths of more than 50 innocent people at the hands of a radicalized, American-born and -bred terrorist won\u2019t be enough to move the ball forward. Currently, the debate is not over toughening gun laws or restricting the production of guns; it isn\u2019t even a debate over gun restrictions. The current argument isn\u2019t centered on making semi-automatic weapons inaccessible to citizens; it\u2019s on bump stocks\u2014a device that can make a semi-automatic weapon fire like a machine gun.\n\n\u201cThey want, somehow, some transformational event to happen that\u2019s going to convert somebody\u2019s political viewpoints,\u201d Scalise said in an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Scalise, we do. Or, if nothing else, we want the tragedy, the personal tragedy of gun violence that almost killed you, to affect you. We want your cold heart to soften around bigoted views. We want you to be ... human.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that Kennedy was charged with robbery in federal court Friday and faces 20 years in prison for allegedly robbing the New York-New York Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nKennedy \u2014 who was already under federal supervision for a previous crime \u2014 reportedly cut off his ankle bracelet, used makeup to appear black, and robbed a cashier in a cash cage at the casino in the early morning hours of Jan. 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the cashier to give him all of her \u201chundreds, and don\u2019t mess around.\u201d\n\nHe took his $23,000 and fled the casino in a taxi cab.\n\nThere is so much to unpack here.\n\nKennedy\u2019s first mistake was robbing a casino on the strip.

Those are patrolled by the North Las Vegas Police Department, and they don\u2019t have anything to do, so they will be on you with a quickness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut seriously. Red Rock.

I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides.

Steve King (R-Iowa), July 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you\u2019re reading this, a collection of federal, state and local law-enforcement officers are furiously trying to figure out why Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music concert from a Las Vegas hotel window. The egregious act has left authorities baffled as to why he mowed down dozens of concertgoers in yet another mass shooting.\n\nWithout any proof whatsoever, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has speculated that the mass murderer was mentally ill. Others have reasoned that it was probably the result of the anti-anxiety medication Paddock was taking.\n\nUnlike terrorism, drug arrests, traffic stops, gang-related shootings, or other crimes ascribed to people of certain races, ethnicities or religions, no one has made the case that massacres and mass shootings are almost exclusively the territories of white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween 1982 and 2012, 55.9 percent of the mass shootings in America were committed by white men, according to a detailed list compiled by Mother Jones. Only 16 percent were committed by blacks. But that fact is never mentioned, for one reason:\n\nIndividuality is a white privilege.\n\nThe singularity of whiteness is the main reason Caucasians object to any mention of racism without \u201cNot all white people.\u201d They do not tolerate the collective whiteness that they simultaneously use to excuse mass incarceration, racial profiling, police brutality and the phrase: \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey live with the advantage of not feeling embarrassed by The Real Housewives of Orange County. They don\u2019t worry about being stopped when driving through an area while police are searching for a Hispanic male suspect. Former Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s policy presented no threat to them. The drug war does not affect them. Their daughters are not expelled from school more often when they commit rule infractions.\n\nThe privilege of white individuality makes them immune to the school-to-prison pipeline, mass incarceration, Transportation Security Administration searches, school underfunding, banks charging higher interest rates, employers eliminating them because of the name on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, or the countless other presuppositions that blacks, Hispanics and Muslims live with every day.\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nIt must be nice to walk into a high-end store and not raise suspicion. To live in whichever neighborhood you can afford must feel like freedom. Walking around carefree with a machine gun on your shoulder without law-enforcement officers challenging your constitutional rights is probably so empowering. I can\u2019t imagine what it feels like not having to show the whites of your teeth and make an announcement before you slowly reach for a driver\u2019s license. When a white child leaves home in the family car, do Caucasian parents watch the front doorknob until their child returns home without a bullet in his or her head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this is too intense for you, let\u2019s pause for a joke from a friend who works as a criminal-defense attorney, which she says was told to her by a white circuit court judge:\n\nQuestion: What do you call a white criminal? Answer: Somone who deserves a second chance. Question: What do you call a black criminal? Answer: A thug.\n\nSomeone who neds to be taken off the streets.\n\nPrisoner No. 10294842\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is the privilege they live with. When they don pink pussy hats and march for women, they aren\u2019t considered part of some \u201chate group.\u201d When a white criminal shoots a cop, it\u2019s not because of White Lives Matter. White criminals are not \u201cthugs.\u201d White school shooters are \u201ctroubled.\u201d\n\nWhen they protested Justine Damond\u2019s death by cop, they weren\u2019t castigated for being anti-cop. When they talk about the decline of our country, it is never viewed as \u201cun-American\u201d or \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d When they say we need to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d no one told them to \u201cgo back to Europe.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because whiteness is the default in this America. That is why the phrase \u201cwhite people\u201d is offensive to them. \u201cWhite\u201d exists only in the singular form. They do not have to navigate a world where the color of their skin predetermines their credit, their employment, their education, their criminality or even their ability to breathe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the instances when they commit an atrocity that is most commonly perpetrated by white men, even when experts and analysts break their necks searching for a motive, their invisible entitlement excuses them from having to join a collective, impromptu prayer circle.

Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows?

But it does.\n\nMoving on ... so you live in Pittsburgh, right?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you attended a mixed-race high school and a predominantly white college?\n\nCorrect.\n\nHow does one live that life and never have any white friends?\n\nOh, I\u2019ve definitely had white friends. I had a white kid at the birthday slumber party I had when I was 10, and (at least) two of my white teammates in college were friends. Just right now, in 2018, I don\u2019t happen to have any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Damon Young\n\nSo you\u2019re not cool with any white people at all?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that either. There\u2019s a group of guys I\u2019ve been playing basketball with once a week for a decade. Most of them are white, and I\u2019m quite friendly with many of them. Some I\u2019d even call homies.

He cool.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also the dozens of white people I see on a regular basis in coffee shops and at the Ace Hotel (where I do much of my work) and in my neighborhood. These are people I speak to regularly. Some I like more than others, but that\u2019s true for everyone, I guess.\n\nThese sound like friends.\n\nMaybe they do to you. But there\u2019s a difference between a friend and someone you happen to like and happen to be very friendly with. For instance, there are maybe 20 people I interact with on a regular basis through text, email, Google Hangouts, Slack and Facebook. With many of these people, I have the types of private conversations and share the types of inside jokes that would either be too irrelevant or too inappropriate to share publicly. The insularity of these interactions is trusting, connecting and intentional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are some of the people I consider friends, and none of them are white. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve intentionally barred white people from friendship\u2014just that, considering my friendship criteria, none right now would qualify.\n\nAnd just so you don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me\u2014that there are white people out there who consider me a friend but it\u2019s just not reciprocated\u2014I\u2019ve been invited to maybe 20 weddings in the last five years. Do you want to guess how many of those invitations were from white people?\n\nZero?\n\nActually, two. But these were from white people who happen to be friends with my wife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I will say that there is one white person who was at my wedding and has also been to my house within the last year to eat garlic-parm chicken wings and talk shit about white people\u2014a standard requirement of friendship for me. But while I do consider her a friend, she was my wife\u2019s friend first, and I\u2019m not a friend pirate, so I\u2019m not going to claim friend dibs on her.\n\nDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s something wrong with this?\n\nNot at all! And if you look at the statistics, this is perfectly normal. Less than 10 percent of the average black person\u2019s friends are white\u2014and I think that number is a little high\u2014and the average white person has exactly one black friend (which also happens to be the character Rashida Jones plays in every movie she\u2019s in).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t whites and blacks be friends with each other if we want to solve racism?\n\nEh. Racism is too ingrained and complex for a few wedding invitations and GroupMe conversations to solve it. We haven\u2019t even solved Tupac\u2019s murder yet, and he was killed in front of 34,374,984 witnesses. How the fuck are we gonna solve racism?\n\nOn an individual level, though, interracial friendship is great if it happens organically, but racial empathy and kindness are more important. And empathy and kindness can (and should) exist without friendship. I mean, I watched this Netflix documentary on humpback whales the other day, and I\u2019m very empathetic to their plight.

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

She\u2019s an early riser like me, so we have high-energy conversations at obnoxious hours of the morning when everyone else is still asleep. But I was on deadline this particular day, so I blew a kiss at the smiling, tabloid-sized photo of her on my screen and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back, girl\u201d (because it\u2019s much less offensive to avoid someone\u2019s call if you say something gentle and sweet as you ignore them).\n\nThirty seconds later, my phone lit up again. She was chain calling before 7 a.m. It must be important, I thought.\n\nIt was. She replied to my hello with a throaty sob, the kind that\u2019s so guttural it\u2019s silent at first, and I wondered for a beat if we\u2019d been disconnected. Then her voice cracked in a series of small, helpless heaves. All I said was \u201cTake your time\u201d and waited for her swell of emotion to subside.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 43,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cand I\u2019m still trying to accomplish the things I said I would do when I turned 30. I feel like I\u2019m still waiting on life to start. Nothing is happening. I wasted my life.\u201d\n\n\n\nI wished I was able to pull her in for a hug of solidarity. That\u2019s a lonely place to be, that chasm of underachievement, and I didn\u2019t want her to stand in it alone. But I was miles away, teetering on an emotional, me-too response that would have affirmed her fears, not assuaged them, so instead I said, \u201cGirl, you are doing just fine right where you are. And if you woke up today, that means it ain\u2019t over.\u201d It felt clich\u00e9, but it was true.\n\n\n\nWhen her initial sadness passed, she explained what set her off. If you\u2019ve never spiraled before, God bless, because it\u2019s easy as hell to do. Start with one issue that panics, worries or saddens you, pile on several just-barely related issues that seem to support the direness of the first one, and go on and slide down that dark hole of despair.\n\n\n\nHers started when she regretted not snatching the chance to do a travel-intensive fellowship when she was a 20-something college student. Her parents dissuaded her then, warning her that it was an unprofitable risk, and now she\u2019s feeling gun-shy about applying for a similar program because she\u2019ll be the most senior person in the group, maybe even the entire graduate department. It will be uncomfortable, bordering on awkward, to be old enough to be her classmates\u2019 mama but still on their level, in the thick of the learning and experiencing she thinks she should have checked off two decades ago.\n\n\n\nThis is a recent story, but conversations like this have been going on in my tiny corner of the world since I was in my late 20s. It\u2019s happened with sister girls, new associates, former co-workers, college friends and even random women who confide in other women\u2014something we often do when we\u2019re having a moment and just need to blurt out what\u2019s bothering us.\n\n\n\nWe are always warring with time (\u201cWe\u201d as in \u201cme too\u201d). There\u2019s a palpable and normalized hurry imposed on black women to perfect life early. The safety net to make the young and goofy mistakes humans make when they are young and goofy is rarely afforded to us. Our missteps scar our life r\u00e9sum\u00e9s as opportunities gone to waste and we\u2019re continuously reminded of them, particularly when the things we do later don\u2019t immediately flourish or succeed at all. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d \u201cCould\u2019ve done that.\u201d White women, by comparison, are allowed to discover themselves, experience failures and setbacks, and laugh about them at Panera over coffee and cinnamon scones with their friends years later.\n\nSo we berate ourselves. We judge ourselves. We limit ourselves because we think we\u2019ve learned better from that one time it didn\u2019t work out. Risk becomes an unwelcome troublemaker, not the keystone of adventure and full-life living.\n\n\n\nListen, black girls still blooming in your late 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond: You are not done. Yes, we live in a culture that continues to level up on what constitutes \u201cextraordinary\u201d and celebrates achievement on an ever-shortening timeline. Yes, the entire world seems wholly consumed with millennials and intoxicated by great accomplishments done early (a Ph.D. by 25! An empire built in a college dorm! A nuclear family by 28! A multimillion-dollar company by 30!), but your art, your business, your invention, your ideas, your book, your contributions\u2014whatever you have in you to give\u2014is still urgent and necessary.\n\n\n\nLife has not passed you by. It\u2019s not too late to do the thing you and/or other people have been swearing you\u2019re too old to do. Folks will occasionally doubt you. You will occasionally doubt you. Do the thing you want to do anyway. Be Aunt Viv in a pink leotard, back-spinning and floor-posing on them fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack girls with some age on them are having a shining moment. You know what I appreciate about comedian Tiffany Haddish, beside the fact that she\u2019s my hilarious friend-in-my-head? She ain\u2019t 25 coming into her season in the sun. Neither is Regina Hall, who is arguably a more visible, popular and in-demand actress now than she\u2019s ever been. Neither is M\u00e9lisande Short-Colomb, who, at 63, just finished her freshman year at Georgetown.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t experience a personal milestone until you\u2019re in your fourth or fifth or sixth decade\u2014buy your first house, win an award, start a business, travel internationally for the first time\u2014you still bought a house, won an award, started a business and traveled internationally. Some of our best opportunities don\u2019t present until later. It doesn\u2019t matter when you bloom, just as long as you bloom.\n\nWe just turned the corner into 2018, and the reset of another year will surely flare some time and age-related fears and inadequacies. Inevitably, another friend will call me in frenzied tears about the betrayal of a timeline, maybe while she\u2019s setting goals or framing what this fresh set of 365 days should look like. I\u2019m not above being the friend doing the weepy calling to someone else, either. Once upon a time, I dreamed of being on a 30-under-30 list of successful writers\u2014then, when that didn\u2019t work out in time, a 40-under-40 list. Now I anticipate the rich surplus of blessings that accumulate in the holding pattern. I know God better cash out.

How do I talk about this with my new black friend?\n\nNah.\n\nDon\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re probably not ready for a black friend right now.

Racist shit wasn\u2019t a disqualifying factor for you, sooooo \u2026\n\nI\u2019m having a dinner party at my house. What should I ask them to bring?\n\nMacaroni and cheese. Trust me. Black people excel in the macaroni arts. That or potato salad if you plan on having it served. Otherwise, we won\u2019t eat the potato salad, and your macaroni game is gonna come up short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlay to your black friend\u2019s strengths. In fact, you should plan the meal in anticipation of some bomb-ass macaroni and work from there. If your new black friend makes shitty macaroni, chances are they don\u2019t have many black friends, either, and y\u2019all were never gonna work out anyway.\n\nThey\u2019ve invited me over to a barbecue. What should I bring?\n\nThis one\u2019s dicey because, in your mind, you\u2019re probably thinking that you should answer their call as if it\u2019s some kind of cultural exchange where you\u2019ll have some of their native dishes and you\u2019ll bring one of yours in kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen it comes to how the food is seasoned, prepared, cooked and presented, you gotta really have a thorough understanding of the black folks you\u2019re dealing with before you just start showing up with random shit. Is this a pork house or a nonpork house? Are they cool with coleslaw? Is this a Hennessy or a Remy family? Too many variables, man. Don\u2019t chance it. Besides, they\u2019re going to ask you to bring a nonperishable item to keep it simple for you, so chances are you\u2019re getting plates anyway.\n\n\n\nBut if you do start feeling inspired and want to make your Oma\u2019s special-recipe green-bean-and-wheat salad, stop. Don\u2019t bring that shit. No one\u2019s gonna touch it because we\u2019re not that polite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext thing you know, the party\u2019s over and there\u2019s a whole uneaten casserole sitting on the counter and you done hurt your own feelings. Just bring cups and napkins. Black folks love napkins. You can never go wrong with napkins \u2026 or ice, \u2019cause we know Marvin an\u2019nem always forget that shit.\n\nWhen do I get to use the n-word?\n\nNever. The answer is never. Not even if you stay friends for the next 55 years and find yourselves sitting next to each other in the home whilst Wu-Tang plays in the background of your bingo game. It\u2019s \u201cShame on a nuh\u201d for you forever. Forever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to keep your black friend, don\u2019t ever use that word.\n\nI don\u2019t see race, so why should I treat my black friend(s) any differently?\n\nSee, that\u2019s where you fucked up from the jump. Anybody who cops the \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d plea is immediately suspect to all black people. Saying that you don\u2019t see race is essentially admitting that you\u2019re so willing to deny your own biases that you\u2019ll revoke part of someone else\u2019s identity to make you feel better about your inadequacies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Allow me to put it another way.\n\nWould you trust a doctor who said they didn\u2019t see or believe in cancer? Hell nah, you wouldn\u2019t. Anybody who denies that an illness exists is immediately disqualified from treating said illness. So if you\u2019re trying to be our white friend but ignore our blackness, how you gonna stand on our side when we actually have to confront racism?\n\nYou can\u2019t and you won\u2019t because you\u2019re choosing your own comfort over our struggle. We\u2019ll never really be friends, but we will let you order the fight and bring five of our other black-that-you-don\u2019t-see homies to your crib with one six-pack between us and pillage your snack table off GP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t take black folks for granted, and we won\u2019t have to take you to task.", "keywords": ["dont", "youre", "shit", "youve", "black", "know", "race", "person", "guide", "decided", "bring", "friends", "friend", "really", "beginners"], "polarity": 0.022966471753785193, "subjectivity": 0.47086954297775147},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt. But it sounded like a bark and his mama named it a bark, so we gonna call it a bark.)\n\n", "keywords": ["walk", "start", "turn", "words", "problematic", "maybe", "mbaku", "speak", "barking", "white", "bark", "wakandan", "need", "wakanda", "woof"], "polarity": 0.046005889515817903, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

These people and several hundred others were allegedly shot by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as he took position on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and fired thousands of rounds down on concertgoers during a Jason Aldean show.\n\n\n\nToday, as well as in the coming days and weeks, the conversation will turn to the role that the availability of high-powered weapons has on America\u2019s unique predilection for mass shootings. Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle. There have been and will continue to be very passionate rebukes of Sanders and Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association and white maleness, and very smart people will offer possible solutions to this unsolvable problem.\n\nAnd then, when another mass shooting happens next month or next year or tomorrow in Austin, Texas, or Youngstown, Ohio, or Durham, N.C., or Denver, the same thing will happen again. Nothing will change.\n\nIt\u2019s with this context that I\u2019m left to wonder exactly how many white people would have to die in a mass shooting before America\u2019s collective will to stop this from happening again would surpass its zeal and yearning for guns. Which number would serve as the critical mass?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know, after Sandy Hook, that the deaths of 20 young schoolchildren weren\u2019t enough. And if the senseless murder of children affects us, I don\u2019t know, 10 times as much as the murders of adults do, then we can extrapolate and presume that 200 people murdered in a mass shooting wouldn\u2019t be enough, either.\n\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s no accident that the headline of this piece includes a qualifier for whiteness. It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control. If there are roughly 40 million black people here, then roughly 40 million black people would have to die. Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist. No need for night-lights if all the bogeymen are dead.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, what is the number? 250? 500? 600? 1,300? 2,200? 57,000?

Definitely your friendships. Because if there is one shining moment in the disturbing horror that is Get Out, it\u2019s Chris\u2019 ever-present, ever-woke, ever-common-sense-spouting best friend, Rod Williams of \u201cthe T.S. Muthafuckin\u2019 A.\u201d\n\n\n\nRod didn\u2019t just counsel Chris through horror; he Googled a missing black man, called the family and called the cops. And when that didn\u2019t work, he came rushing in to save the day faster than you can say, \u201cRose, get the keys!\u201d\n\nBut why should Chris be the only lucky one? There have to be other ride-or-die friends in black pop culture, right? Below is the definitive list of friends from TV you have to have to survive a job, dating, life or getting coagulated by your white girlfriend\u2019s parents.\n\n\n\nThe shows making the Rod-ship list have three criteria:\n\n\n\nThe show has to be about one main black person with a friend. So that cuts out ensemble shows like Empire , Black-ish , Girlfriends and Living Single. It also cuts out Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder because the two women featured on those shows have no friends.\n\nThe characters have to be friends, first and foremost. No brewing romantic or sexual tension. So Noah and Rosalee from Underground don\u2019t count. We all knew that relationship was coming.\n\nThey can\u2019t be immediate family, so all those brothers and sisters on Greenleaf and Queen Sugar are out, too.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the countdown:\n\n\n\n8. Molly Carter, Insecure\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMolly Carter is petty, self-absorbed and selfish. Nobody would\u2019ve known \u201cBroken Pussy\u201d was about her if she hadn\u2019t made a big deal about it. Plus, why would Issa Dee take relationship advice from a woman who managed to run Jidenna out of her bed? However, when the drama is high, Molly comes through. She is willing to leave a vacation to help Issa fix things with Lawrence, and she even runs interference with Daniel at the work party. Even Rod would let a good friend make some bad choices.\n\n\n\n7. Alfred \u201cPaper Boi\u201d Miles, Atlanta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, Alfred \u201cPaper Boi\u201d Miles is not a violation of Rule No. 3. He and Earn are cousins who weren\u2019t close; Earn really only started hanging around because he wanted to manage Paper Boi from the drug game to the rap game. If you\u2019re like Earn, and your parents kick you out and you\u2019re bouncing between your ex-girlfriend/mother of your child\u2019s house and a storage shed, Paper Boi\u2019s open couch with the blunt burns is a sign of true friendship. Paper Boi is just as likely to get you arrested as make you some money, but anybody willing to strong-arm a promoter to get you that $700 you desperately need definitely passes the Rod test. Honorable mention to Darius, who\u2019s been missing for some time now.\n\n\n\n6. Greg Wuliger, Everybody Hates Chris\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg is the first nonblack person on this list, but he\u2019s earned his spot as Chris\u2019 one (and only) friend at Corleone Junior High. Greg was no good in a fight, but he stuck it out with Chris when he could\u2019ve abandoned him to racist bullies. Racial loyalty, no matter from whom it comes, is a huge component of Rod-level friendship. Greg is also based on Chris Rock\u2019s real-life only white friend at his Bed-Stuy high school during the \u201970s, and that adds credibility.\n\n\n\n5. Tommy Egan, Power\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know Tommy seems ranked pretty high for a guy who almost shot Ghost for the Russians last season, but 1) We\u2019ll all be working for the Russians soon, and 2) Ghost kinda had it coming. Tommy exemplifies some of the most critical \u201cRod-ness\u201d characteristics out there. He may sound crazy, but Tommy has been right about damn near everything, from not trusting Angela to killing Lobos quickly, as well as pointing out Ghost\u2019s epidemic levels of ain\u2019t-shit-ness to Tasha. Tommy\u2019s loyalty to Ghost runs so deep that during a drug-fueled fight with Holly (RIP), he brought Rule No. 2 into question. Either way, if Rod were white, he might sound a little bit like Tommy.\n\n\n\n4. Dean Ella Grace Caldwell, The Quad\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDean Ella Grace Caldwell is the only friend President Eva Fletcher has on The Quad. However, she provides insight, gives Dr. Fletcher a sounding board and certainly knows more about HBCUs than Eva, having graduated from Hillman. (See what I did right there?) Plus, unlike any of the previous friend entries, Dean Caldwell\u2019s loyalty to Dr. Fletcher has never been in question. An honorable mention goes to Georgia A&M\u2019s football coach, Hardwick. However, given how Dr. Fletcher has been slaying men left and right since coming to Atlanta, she\u2019ll probably violate Rule No. 2 with him by the season finale.\n\n\n\n3. Kara, Being Mary Jane\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery black woman (or man) who\u2019s ever made it anywhere in corporate America has a friend like Kara. Kara can play the not-black Latina card but has tied herself to Mary Jane both professionally and personally since their days in Atlanta. Would Kara steal a car to save Mary Jane from a burning house after she was forced to stab David in the neck? Definitely, because the show starts at 8 and M.J. is due in makeup at 6:30.\n\n\n\n2. Claire Temple, Luke Cage\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know Claire Temple is skirting on the edges of Rule No. 2, but she and Luke were mostly friends on the show, and even by the season finale, they had never gotten around to having that \u201ccoffee.\u201d Claire did everything a Rod-level friend would do: She saved Luke\u2019s life, protected him from the cops, did a background check on him and made peace with his one-night stand. How many friends would drive you from Harlem to rural Georgia just to work out your issues? And pay for gas? She never did that for Daredevil.\n\n\n\n1. Reggie Vaughn, Survivor\u2019s Remorse\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue Rod-level friendship requires longevity, sacrifice, humor and an ability to save your boy from his own bad choices. Reggie Vaughn is all of those things to Cam Calloway. Again, this isn\u2019t quite a violation of Rod Rule No. 3. Reggie is Cam\u2019s cousin; they weren\u2019t raised by the same woman. So even under black \u201cplay cousin\u201d rules, he still slips in.\n\nReggie is the REAL MVP of black friends. He loves Cam unconditionally, and even though they\u2019re around the same age, Reggie keeps Cam; his crazy sister, M-Chuck; and Cam\u2019s mama out of trouble. Literally every other episode, Reggie does his best Rod impression, telling Cam over the phone about the best way to handle some situation in life, love or the NBA. Also, like Rod, Reggie is the kind of friend who\u2019ll tell you to settle down with a nice woman, and the only coagulation Cam\u2019s girlfriend, Allison, does is in the nursing ward.", "keywords": ["rule", "black", "woman", "white", "rod", "rideordie", "friends", "paper", "friend", "tv", "chris", "reggie"], "polarity": 0.06867710944026731, "subjectivity": 0.503271512113617},

There\u2019s Sean Hannity, who suspected \u201csecret sperm\u201d in Kehinde Wiley\u2019s depiction of Barack Obama. Which, hopefully, marks the very last time I have to write \u201csperm\u201d and \u201cSean Hannity\u201d in the same sentence, unless it\u2019s \u201cSean Hannity was eaten by a sperm whale?!?!\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the Darth Cheeto himself, who reportedly \u201cjoked\u201d that a friend of Karen McDougal\u2019s\u2014a former Playboy Playmate who claims she had an affair with Trump\u2014liked \u201cthe big black dick.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is this fascination telling us? I\u2019m not sure. Who knows what lurks in the hearts and loins of peak whiteness? But considering what we know of Donald Trump, it does feel like a bit of projection. Perhaps he hypersexualizes black men because he\u2019s the one out here fucking everyone. He\u2019s the one acting how black men are stereotypically supposed to act. He\u2019s the immoral one who refuses to curtail his sexual urges. He\u2019s the savage.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d bet all the cash in Wakanda that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ain\u2019t the only women he\u2019s slept with while married to Melania. Of course, if two adults consent to sleeping with each other, there\u2019s nothing legally wrong with that, even if one is engaged in an extramarital affair. Morally? Definitely, but it\u2019s not illegal. Perhaps Married Donald is the white Wilt Chamberlain. Or, better yet, Wilt Chamberlain is the black Married Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, he\u2019s just doing what America and white Americans have done since America\u2019s inception, which is do dirt and then claim dark people are inherently dirty.\n\n", "keywords": ["slept", "wilt", "black", "sean", "married", "white", "donald", "trump", "chamberlain", "hes", "hannity", "theres", "sperm", "whos", "women"], "polarity": -0.03897849462365592, "subjectivity": 0.4680286738351255},

My daughter isn\u2019t actually 2 years old yet. She\u2019ll be 2 next month. But I remember, before she was born, making fun of parents who\u2019d tell you their child\u2019s age in months instead of years. And then I became one of those parents. So today, this is me attempting (and likely failing) not to be a hypocrite.\n\nParenthood, so far, has been an anthology of those moments: a salmagundi of shit you said you\u2019d never do and thought you\u2019d never do and find yourself doing. Saturday morning, for instance, my daughter and I choreographed a dance to the \u201cElmo\u2019s World\u201d theme song. I\u2019m a slightly better-than-terrible dancer, and she\u2019s 23 months old, so it wasn\u2019t a complicated dance. It was basically just a pared-down version of the cabbage patch. But if you had told me 10 years ago that I\u2019d be caught cabbage-patching to Elmo, I\u2019d first wonder why you had such an arbitrarily specific vision of my future. And then I\u2019d ask who kidnapped me because this act must clearly be something my captors are forcing me to do.\n\nI also never thought a tiny person who still sleeps for half the day would possess the power to hurt my feelings. But that happens a little whenever I\u2019m trying really, really, really hard to make her laugh and she looks at me like she\u2019s a clerk at the DMV explaining to someone in line that they completed the wrong form and need to go back to the back of the line. Sometimes I want to scream, \u201cEVERYONE ON THE INTERNET THINKS I\u2019M FUNNY; PLEASE LAUGH AT ME, YOU TINY TYRANT!\u201d But then she\u2019ll look at me and say, \u201cSnack, please.\u201d Which means I need to hold my tears and go find her some blueberries.\n\nMostly, though, I never imagined being as invested in someone\u2019s growth and survival and happiness as I am with hers. My primary jobs as a parent, I\u2019ve learned, are to 1) keep her alive and safe and healthy, 2) do whatever I can to help her grow and mature and reach her potential and 3) get the fuck out of the way when getting the fuck out of the way is necessary so that I don\u2019t stunt that growth and limit that potential.\n\nAnd I, like all other parents, am learning on the job. I make mistakes and hope these mistakes prove to be inconsequential. I try to remove all of the weird and awkward and unflattering parts of me and give her nothing but the good stuff. Which I know is a fool\u2019s errand because if that stuff is a part of me, it\u2019s a part of her, too, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from trying. And I want to fill her with hope and a metaphysical limitlessness. I want her to exist as if walls and ceilings and gravity haven\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I need to separate this from the feeling that I am also possessed with that she needs to be protected from her country\u2014her home.\n\nLike the rest of the country this morning, I woke up to the terrible news of the terrorist attack in Las Vegas. When I first hear about these types of mass shootings, they remind me of lightning bolts. So sudden and random in their devastation. And largely unpreventable. What could you possibly do to prevent yourself from being somewhere where someone just decides to start shooting?\n\nThat initial feeling dissipates, though, when remembering that, like avoiding water and trees and open spaces and polelike objects when thunderstorms strike, there are substantive ways to help limit the chances of something like Las Vegas happening. But America isn\u2019t interested enough in doing those things. It continues to choose, instead, to allow itself to clutch and horde increasingly efficient human-killing devices to guard itself against some existential and nonexistent racial threat. America is so guilt filled about what it\u2019s done to nonwhite people\u2014and so fearful of retribution\u2014that it\u2019s willing to kill itself in order to keep itself armed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is the country my 23-month-old daughter lives in. It is also a country where her president and her government are openly antagonistic toward people who happen to be black and happen to female\u2014two things she happens to be. It\u2019s a country where the mere acknowledgment that\u2014because she happens to be black and happens to be female\u2014she might have different adversities to face from someone who is only one of (or neither of) those things is met with violent resistance.\n\nMy wife and I have, to the best of our abilities, childproofed our house to protect her from the kamikaze streak young children have. We feed her nothing but organic foods; a month ago, a family member attempted to give her a piece of a Kit Kat, and she bit into it and made a face like she\u2019d just swallowed bird poop. We\u2019re going to teach her Spanish and French, arming her with a trilingual and door-opening weapon. We plan to encourage her to play sports so that she\u2019s equipped with whatever positive attributes being on a team and participating in a competitive physical activity will give her.\n\nAlthough, once she comes of age, she\u2019ll be free to choose and practice whichever religious beliefs she feels comfortable with, we\u2019re raising her as a Christian. We take her to church with us and we pray for and with her, equipping her with a spiritual shield. We even started protecting her before she was born, choosing to wait until we were financially capable of providing a comfortable life for her before having her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut she was born in a place\u2014in a country\u2014where tens of millions of her countrymen are devoted, unconsciously and intentionally, to making her less safe and her already precious life more tenuous. As her dad, I\u2019m willing to do whatever I need to do in order for her life to continue and be good.

I wore African print, consumed a little more chicken than usual and kept hot sauce in my bag #Swag.\n\n\u201cAdulting\u201d has taught me that definitions vary from person to person, and this can also be said for common sense during this year\u2019s Black History Month. Every February, my idea of celebration involves paying tribute to those who have paved numerous roads and indulging in the greatness that is melanin. For others, this simple concept was hard to grasp and even harder to execute. In 2017, the year of my Lord and Savior, there were still some folks who were out in this world confused about how to properly celebrate Black History Month.\n\nSince I am an altruistic Christian who is always working on my admission into heaven, I feel it is my duty to help the beige on their journey not to embarrass themselves in 2018. This alone will probably secure my seat at Jesus\u2019 table:\n\n1. Remember: Like black lives, spelling matters.\n\nWhen you\u2019re honoring prominent figures in the black community, it is imperative that you spell their names correctly. Your tribute becomes void for even the simplest of mistakes. You end up looking racist or as if you don\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am here to tell you that Google is still a free service and will save you from the embarrassment that will ensue if you post an incorrect name. Hey, wypipo, quick history lesson: W.E.B. Du Bois \u2260 W.E.B DeBois; be better than the Department of Education. The last thing America needs is for you to tap into your inner Betsy DeVos.\n\n2. A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to celebrate one of the many great acts of black people, it is helpful to put the correct face with the name. If you are honoring a woman who freed herself from slavery, it\u2019s best to use a photo of her and not her alleged descendant Johnny Depp. Your Black History Month post doesn\u2019t hold the same weight when you place someone who is taupe out in front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe better than 45\u2019s administration, and don\u2019t spread #AlternativeFacts. Don\u2019t be like the Grammys and think we all look alike, and remember that, contrary to Tangerine Mussolini\u2019s beliefs, we do not all know each other. And I promise I will personally find you and slap the unseasoned food out of your mouth if you ever place a piece of fried chicken near any prominent figure in our history.\n\n3. Know the history.\n\nIf you are like Vice President Mike Pence, you probably think that shouting out a white man during Black History Month is cool, but it\u2019s not. I know it\u2019s hard to wrap your mind around the idea that black history started before slavery, and I know it may be difficult to fathom anything having started without white influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, in all my melanin-filled glory, am here to tell you that we don\u2019t just arbitrarily call it the Motherland. There were kingdoms, inventors, intellectuals and thriving cultures before anyone was forced to leave their countries. We even have an entire museum in Washington, D.C., depicting our history. Take a look\u2014it might change your life and Black History Month display boards. Making your Pinterest boards a reality and neglecting to add melanin doesn\u2019t speed your cause forward; it stops it in its tracks.\n\nAs mentioned, I know a lot of you think we all look alike, but this is one time that you need not make that public mistake. A mistake like confusing Rosa Parks with Harriet Tubman will fill your life with more trouble than you ever intended. No one will think that you wanted Tubman to take a seat to relax from her tireless work of freeing our people; they\u2019ll just think you\u2019re racist.\n\n4. Forget referencing your \u201cblack friend.\u201d\n\nYes, kudos to you for acquiring some diversity in your circle of friends, but this does not warrant a medal and is not something to boast about. You will not become any more relatable to any black person by telling him or her that you have a black friend. It teeters along the lines of racism\u2014actually, it Dougies smooth the hell over the line, and now you\u2019re that fluorescent appropriating person. We can\u2019t all be Adele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Celebrities are cool, but black folks are more than a famous face.\n\nSure, it\u2019s cool to shout out M.J. (pick one) or talented muva Beyonc\u00e9, but there is more to our history than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. If you\u2019re an educator, take this opportunity to immerse your classroom in the hidden figures that may be lost to you.\n\nTry a day without using a black invention; it\u2019s hard. If you\u2019re just an average, run-of-the-mill ecru person, read a book and find out how you can be an ally to the cause. You don\u2019t need an Oprah\u2019s Lifeclass lesson on how to be a good person; you just need to let Google be the friend it was placed on this earth to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Know your culinary lane.\n\nYes, our food is amazing\u2014orgasmic, even\u2014but leave the seasoning to the professionals. I know you long to partake in the divine joys of our culture\u2019s food, but this is not your lane. You may come from a people notorious for their allergy to seasoning, so a how-to tutorial on frying chicken may not be your calling or ministry. I promise you, the world will not be a better place with your gluten-free tutorial, and you are not doing any of my ancestors proud. In fact, I think they just rolled over in their graves.\n\nLawry\u2019s and pepper go a long way. And if you\u2019re an owner of a culinary establishment, you may want to shy away from stereotypical advertisements. Yes, I know it seems like a great idea between you and Becky, but trust me, Keisha won\u2019t agree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Say no to blackface.\n\nDon\u2019t be that person who is culturally insensitive and inappropriate. If you have to alter the color of your skin to portray any person or character and it\u2019s not a damn Pok\u00e9mon, you\u2019re wrong. No, seriously; I\u2019m not joking. Don\u2019t let Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s appropriation of an oompa loompa make you feel that face painting to depict a person is OK. In this case, orange is not the new black.\n\n8. #365Black.\n\nYes, these 28 or 29 days are what have been allotted to celebrate black history, but it doesn\u2019t end there. If, on March 1, you find yourself unsure or reverting to your ignorant ways of January, ask yourself if you have made any cultural changes or if you understand the contributions of black people. Furthermore, please note that doing these tributes will not guarantee you a seat at our table. You will not be rewarded or celebrated for doing what you are supposed to be doing in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving forward, I implore you all to listen with open ears, open minds and closed mouths. If you don\u2019t understand something, ask and be informed. It\u2019s better to get the answer than to live your life in a perpetual state of DeVos. If you plan to celebrate Black History Month in the future, your knowledge needs to extend beyond the current administration\u2019s. You can\u2019t be out here in the world thinking Frederick Douglass and his coiffed hair are still kicking it and fighting for my people\u2019s rights. No, you cannot make him your employee of the month.\n\nFeel free to have secret white meetings and email chains about these helpful tips.

Trump began by bigging up his favorite people in the world, the police. After his introductory statement, in which he stated that he and his fellow Americans were \u201cjoined together in sadness, shock and grief,\u201d Trump went right into his deep and abiding love of po-9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and all of the first responders for their courageous efforts and helping to save the lives of so many,\u201d he said. Trump also profusely thanked the FBI, Department of Homeland security and local authorities, saying, \u201cIt shows what true professionalism is all about.\u201d\n\nNow, I think the police in this case definitely deserve kudos for doing such a great job, but it doesn\u2019t escape me that the LVMPD is the very same department that NFL player Michael Bennett is about to sue for excessive force and an obvious lack of professionalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Trump never used the words \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d or even \u201cterrorism,\u201d for that matter. He did drop \u201cevil\u201d a few times in describing Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who is allegedly behind the attack, but one can only imagine what the response would have been if Paddock had been a \u201cGonzales\u201d or \u201cMuhammad.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether these men of color were 10th-generation Americans or not, I would bet my left foot that there would\u2019ve been some direct or indirect reference to protecting this nation and weak borders, anger frothing from his mouth and, you bet your ass, the word \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\n3. Trump is going to Vegas posthaste. \u201cI will be going to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders and the families of the victims\u201d on Wednesday, he said\u2014a marked departure from his response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, which he is waiting over a week to visit. Trump is slated to go to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday, so I guess he\u2019s not staying long, since he will be in Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Who dis man quoting the Bible? Trump looked about as comfortable as a whoremonger in an eight-pewed Baptist church while saying things like: \u201cWe ask God to help see you through this very dark period. Scripture teaches us that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. We seek comfort in those words because we know God lives in the hearts of those who grieve.\u201d\n\nThis from the man who called Second Corinthians \u201ctwo Corinthians\u201d on the campaign trail (he still got the evengelicals anyway). The man whom many view as the devil incarnate even dropped the word \u201clove\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d a few times.\n\n5. Trump noted that he has \u201cdirected that our great flag be flown at half-staff.\u201d So ... he just had to get that \u201cgreat\u201d in there, huh? This, an obvious dig at those who may kneel during the national anthem against the very brutality that Trump implicitly and explicitly condones through his sycophantic love and blind support of law enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe verdict? I would bet my bottom dollar that if this thing had gone more than five minutes, it would have gone left. What I did glean was that being a white man\u2014even a murderous one\u2014has its privileges in Trump\u2019s GREAT America.", "keywords": ["department", "terrorists", "shoot", "takeaways", "love", "white", "response", "bet", "trump", "vegas", "god", "great", "man", "trumps", "las", "men"], "polarity": 0.07859838274932615, "subjectivity": 0.4721990116801439},

She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

In fact, you don\u2019t have to search at all. If you\u2019re sitting on a chair at a cubicle right now or standing in line at Einstein\u2019s Bagels, \u201cperfectly justifiable reasons to hate the New England Patriots\u201d permeate the air and will bounce off your forehead like drops of sleet.\n\nYou can hate them because they\u2019ve been caught cheating numerous times. You can hate them because they seem to receive a mysteriously generous amount of questionable refereeing in their favor. You can hate them because they\u2019re from Boston, which is notorious for possessing the most insufferable (and insufferably racist) sports fans (and people).\n\nYou can hate them because their owner, coach and star quarterback are unabashed \u201cMAGA\u201d bots. You can hate them because they\u2019re really fucking good and they\u2019ve been really fucking good for 15 years despite never really being dominant. I\u2019ve never seen a team that, along with being great, also frequently got so damn lucky, and you can hate them for that. You can hate them because Tom Brady is Scientologist-adjacent. If you want to be petty, you can hate them because Robert Kraft is low-key ugly.\n\nAnd yes, it is fine to hate them because Bill Belichick seems to possess a white-skill-position-player generator. Wes Walker. Rob Gronkowski. Danny Woodhead. Chris Hogan. Julian Edelman. Danny Amendola. Rex Burkhead. THESE ARE NOT THE NAMES OF REAL PEOPLE! THESE ARE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE CREATED BY A WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR. Besides New England, there are, like, three white running backs and receivers in the NFL total. The Patriots, however, have 952 of them.\n\nThis cannot be a coincidence. It just can\u2019t. If you ordered a pepperoni pizza for a party and you opened the box and saw that one slice had 95 pepperonis while the other seven slices had five total, you\u2019d suspect something was up\u2014that the pizza-maker wanted one person to have all the pepperoni. You don\u2019t know why the pizza-maker made this arbitrarily specific decision, but you know a decision was made.

Words like \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d find their way into the columns and comments and news stories about them. They\u2019re \u201cgood locker-room guys\u201d and \u201ccoaches on the field.\u201d They \u201chustle\u201d and they possess an unlimited amount of \u201cguile\u201d and \u201ctoughness.\u201d Their \u201cwork ethics\u201d are impeccable because they\u2019re true \u201cstudents of the game.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Gronkowski is basically white LeBron.

These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking.

And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people.

It took at least four hours for the boy to receive medical care, because when the shot went off, police thought it was intended for officers and ducked for cover. They evacuated the family from the home, called in SWAT and set up a barricade response, trying to negotiate with the boy from outside. It wasn\u2019t until a SWAT team made entry late Wednesday that officers realized the boy had been wounded. The boy was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center as distraught relatives screamed in shock. He died at the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony and two other boys were suspected of burglary in their housing community in East Las Vegas. The police were called by a neighbor at about 2:30 p.m. that Wednesday. The neighbor was fed up with a \u201cplague\u201d of recent burglaries. While waiting for the police to arrive, the neighbor managed to catch and detain one of the boys until police arrived.\n\nThe version of the story told by Metro PD to the Review-Journal says that when they found out where Anthony lived, they went to his house and got permission to enter. Then, according to the paper:\n\nA few minutes later, officers noticed the boy hiding in the backyard, near an oleander bush, and chased him, [police spokesman Jay] Rivera said. They quickly lost the boy, who had actually ran around to the front yard, then re-entered the same home through a window and, for unknown reasons, began loading a gun in a bathroom, Rivera said. The boy didn\u2019t realize at least two officers were still inside the home. \u201cThey confront him right away, order him to put the weapon down,\u201d Rivera said. But instead, the boy ran into a connected bedroom, where officers heard one round discharge. The round did not injure police, and officers did not return fire. That\u2019s when the barricade response began.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe version told to the Review-Journal\u2019s Rachel Crosby on July 13 has not changed much in the days since. On Monday the coroner ruled Anthony\u2019s death a suicide. A GoFundMe set up to collect funeral expenses for his family has a note that maintains Anthony was shot in the back of the head, which makes for an odd placement for a suicide wound.\n\nSo what really happened to Anthony Garrett? Why are details so scarce at this point if it is a clear-cut case of suicide?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd why do these cases always end up like this? Some kid who probably would have gotten probation at the most decides that it would be better to just be dead?

I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months.

Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked.

A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["mother", "mr", "magical", "charlie", "shit", "magically", "church", "negro", "negrod", "white", "movie", "does", "reasons"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Brown, 40, was, in fact, choked to death during the May 14 encounter after a chase through the back hallways of the Venetian casino, CBS notes.\n\nNBC reports that Brown, who also used the name Tashii Farmer, had an enlarged heart and was under the influence of methamphetamine, but Coroner John Fudenberg ruled that Brown died of lack of oxygen, or \u201casphyxia due to police restraint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLopera also used a Taser on Brown seven times and punched him in the head and neck at the time of the incident, authorities said.\n\nBack in May, Lopera and Brown encountered each other before Brown suddenly started running away. Officers reported that Brown appeared to be sweating and looked panicked as he told police that people were chasing him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLopera chased Brown through an employee-only area of the hotel and a stairwell before eventually catching up with Brown outside the hotel.\n\nIt was then that Lopera grabbed his Taser and deployed his weapon at Brown multiple times before being seen punching Brown in the head and neck as Venetian security guards joined the effort and other officers arrived, authorities said.\n\nAs Brown continued to struggle, Lopera applied what has been described as a \u201crear naked choke,\u201d according to officials. During a May press conference about the incident, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that Lopera applied the choke hold for over one minute\u2014far longer than the seven to 10 seconds it may take for such a restraint to render a person unconscious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammas, however, maintains that Lopera, who lost track of his partner during the chase, believed that he was facing a combative person who was attempting to carjack a vehicle.\n\nA lawyer representing Brown\u2019s mother, Trinita Farmer, said that she had hoped Lopera would face a murder charge. The grieving mother also wants the Venetian to hold its security officers, who helped Lopera, responsible for their own actions.\n\n\u201cThere will be a time for justice.

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["dont", "flight", "im", "allies", "going", "world", "work", "airport", "know", "speak", "enemies", "white", "need", "men"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it. I can\u2019t imagine having control of the media; every part of the local, state and national government; the education system, the banking system, the economy; and politics and the entire damn country and still feeling sorry for myself like a 6-year-old who can\u2019t get an ice cream cone because he\u2019s already eaten too many cookies. Poor white people. It must be so hard being that fragile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI apologize.\n\nRead more at USA Today.", "keywords": ["im", "student", "cloud", "posters", "st", "white", "union", "hell", "ive", "state", "unapologetically"], "polarity": -0.05489299886621315, "subjectivity": 0.41078160430839017}
