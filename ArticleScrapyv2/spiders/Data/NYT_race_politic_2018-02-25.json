But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem \u2014 Chinese overproduction.\n\nYet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.\n\nAlthough China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.\n\nCanada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 \u2014 17 percent \u2014 followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.\n\n\u201cFrom a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,\u201d said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. \u201cCanada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers \u2014 as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union \u2014 stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.\n\nThe United States has been seeking South Korea\u2019s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines.\n\nIncluding countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.\n\nMany products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most \u201cmade-in-America\u201d vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.\n\nThe truck\u2019s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum works in Quebec \u2014 an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.\n\nAnother 15 percent of the value of the truck\u2019s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.\n\nThe auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.\n\nEconomists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars.\n\nThe same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.\n\nOther economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.", "keywords": ["ensnare", "china", "south", "aimed", "american", "industry", "trade", "aluminum", "united", "steel", "states", "canada", "sanctions", "trump"], "polarity": 0.07730344368275403, "subjectivity": 0.3849612073750004},

In September, that office was moved into the National Economic Council and placed under the purview of its director, Gary D. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs investor whose more conventional views on trade have contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Navarro.\n\nThe White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.\n\nWhite House trade policy has been rocked in recent weeks by the departure of Rob Porter, a former aide accused of domestic violence, who had organized regular meetings for the trade staff. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.\n\nAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt is unclear what new responsibilities Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion could bring, or whether the president could change his mind. But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.\n\nMr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nMr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.\n\nAs Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.\n\nMr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.\n\nFrom a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.\n\nIn the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.\n\nIn an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.", "keywords": ["ascendant", "peter", "white", "china", "navarros", "president", "trade", "office", "united", "mr", "house", "skeptic", "navarro"], "polarity": 0.08425676055546187, "subjectivity": 0.27828859452236077},
{"title": "\n                    Behind a Key Anti-Labor Case, a Web of Conservative Donors                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/economy/labor-court-conservatives.html", "text": "And Mr. Uihlein has donated well over $1 million over the years to groups like the Federalist Society that work to orient the judiciary in a more conservative direction. They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.\n\nThe case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.\n\nAmid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.\n\nPhoto\n\nA recent paper by Mr. Hertel-Fernandez and two colleagues may foretell what Democrats can expect if Mr. Uihlein and his fellow philanthropists succeed. It found that the Democratic share of the presidential vote dropped by an average of 3.5 percentage points after the passage of so-called right-to-work laws allowing employees to avoid paying union fees. That is larger than Democrats\u2019 margin of defeat in several states that could have reversed their last three presidential losses.\n\nAnd that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201d\n\nAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.\n\nConservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin rolled back the right of most public unions to bargain over anything other than wages and eliminated the requirement that nonmembers pay fees. The portion of unionized public-sector workers in the state plummeted from half to just over one-quarter within five years.\n\nIn seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.\n\nThe Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.\n\nIn a 2014 case brought by a group that had received more than $1 million in contributions from the Bradley Foundation, the Supreme Court ruled that home-care aides and other \u201cpartial-public employees\u201d paid through Medicaid could not be forced to pay fair-share fees if they left their unions. Unions say these fees, typically about 80 percent of standard dues, are necessary to compensate them for representing nonmembers in bargaining and grievance proceedings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring 2015 and 2016, the foundation also substantially increased its contributions, totaling well over $1 million, to groups like the Independence Institute of Colorado and the Freedom Foundation of Washington State. Those groups have used such tools as direct mail, phone calls and door knocking to persuade public-sector workers to give up union membership.\n\nRichard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.\n\nFew philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.\n\nMr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe Uihleins appear to be preoccupied with state employee pensions and the unions that negotiate them.\n\n\u201cBruce is the only one in the race who isn\u2019t beholden to public-sector unions,\u201d Mr. Uihlein said of Mr. Rauner, the year before his 2014 election as Illinois governor, in an interview with Crain\u2019s Business Chicago. The Uihleins gave more than $2.5 million to his campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.\n\nSince then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nMr. Rauner\u2019s administration has amplified the institute\u2019s message, and vice versa. In an August 2016 email to state workers, the administration highlighted a benefit of giving up union membership and urged workers to visit a website that would help them do so. The policy institute soon promoted the same website and provided similar guidance in its mailings to state workers.\n\nMr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation has supplemented these efforts by supporting a nonprofit called Think Freely Media, which uses storytelling techniques to champion free-market ideas, including right-to-work laws. The Uihlein foundation contributed more than $1.5 million to Think Freely from 2014 to 2016, the last year for which tax records are available.\n\nAt the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field. I think it was an amazing story of success.\u201d\n\nBut in other contexts, Mr. Tillman has been less conciliatory.\n\nIn a fund-raising solicitation by the policy institute in December, Mr. Tillman claimed credit for helping more than 2,600 workers leave their union, resulting in a loss of $1.2 million in union revenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Illinois to throw off the shackles of big labor and big government,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen you and I look around Illinois and see the devastation the union-dominated status quo has inflicted,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe simply have no choice.\u201d", "keywords": ["unions", "state", "donors", "key", "groups", "antilabor", "million", "mr", "2016", "case", "web", "foundation", "uihlein", "conservative", "union"], "polarity": 0.09862651815776817, "subjectivity": 0.3657816257816257},

In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["nuclear", "peace", "south", "trump", "olympics", "united", "turn", "moon", "mr", "korea", "truce", "states", "leader", "olympic", "lasting", "koreas", "north"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

Barrack Jr., the president\u2019s close friend who ran the inaugural operation.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Gates was allowed to plead guilty to just two relatively lower-level charges indicated to legal experts that he must have something of value for Mr. Mueller. The presumption in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle is that Mr. Gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against Mr. Manafort, who in turn could threaten Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Manafort participated in a meeting in June 2016 along with Donald Trump Jr., the candidate\u2019s son, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer on the promise of receiving incriminating information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of Russia\u2019s government.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Deripaska, a Russian oligarch allied with President Vladimir V. Putin who claimed Mr. Manafort owed him $19 million. Prosecutors are interested in learning how a Republican convention platform plank on Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine was watered down.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders said Mr. Gates\u2019s credibility as a witness may be tainted by the fact that one of the charges he pleaded guilty to was lying to the F.B.I. even as he was negotiating his plea deal. Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, has said that Mr. Manafort has no damaging information against Mr. Trump. Mr. Manafort insisted again on Friday that he was innocent and would fight the \u201cuntrue piled up charges.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s argument that none of this has anything to do with him resonates with many of his supporters, who have echoed his repeated insistence that there was no collusion with Russia. But being surrounded by people who are prosecuted has damaged other presidents even when they were not directly implicated.\n\nJimmy Carter endured significant political damage when his confidant and budget director, Bert Lance, was accused of banking irregularities. Even putting aside the Iran-contra scandal and the Monica S. Lewinsky affair, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were besieged by investigations of their aides unrelated to them. In Reagan\u2019s era, it became known as the \u201csleaze factor.\u201d Mr. Clinton\u2019s team drew the scrutiny of six independent counsels other than Kenneth W. Starr.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the current case, the targets so far have included not just a \u201ccoffee boy,\u201d as Mr. Papadopoulos was described by an adviser to Mr. Trump, but the president\u2019s top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Mr. Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Mr. Manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that he was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s chairman.\n\nMoreover, it remains unclear why he volunteered to work for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressure.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation, accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled by a former British spy hired by investigators working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nTo the extent that Mr. Mueller is exploring whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey, the president\u2019s defenders contend that under the Constitution, he has the power to dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work. They also point to testimony by Mr. Comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impeded.\n\nTherefore, they argue, the original order appointing Mr. Mueller was itself invalid and should be revoked.\n\nIn the meantime, they are left to interpret the clues from Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions just like everyone else. David B. Rivkin Jr., a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Reagan and President George Bush, said the totality of Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions still did not add up to a threat to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to unfold piecemeal an indictment of Russian entities and Russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case. It makes no logical sense,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, at least, what he\u2019s done does underscore that there\u2019s no collusion there. That leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which I think is constitutionally flawed and isn\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Wittes said Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions could be seen as building a pyramid \u2014 establishing that there was a Russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses. But the special counsel has not tipped his hand yet.\n\n\u201cThe basic contours of the puzzle is that he\u2019s constructed his actions in a way that we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s leading,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s on purpose.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "gaining", "president", "steam", "mr", "worry", "manafort", "mueller", "trumps", "special", "campaign", "house", "presidents", "trump"], "polarity": 0.07249893896952721, "subjectivity": 0.39003225532637287},

Founded by Brian Ballard, a lobbyist based in Tallahassee, Fla., who was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, transition and inauguration, Ballard Partners has signed contracts with government entities or political parties in Albania, the Dominican Republic, Kosovo and Turkey, all since the inauguration.\n\nThose firms, which have not been accused of impropriety, disclosed the foreign contracts to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires anyone who lobbies or does public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work and payments for it. The act is intended to prevent foreign actors from surreptitiously influencing American public policy.\n\nBut for years, many American consultants have skirted the law\u2019s requirements. Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry has focused on such undisclosed lobbying among some of its leading practitioners, including Mr. Manafort, who helped pioneer the model for international consulting three decades ago. The investigation has left other firms rushing to ensure their own compliance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is creating concern in the Washington lobbying community about not only complying with FARA, but also a new emphasis on enforcement that perhaps folks didn\u2019t think was happening or would happen,\u201d said Thomas J. Spulak, a lawyer in the Washington office of King & Spalding who specializes in lobbying compliance.\n\nMr. Mueller has scrutinized Skadden on two fronts \u2014 its own work for Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, and its role advising to two other powerhouse Washington lobbying firms paid to bolster his government, Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group.\n\nMr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates of orchestrating a complicated scheme through which Mercury and Podesta were paid about $1 million each through a nonprofit front group to advocate on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Mr. Gates admitted that he knowingly misled Skadden \u2014 though the firm is not named in court filings \u2014 in a scheme to avoid FARA registration by indicating incorrectly that the nonprofit was not supervised or controlled by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government. Relying on that information, Skadden prepared a legal opinion in 2012 that the lobbying firms used in opting not to register under FARA.\n\nSkadden\u2019s opinion, which was written by a partner, Kenneth A. Gross, and an associate, and was reviewed by The New York Times, asserted that the firms were not required to register because their client, the Brussels-based European Center for a Modern Ukraine, \u201cis a private nongovernmental organization\u201d not controlled or funded by a foreign government or political party.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Justice Department, which enforces FARA, began investigating the arrangement in 2016, and Mercury and Podesta registered, belatedly, under the act last year. The special counsel has continued looking into the matter, subpoenaing the firms for testimony about their Ukraine work.\n\nDespite Mr. Gates\u2019s admission that he misled Skadden, people who worked with Podesta and Mercury privately blame the law firm for the faulty guidance.\n\nMercury, which relied on Skadden for years for FARA advice and for assistance last year in responding to subpoenas from the special counsel, is no longer working with Skadden, according to three people in the lobbying industry who were briefed on the change.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lawrence S. Spiegel, a partner who specializes in government enforcement and white-collar crime, has been assigned to handle interactions with the special counsel, and Ms. Porter noted that the firm dismissed Mr. van der Zwaan and said that the lying charges he pleaded guilty to are \u201ccontrary to our values, policies and expectations.\u201d\n\nBut Skadden may not be able to limit its legal exposure by distancing itself from Mr. van der Zwaan if the special counsel can implicate the firm in wrongdoing in the work or payments on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics.\n\n\u201cWhy he was lying is a big question, and did anyone else at the law firm know he was lying?\u201d Ms. Roiphe said. \u201cIf he was lying for his own purposes, I don\u2019t think that knowledge would be imputed to other lawyers at the firm.\u201d\n\nThe answers to those questions are not entirely clear.\n\nMr. van der Zwaan admitted misleading prosecutors about two conversations in September 2016 with Mr. Gates and an unidentified business associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort. They discussed their belief that Skadden\u2019s work for Mr. Yanukovych exposed the firm to possible criminal charges in Ukraine. No such charges have been filed.\n\nAfter the conversation with the business associate, prosecutors said, Mr. van der Zwaan called the senior Skadden lawyer on the Ukrainian project, Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Court filings do not reveal what was discussed, and Mr. Craig was not identified by name by prosecutors.\n\nSkadden worked for the Ukrainian government on a 2012 report analyzing the prosecution of one of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s leading political rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates used an offshore account to \u201cfunnel $4 million to pay for the report,\u201d according to court papers, which note that the financial arrangement \u201cwas not disclosed.\u201d It is not clear how much of the $4 million went to Skadden.\n\nAdding a layer of intrigue, a consultant who worked on the report said that it was facilitated in part by Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a former Russian Army linguist and longtime associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort who is \u201cassessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Kilimnik did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study was used by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s allies to rebut international criticism that the prosecution and jailing of Ms. Tymoshenko was politically motivated and lacked sufficient evidence. But it was widely dismissed as a flawed attempt to paper over concerns about Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s abuses, and other lobbyists promoting Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government said they declined to promote the report for lack of credibility.\n\nSkadden did not respond to questions about the financing of its Ukraine work, but it said in a statement that the report was independent and noted that it found that Ms. Tymoshenko \u201cwas denied basic rights under Western legal standards.\u201d\n\nThe Washington lobbyists who worked on the issue with Mercury and Podesta said that Mr. Craig himself was involved in promoting the report to journalists and members of Congress \u2014 activity that experts said should have prompted FARA registration requirements.\n\nSkadden internally reviewed the FARA implications of its Ukraine work before deciding not to register, according to the consultant who worked with the firm on the report.\n\nMs. Porter, the Skadden spokeswoman, said that neither Mr. Craig nor any of the firm\u2019s other lawyers \u201cengaged in any activity that required them or the firm to register under FARA.\u201d Mr. Craig did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLess than a year and a half after the release of the Skadden report, Mr. Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia amid street protests over his government\u2019s corruption and its pivot toward Moscow. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government collapsed and Ms. Tymoshenko was freed.\n\nAnd last year, as the Justice Department was inquiring about the Ukrainian work, Skadden returned about half of the reported $1.1 million it was paid by the Ukrainian government.", "keywords": ["firm", "podesta", "work", "report", "giant", "yanukovychs", "law", "mr", "mueller", "skadden", "investigation", "foreign", "legal", "entangled", "firms"], "polarity": 0.021329145109632908, "subjectivity": 0.3270140428677013},

Lawmakers who earn an \u201cA\u201d rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office.\n\nFor candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections.\n\nThe organization\u2019s calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants a simplistic answer, which is they buy votes,\u201d said Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College and the author of \u201cGuns, Gun Control, and Elections.\u201d \u201cBut it is largely incorrect. The N.R.A.\u2019s power is more complex than people think.\u201d\n\nCompared with the towering sums of money donated to House and Senate candidates in the last cycle \u2014 $1.7 billion \u2014 the N.R.A.\u2019s direct contributions were almost a rounding error.\n\nThe N.R.A. directly donated a total of just $1.1 million to candidates for federal office in 2016, with 99 percent of that money going to Republicans, while giving a total of only $309,000 in direct contributions to state legislative candidates in 2016 and 2017, according to tallies by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks state-level donations.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose amounts are dwarfed by the largess of other major contributors. Comcast, through its political action committee and its employees, directly donated $12.7 million in the 2016 campaign cycle to federal candidates or political parties, and the committee for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, and its employees directly donated nearly $3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics tallies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.\u2019s spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members.\n\nWhen candidates waver in their support for sweeping gun rights, the group does not hesitate to turn on them. After Ted Strickland, a Democrat who earned the N.R.A.\u2019s endorsement as a candidate for governor of Ohio, backed a ban on assault weapons, the organization spent more than $1.5 million in so-called independent expenditures, like TV ads, to defeat him in a 2016 bid for the Senate.\n\nMs. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the group\u2019s board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s leadership. \u201cAt times like this, it\u2019s very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.\u201d\n\nWhile the N.R.A. cuts relatively few checks to individual lawmakers \u2014 a fact that has been noted by The Tampa Bay Times, among others \u2014 it does devote tens of millions of dollars to ads backing its preferred candidates or criticizing its opponents, often with vividly alarmist messages about crime and self-defense.\n\nThe N.R.A., through its various legal entities, raises money for its political and lobbying efforts and other activities from two primary sources: member dues and contributions from outside supporters, including gun makers like Smith & Wesson and political groups like Freedom Partners, the Koch family-backed organization.\n\nThe group has fought to keep the identity of many of its biggest contributors secret, although an audit document filed with the State of North Carolina showed that its total budget was about $420 million in 2016.\n\nThe N.R.A. spent $20 million in that year\u2019s election cycle on ads and other campaign tactics intended to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and an additional $11 million to support Donald J. Trump \u2014 money that is not marked down as a direct contribution to Mr. Trump, because the N.R.A. spent the cash on its own.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The N.R.A.\u2019s presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast fall in Virginia, where the N.R.A. is headquartered and once held commanding clout over the state government, Democrats swept all of the state\u2019s major offices after campaigning loudly against the organization. The state\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat whom the N.R.A. had targeted for defeat, said the group had insisted on defending a platform that was \u201cbecoming more and more untenable\u201d with voters in the political middle.\n\n\u201cThere were parts of the state where they wouldn\u2019t run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,\u201d Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.\u2019s campaign spending: \u201cIt did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.\u201d\n\nStill, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A.\n\nIn Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate.\n\nThe former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have \u201crun like scalded rats from the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey turn out people that already agree with them,\u201d Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. \u201cThe reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\nBut it has had major losses, too, including in the Senate special election in Alabama late last year, in which it spent money to try to defeat Doug Jones, a Democrat who challenged Roy S. Moore.\n\nOver all, the success rate of the N.R.A. ebbs and flows with political trends. With Mr. Trump on the ballot, candidates it supported directly at the federal level in 2016 won 73 percent of the time, while its preferred candidates won only 44 percent of the time in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president.\n\nIn almost all forms of spending \u2014 direct campaign contributions, independent expenditures and lobbying \u2014 gun rights groups have far outspent gun control groups in recent decades, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, spending that advocates gun control has picked up in recent years, fueled by groups backed by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in a 2011 shooting, and by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.\n\nThere have been hints in recent days, with the protests after the Parkland shooting and a string of businesses cutting ties with the N.R.A. \u2014 as well as a fiery and defensive speech delivered by its leader at a conservative conference \u2014 that the group is losing ground. Even some of its key political supporters, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, and top lawmakers in the state, have proposed measures like raising the age limit for gun purchases to 21.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Mr. Bloomberg, said he saw signs that the N.R.A.\u2019s influence was in decline, despite a surge in 2017 in federal lobbying spending by the organization. He pointed to its inability last year to get legislation through the Republican Congress that would give legal gun owners the right to carry concealed weapons outside their home states.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said. \u201cThe truth is, they are making bad bets. And they are out of sync.

Image President Trump speaking on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. The sanctions are intended to close a loophole in the effort to cut off North Korea\u2019s imports of oil and exports of coal. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump addressed a range of policy issues, from tax cuts to gun policy to immigration, at Friday\u2019s annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Below is a look at some of the facts and figures he cited that were accurate, false or could use some additional context.\n\n\u201cWe have passed massive, biggest in history, tax cuts and reforms \u2026 for 45 years nothing has been passed.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThe $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law in December are not the largest in history. According a previous analysis in The New York Times, they amount to the 12th largest, as a share of the economy.\n\nAlso, Mr. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to enact tax cuts. Tax legislation was signed into law by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Further, the cuts passed under Mr. Reagan and Mr. Obama were larger, as a share of the economy, than those recently signed by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cNo president has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term as we have cut in less than a year.\u201d\n\nEvidence is lacking.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to label actions taken by federal agencies as deregulatory and regulatory, so it\u2019s a difficult comparison to make. Previous administrations have counted the number of regulations withdrawn from the federal registry. By that metric, Mr. Trump did not eliminate more in one year than his predecessors in their entire terms.\n\n\u201cWe have massive energy reserves, we have coal, we have so much. And basically they say you can\u2019t use it.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to the Paris climate accord that his administration announced the United States was withdrawing from in June 2017.\n\nEmissions reductions under the agreement are voluntary. So, contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, coal consumption in the United States would not have necessarily been affected.\n\n\u201cChina, their agreement didn\u2019t kick in until 2030. Right. Our agreement kicks in immediately. Russia, they\u2019re allowed to go back into the 1990s, which was not a clean environmental time.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the United States offered to cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels, by 2025, as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nChina ratified the Paris agreement in September 2016. The country pledged to lower emissions after an projected peak level of emissions in 2030. But updated projections anticipate that peak will occur closer to 2020 as the Chinese government invests in renewable energy and halts production on cars that don\u2019t meet fuel efficiency standards.\n\nRussia pledged to cut emissions by 25 to 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. That is rated \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d by the Climate Action Tracker, which scores countries\u2019 pledges. Russia\u2019s economy had collapsed, causing emissions to drop rapidly, with the fall of the Soviet Union. So reducing emissions from the level reached in 1990 would still be an increase from Russia\u2019s emission levels today.\n\n\u201cOther countries, big countries, India, and others, we had to pay because they considered them a growing country.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nMr. Trump is likely referring to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nThe voluntary program has been in place since 2013, and was not mandated under the Paris agreement. The United States pledged $3 billion to the fund, but Mr. Trump halted contributions, with $2 billion still outstanding. Developing countries, including Mexico, Indonesia and Mongolia, also are putting money into the fund.\n\n\u201cCompanies are pouring back into this country, pouring back. Not like \u2014 when did you hear about car companies coming back into Michigan and coming to Ohio and expanding? You never heard that.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThe Reshoring Initiative is an advocacy group that works with manufacturing companies to return jobs to the United States from overseas. Its website lists dozens of instances when car companies returned manufacturing jobs to the United States over the past decade. For example, Ford announced it would move production of pickup trucks from Mexico to Ohio in 2015, and General Motors said it would build a type of Cadillac in Tennessee instead of Mexico in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe declined to certify the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible deal. Whoever heard you give $150 billion to a nation that has no respect for you whatsoever?\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal released about $100 billion \u2014 not $150 billion \u2014 in previously frozen Iran assets; the United States did not cut Iran a check. Much of that money is also tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.\n\n\u201cYou saw Apple just brought $350 billion in.\u201d\n\nNot quite.\n\nMr. Trump has previously claimed that Apple\u2019s $350 investment is the direct result of his tax cuts. But Apple, according to reporting in The Times, \u201cwas already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not giving us their best people, folks. They\u2019re not giving us \u2014 use your heads. They\u2019re giving us \u2014 it is a lottery.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to the diversity visa lottery. But foreign governments do not select entrants; rather, millions of individuals enter of their own volition. A computer chooses winners at random and, before receiving a visa, those selected must undergo a screening process that bars criminals and the indigent. In fact, those who have been admitted through the program have higher rates of employment and of finding work in professional or managerial occupations than most other immigrants.\n\n\u201cThis guy came in through chain migration. And a part of the lottery system. They say 22 people came in with him.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nIt is implausible that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the October 2017 truck attack in Manhattan, enabled 22 to immigrate to the United States. He is a green card holder who immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States. Under current law, he is not eligible to sponsor any extended family to immigrate to the United States.\n\n\u201cJobs are at a record level. Jobs are so good. 2.7 million jobs created since the election.\u201d\n\nTrue.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s figure is accurate, but about 600,000 of those jobs were added in the last four months of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. About 2.1 million jobs have been added since February 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office.\n\n\u201cAfrican-American unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history.\u201d\n\nIt did. But then it climbed back up.\n\nThis talking point needs an update. The unemployment rate for black Americans was 6.8 percent in December, the lowest since 1972, but it rose to 7.7 percent in January. It is worth noting that the rate has been in decline for several years and the gap between unemployment rates for white and black Americans remains high.\n\n\u201cWages are rising for the first time in many, many years.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nWages have been rising for several years. In fact, wage growth in January 2018 was slower than what it was during the last few months of Mr. Obama\u2019s term, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cLast year, we had almost a $500 billion trade deficit with China ... we have $100 billion deficit with Mexico.\u201d\n\nOverstated.\n\nIn 2016, the United States had a net trade deficit of $309 billion with China, and $63 billion with Mexico.\n\nThere is not yet fully available public trade data for 2017. The United States had trade deficits of $375 billion with China and $71 billion with Mexico in goods alone. But the United States usually maintains a surplus in the trade of services with China and Mexico, so it\u2019s likely Mr. Trump\u2019s figures are off by billions of dollars.\n\n\u201c[MS-13] shouldn\u2019t be in our country. They were let in for years, they shouldn\u2019t be.

But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem \u2014 Chinese overproduction.\n\nYet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.\n\nAlthough China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.\n\nCanada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 \u2014 17 percent \u2014 followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.\n\n\u201cFrom a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,\u201d said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. \u201cCanada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers \u2014 as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union \u2014 stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.\n\nThe United States has been seeking South Korea\u2019s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines.\n\nIncluding countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.\n\nMany products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most \u201cmade-in-America\u201d vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.\n\nThe truck\u2019s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum works in Quebec \u2014 an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.\n\nAnother 15 percent of the value of the truck\u2019s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.\n\nThe auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.\n\nEconomists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars.\n\nThe same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.\n\nOther economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.", "keywords": ["ensnare", "china", "south", "aimed", "american", "industry", "trade", "aluminum", "united", "steel", "states", "canada", "sanctions", "trump"], "polarity": 0.07730344368275403, "subjectivity": 0.3849612073750004},

In September, that office was moved into the National Economic Council and placed under the purview of its director, Gary D. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs investor whose more conventional views on trade have contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Navarro.\n\nThe White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.\n\nWhite House trade policy has been rocked in recent weeks by the departure of Rob Porter, a former aide accused of domestic violence, who had organized regular meetings for the trade staff. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.\n\nAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt is unclear what new responsibilities Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion could bring, or whether the president could change his mind. But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.\n\nMr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nMr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.\n\nAs Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.\n\nMr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.\n\nFrom a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.\n\nIn the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.\n\nIn an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.", "keywords": ["ascendant", "peter", "white", "china", "navarros", "president", "trade", "office", "united", "mr", "house", "skeptic", "navarro"], "polarity": 0.08425676055546187, "subjectivity": 0.27828859452236077},
{"title": "\n                    Behind a Key Anti-Labor Case, a Web of Conservative Donors                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/economy/labor-court-conservatives.html", "text": "And Mr. Uihlein has donated well over $1 million over the years to groups like the Federalist Society that work to orient the judiciary in a more conservative direction. They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.\n\nThe case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.\n\nAmid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.\n\nPhoto\n\nA recent paper by Mr. Hertel-Fernandez and two colleagues may foretell what Democrats can expect if Mr. Uihlein and his fellow philanthropists succeed. It found that the Democratic share of the presidential vote dropped by an average of 3.5 percentage points after the passage of so-called right-to-work laws allowing employees to avoid paying union fees. That is larger than Democrats\u2019 margin of defeat in several states that could have reversed their last three presidential losses.\n\nAnd that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201d\n\nAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.\n\nConservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin rolled back the right of most public unions to bargain over anything other than wages and eliminated the requirement that nonmembers pay fees. The portion of unionized public-sector workers in the state plummeted from half to just over one-quarter within five years.\n\nIn seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.\n\nThe Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.\n\nIn a 2014 case brought by a group that had received more than $1 million in contributions from the Bradley Foundation, the Supreme Court ruled that home-care aides and other \u201cpartial-public employees\u201d paid through Medicaid could not be forced to pay fair-share fees if they left their unions. Unions say these fees, typically about 80 percent of standard dues, are necessary to compensate them for representing nonmembers in bargaining and grievance proceedings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring 2015 and 2016, the foundation also substantially increased its contributions, totaling well over $1 million, to groups like the Independence Institute of Colorado and the Freedom Foundation of Washington State. Those groups have used such tools as direct mail, phone calls and door knocking to persuade public-sector workers to give up union membership.\n\nRichard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.\n\nFew philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.\n\nMr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe Uihleins appear to be preoccupied with state employee pensions and the unions that negotiate them.\n\n\u201cBruce is the only one in the race who isn\u2019t beholden to public-sector unions,\u201d Mr. Uihlein said of Mr. Rauner, the year before his 2014 election as Illinois governor, in an interview with Crain\u2019s Business Chicago. The Uihleins gave more than $2.5 million to his campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.\n\nSince then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nMr. Rauner\u2019s administration has amplified the institute\u2019s message, and vice versa. In an August 2016 email to state workers, the administration highlighted a benefit of giving up union membership and urged workers to visit a website that would help them do so. The policy institute soon promoted the same website and provided similar guidance in its mailings to state workers.\n\nMr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation has supplemented these efforts by supporting a nonprofit called Think Freely Media, which uses storytelling techniques to champion free-market ideas, including right-to-work laws. The Uihlein foundation contributed more than $1.5 million to Think Freely from 2014 to 2016, the last year for which tax records are available.\n\nAt the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field. I think it was an amazing story of success.\u201d\n\nBut in other contexts, Mr. Tillman has been less conciliatory.\n\nIn a fund-raising solicitation by the policy institute in December, Mr. Tillman claimed credit for helping more than 2,600 workers leave their union, resulting in a loss of $1.2 million in union revenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Illinois to throw off the shackles of big labor and big government,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen you and I look around Illinois and see the devastation the union-dominated status quo has inflicted,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe simply have no choice.\u201d", "keywords": ["unions", "state", "donors", "key", "groups", "antilabor", "million", "mr", "2016", "case", "web", "foundation", "uihlein", "conservative", "union"], "polarity": 0.09862651815776817, "subjectivity": 0.3657816257816257},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/north-korea-olympics-peace.html", "text": "Mr. Moon may see an opportunity in the surprise offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, conveyed in person by Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, to hold their first summit meeting in Pyongyang. Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["nuclear", "peace", "south", "trump", "olympics", "united", "turn", "moon", "mr", "korea", "truce", "states", "leader", "olympic", "lasting", "koreas", "north"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

He noted that the White House had voluntarily turned over more than 20,000 pages to Mr. Mueller, including documents related to Mr. Flynn and Mr. Comey, and the campaign provided 1.4 million pages.\n\nMore than 20 White House officials, including eight members of the counsel\u2019s office, voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel or congressional investigators, as did 17 campaign employees and 11 others affiliated with the campaign, he added.\n\n\u201cI give great credit to the president for his extraordinary cooperation with the special counsel,\u201d Mr. Dowd said.\n\nStill, as the pileup at the courthouse indicates, allies of Mr. Trump acknowledged that the investigation had taken a toll.\n\n\u201cThe good news for the White House is that more than 18 months since the F.B.I. probe began, there is still no evidence of Russian collusion,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe bad news is that the special counsel has a scorched-earth prosecution aimed at crushing the president\u2019s associates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president is worried about the investigation himself,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it clearly bothers him that people are being prosecuted simply because they worked for his campaign.\u201d\n\nInside the White House, officials expressed calm resignation on Friday as Mr. Gates marched into the courthouse. But there was low-grade concern out of recognition that Mr. Gates was in a lot of meetings over a long period of time.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Mr. Gates joined the campaign with Mr. Manafort, his longtime business partner and mentor, he stayed after Mr. Manafort was fired. He rode on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plane and served as liaison to the Republican National Committee. After the election victory, he joined the transition as a right hand to Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the president\u2019s close friend who ran the inaugural operation.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Gates was allowed to plead guilty to just two relatively lower-level charges indicated to legal experts that he must have something of value for Mr. Mueller. The presumption in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle is that Mr. Gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against Mr. Manafort, who in turn could threaten Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Manafort participated in a meeting in June 2016 along with Donald Trump Jr., the candidate\u2019s son, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer on the promise of receiving incriminating information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of Russia\u2019s government.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Deripaska, a Russian oligarch allied with President Vladimir V. Putin who claimed Mr. Manafort owed him $19 million. Prosecutors are interested in learning how a Republican convention platform plank on Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine was watered down.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders said Mr. Gates\u2019s credibility as a witness may be tainted by the fact that one of the charges he pleaded guilty to was lying to the F.B.I. even as he was negotiating his plea deal. Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, has said that Mr. Manafort has no damaging information against Mr. Trump. Mr. Manafort insisted again on Friday that he was innocent and would fight the \u201cuntrue piled up charges.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s argument that none of this has anything to do with him resonates with many of his supporters, who have echoed his repeated insistence that there was no collusion with Russia. But being surrounded by people who are prosecuted has damaged other presidents even when they were not directly implicated.\n\nJimmy Carter endured significant political damage when his confidant and budget director, Bert Lance, was accused of banking irregularities. Even putting aside the Iran-contra scandal and the Monica S. Lewinsky affair, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were besieged by investigations of their aides unrelated to them. In Reagan\u2019s era, it became known as the \u201csleaze factor.\u201d Mr. Clinton\u2019s team drew the scrutiny of six independent counsels other than Kenneth W. Starr.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the current case, the targets so far have included not just a \u201ccoffee boy,\u201d as Mr. Papadopoulos was described by an adviser to Mr. Trump, but the president\u2019s top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Mr. Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Mr. Manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that he was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s chairman.\n\nMoreover, it remains unclear why he volunteered to work for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressure.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation, accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled by a former British spy hired by investigators working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nTo the extent that Mr. Mueller is exploring whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey, the president\u2019s defenders contend that under the Constitution, he has the power to dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work. They also point to testimony by Mr. Comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impeded.\n\nTherefore, they argue, the original order appointing Mr. Mueller was itself invalid and should be revoked.\n\nIn the meantime, they are left to interpret the clues from Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions just like everyone else. David B. Rivkin Jr., a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Reagan and President George Bush, said the totality of Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions still did not add up to a threat to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to unfold piecemeal an indictment of Russian entities and Russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case. It makes no logical sense,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, at least, what he\u2019s done does underscore that there\u2019s no collusion there. That leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which I think is constitutionally flawed and isn\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Wittes said Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions could be seen as building a pyramid \u2014 establishing that there was a Russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses. But the special counsel has not tipped his hand yet.\n\n\u201cThe basic contours of the puzzle is that he\u2019s constructed his actions in a way that we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s leading,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s on purpose.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "gaining", "president", "steam", "mr", "worry", "manafort", "mueller", "trumps", "special", "campaign", "house", "presidents", "trump"], "polarity": 0.07249893896952721, "subjectivity": 0.39003225532637287},

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For much of its 70-year history, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom has been a go-to firm for Wall Street, representing corporations like Pfizer and DuPont in acquisitions and becoming the first law firm in history to broker $1 trillion in mergers in a year.\n\nBut when one of its former lawyers, Alex van der Zwaan, admitted this past week that he lied to the special counsel investigating Russian election interference, his guilty plea shined a light on a profitable line of business that Skadden mostly keeps quiet: its work for unsavory foreign figures and their Washington lobbyists.\n\nMr. van der Zwaan, 33, acknowledged that he misled investigators about his communications related to the firm\u2019s work for the Russia-aligned former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, done in tandem with the former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. Both were indicted on money laundering and other charges related to their work in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort has denied wrongdoing; Mr. Gates pleaded guilty on Friday and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nThe interest of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in Skadden appears to go beyond Mr. van der Zwaan. Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has requested and received documents from Skadden related to its Ukraine work, according to two lawyers familiar with the investigation. The special counsel has investigated $4 million in secret payments that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates are accused of funneling to Skadden and other firms from accounts in Cyprus, and could get more information on Skadden from Mr. Gates, who worked closely with the firm. Lawyers at Skadden are on edge, according to people who have worked with the firm.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry threatens the delicate balance that Skadden has struck between lucrative sources of revenue. The firm has made huge profits from corporate work for image-conscious United States companies, while also representing riskier international clients, such as Russian oligarchs and companies with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin and former Soviet states.\n\nSkadden\u2019s work advising controversial foreign clients was probably prompted by the same aggressive risk-taking that fueled the firm\u2019s rise from scrappy upstart to top-grossing legal giant with a range of practice areas, said Lincoln Caplan, a research scholar at Yale Law School and the author of \u201cSkadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mentality is that Skadden wouldn\u2019t be afraid of doing something like this, if there was a chance to utilize their skills and status to take advantage of what sounds like a very lucrative business, and they saw no legal or ethical proscription against their taking on the matter,\u201d he said.\n\nSkadden\u2019s work is part of a trend in recent years of lobbyists and lawyers earning increasingly larger paydays by marketing their connections in Washington to foreign politicians, countries and companies willing to pay hefty fees to burnish their reputations in the United States and on the international stage.\n\nAmong those reaping windfalls are large international law firms like the Washington-based Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, which represents the governments of Japan, the Maldives, Nicaragua and South Korea, among others.\n\nNewer lobbying upstarts like Ballard Partners have won foreign clients by capitalizing on ties to President Trump. Founded by Brian Ballard, a lobbyist based in Tallahassee, Fla., who was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, transition and inauguration, Ballard Partners has signed contracts with government entities or political parties in Albania, the Dominican Republic, Kosovo and Turkey, all since the inauguration.\n\nThose firms, which have not been accused of impropriety, disclosed the foreign contracts to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires anyone who lobbies or does public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work and payments for it. The act is intended to prevent foreign actors from surreptitiously influencing American public policy.\n\nBut for years, many American consultants have skirted the law\u2019s requirements. Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry has focused on such undisclosed lobbying among some of its leading practitioners, including Mr. Manafort, who helped pioneer the model for international consulting three decades ago. The investigation has left other firms rushing to ensure their own compliance.\n\n\u201cThis is creating concern in the Washington lobbying community about not only complying with FARA, but also a new emphasis on enforcement that perhaps folks didn\u2019t think was happening or would happen,\u201d said Thomas J. Spulak, a lawyer in the Washington office of King & Spalding who specializes in lobbying compliance.\n\nMr. Mueller has scrutinized Skadden on two fronts \u2014 its own work for Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, and its role advising to two other powerhouse Washington lobbying firms paid to bolster his government, Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group.\n\nMr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates of orchestrating a complicated scheme through which Mercury and Podesta were paid about $1 million each through a nonprofit front group to advocate on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Mr. Gates admitted that he knowingly misled Skadden \u2014 though the firm is not named in court filings \u2014 in a scheme to avoid FARA registration by indicating incorrectly that the nonprofit was not supervised or controlled by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government. Relying on that information, Skadden prepared a legal opinion in 2012 that the lobbying firms used in opting not to register under FARA.\n\nSkadden\u2019s opinion, which was written by a partner, Kenneth A. Gross, and an associate, and was reviewed by The New York Times, asserted that the firms were not required to register because their client, the Brussels-based European Center for a Modern Ukraine, \u201cis a private nongovernmental organization\u201d not controlled or funded by a foreign government or political party.\n\nImage Alex van der Zwaan, a former lawyer from Skadden, admitted that he lied to the special counsel investigating Russian election interference. Credit Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nThe Justice Department, which enforces FARA, began investigating the arrangement in 2016, and Mercury and Podesta registered, belatedly, under the act last year. The special counsel has continued looking into the matter, subpoenaing the firms for testimony about their Ukraine work.\n\nDespite Mr. Gates\u2019s admission that he misled Skadden, people who worked with Podesta and Mercury privately blame the law firm for the faulty guidance.\n\nMercury, which relied on Skadden for years for FARA advice and for assistance last year in responding to subpoenas from the special counsel, is no longer working with Skadden, according to three people in the lobbying industry who were briefed on the change.\n\nLobbyists who worked with the Podesta Group, which largely collapsed under the glare of Mr. Mueller\u2019s scrutiny and attacks from the right, have grumbled that the firm erred in relying on the legal opinion that Skadden prepared for Mercury, rather than paying for its own.\n\nMercury said in a statement that it \u201cacted appropriately, following our counsel\u2019s advice from the start.\u201d The firm said that Mr. Gates, in pleading guilty, admitted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the truth to our lawyers when he spoke to them about this project.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Podesta as well as Mr. Gross declined to comment.\n\nSkadden has been cooperating with prosecutors, a spokeswoman, Melissa Porter, said in a statement. Lawrence S. Spiegel, a partner who specializes in government enforcement and white-collar crime, has been assigned to handle interactions with the special counsel, and Ms. Porter noted that the firm dismissed Mr. van der Zwaan and said that the lying charges he pleaded guilty to are \u201ccontrary to our values, policies and expectations.\u201d\n\nBut Skadden may not be able to limit its legal exposure by distancing itself from Mr. van der Zwaan if the special counsel can implicate the firm in wrongdoing in the work or payments on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics.\n\n\u201cWhy he was lying is a big question, and did anyone else at the law firm know he was lying?\u201d Ms. Roiphe said. \u201cIf he was lying for his own purposes, I don\u2019t think that knowledge would be imputed to other lawyers at the firm.\u201d\n\nThe answers to those questions are not entirely clear.\n\nMr. van der Zwaan admitted misleading prosecutors about two conversations in September 2016 with Mr. Gates and an unidentified business associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort. They discussed their belief that Skadden\u2019s work for Mr. Yanukovych exposed the firm to possible criminal charges in Ukraine. No such charges have been filed.\n\nAfter the conversation with the business associate, prosecutors said, Mr. van der Zwaan called the senior Skadden lawyer on the Ukrainian project, Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Court filings do not reveal what was discussed, and Mr. Craig was not identified by name by prosecutors.\n\nSkadden worked for the Ukrainian government on a 2012 report analyzing the prosecution of one of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s leading political rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates used an offshore account to \u201cfunnel $4 million to pay for the report,\u201d according to court papers, which note that the financial arrangement \u201cwas not disclosed.\u201d It is not clear how much of the $4 million went to Skadden.\n\nAdding a layer of intrigue, a consultant who worked on the report said that it was facilitated in part by Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a former Russian Army linguist and longtime associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort who is \u201cassessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Kilimnik did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe study was used by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s allies to rebut international criticism that the prosecution and jailing of Ms. Tymoshenko was politically motivated and lacked sufficient evidence. But it was widely dismissed as a flawed attempt to paper over concerns about Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s abuses, and other lobbyists promoting Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government said they declined to promote the report for lack of credibility.\n\nSkadden did not respond to questions about the financing of its Ukraine work, but it said in a statement that the report was independent and noted that it found that Ms. Tymoshenko \u201cwas denied basic rights under Western legal standards.\u201d\n\nThe Washington lobbyists who worked on the issue with Mercury and Podesta said that Mr. Craig himself was involved in promoting the report to journalists and members of Congress \u2014 activity that experts said should have prompted FARA registration requirements.\n\nSkadden internally reviewed the FARA implications of its Ukraine work before deciding not to register, according to the consultant who worked with the firm on the report.\n\nMs. Porter, the Skadden spokeswoman, said that neither Mr. Craig nor any of the firm\u2019s other lawyers \u201cengaged in any activity that required them or the firm to register under FARA.\u201d Mr. Craig did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLess than a year and a half after the release of the Skadden report, Mr. Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia amid street protests over his government\u2019s corruption and its pivot toward Moscow. Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government collapsed and Ms. Tymoshenko was freed.\n\nAnd last year, as the Justice Department was inquiring about the Ukrainian work, Skadden returned about half of the reported $1.1 million it was paid by the Ukrainian government.\n\nKenneth P.

But in 2012, he said, he had been invited by Mr. Schultz to go to Ukraine with Mr. Kwasniewski, the first of some 25 trips, all done \u201cpro bono,\u201d Mr. Cox said, to try to get the detainees released.\n\n\u201cThe view in Western capitals was that these were the victims of selective justice,\u201d Mr. Cox said.

By contrast, a consumer paying cash might have to pay $8 to $15.\n\nMark Merritt, the president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers, said he agreed that consumers should pay the lower amount.\n\nAs for the use of gag clauses, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not condoned by the industry. We don\u2019t defend it. It has occurred on rare occasions, but it\u2019s an outlier practice that we oppose.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, Thomas E. Menighan, the chief executive of the American Pharmacists Association, said that such clauses were \u201cnot an outlier,\u201d but instead a relatively common practice. Under many contracts, he said, \u201cthe pharmacist cannot volunteer the fact that a medicine is less expensive if you pay the cash price and we don\u2019t run it through your health plan.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was introduced by the top Democrat in the Connecticut Senate, Martin M. Looney, and the top Republican, Len Fasano.\n\n\u201cThis is information that consumers should have,\u201d Mr. Looney said in an interview, \u201cbut that they were denied under the somewhat arbitrary and capricious contracts that pharmacists were required to abide by.\u201d\n\nMr. Fasano said that consumers were sometimes paying three or four times as much when they used their insurance as they would have paid without it. \u201cThat\u2019s price gouging,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe legislation, Mr. Fasano said, encountered \u201ca lot of resistance\u201d from large pharmacy benefit managers and some insurance companies.\n\nIn North Carolina, a new law says that pharmacists \u201cshall have the right\u201d to provide insured customers with information about their insurance co-payments and less costly alternatives.\n\nA new Georgia law says that a pharmacist may not be penalized for disclosing such information to a customer. Maine has adopted a similar law.\n\nIn North Dakota, a new law explicitly bans gag orders. It says that a pharmacy or pharmacist may provide information that \u201cmay include the cost and clinical efficacy of a more affordable alternative drug if one is available.\u201d\n\nThe North Dakota law also says that a pharmacy benefit manager or insurer may not charge a co-payment that exceeds the actual cost of a medication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lobby for drug benefit companies, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, has filed suit in federal court to block the North Dakota law, saying it imposes \u201conerous new restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, it says, the North Dakota law could require the disclosure of \u201cproprietary trade secrets,\u201d including information about how drug prices are set. \u201cP.B.M.\u2013pharmacy contracts typically preclude a pharmacy from disclosing to the patient the amount of a reimbursement,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nGov.

Lawmakers who earn an \u201cA\u201d rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office.\n\nFor candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections.\n\nThe organization\u2019s calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants a simplistic answer, which is they buy votes,\u201d said Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College and the author of \u201cGuns, Gun Control, and Elections.\u201d \u201cBut it is largely incorrect. The N.R.A.\u2019s power is more complex than people think.\u201d\n\nCompared with the towering sums of money donated to House and Senate candidates in the last cycle \u2014 $1.7 billion \u2014 the N.R.A.\u2019s direct contributions were almost a rounding error.\n\nThe N.R.A. directly donated a total of just $1.1 million to candidates for federal office in 2016, with 99 percent of that money going to Republicans, while giving a total of only $309,000 in direct contributions to state legislative candidates in 2016 and 2017, according to tallies by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks state-level donations.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose amounts are dwarfed by the largess of other major contributors. Comcast, through its political action committee and its employees, directly donated $12.7 million in the 2016 campaign cycle to federal candidates or political parties, and the committee for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, and its employees directly donated nearly $3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics tallies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.\u2019s spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members.\n\nWhen candidates waver in their support for sweeping gun rights, the group does not hesitate to turn on them. After Ted Strickland, a Democrat who earned the N.R.A.\u2019s endorsement as a candidate for governor of Ohio, backed a ban on assault weapons, the organization spent more than $1.5 million in so-called independent expenditures, like TV ads, to defeat him in a 2016 bid for the Senate.\n\nMs. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the group\u2019s board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s leadership. \u201cAt times like this, it\u2019s very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.\u201d\n\nWhile the N.R.A. cuts relatively few checks to individual lawmakers \u2014 a fact that has been noted by The Tampa Bay Times, among others \u2014 it does devote tens of millions of dollars to ads backing its preferred candidates or criticizing its opponents, often with vividly alarmist messages about crime and self-defense.\n\nThe N.R.A., through its various legal entities, raises money for its political and lobbying efforts and other activities from two primary sources: member dues and contributions from outside supporters, including gun makers like Smith & Wesson and political groups like Freedom Partners, the Koch family-backed organization.\n\nThe group has fought to keep the identity of many of its biggest contributors secret, although an audit document filed with the State of North Carolina showed that its total budget was about $420 million in 2016.\n\nThe N.R.A. spent $20 million in that year\u2019s election cycle on ads and other campaign tactics intended to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and an additional $11 million to support Donald J. Trump \u2014 money that is not marked down as a direct contribution to Mr. Trump, because the N.R.A. spent the cash on its own.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The N.R.A.\u2019s presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast fall in Virginia, where the N.R.A. is headquartered and once held commanding clout over the state government, Democrats swept all of the state\u2019s major offices after campaigning loudly against the organization. The state\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat whom the N.R.A. had targeted for defeat, said the group had insisted on defending a platform that was \u201cbecoming more and more untenable\u201d with voters in the political middle.\n\n\u201cThere were parts of the state where they wouldn\u2019t run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,\u201d Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.\u2019s campaign spending: \u201cIt did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.\u201d\n\nStill, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A.\n\nIn Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate.\n\nThe former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have \u201crun like scalded rats from the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey turn out people that already agree with them,\u201d Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. \u201cThe reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\nBut it has had major losses, too, including in the Senate special election in Alabama late last year, in which it spent money to try to defeat Doug Jones, a Democrat who challenged Roy S. Moore.\n\nOver all, the success rate of the N.R.A. ebbs and flows with political trends. With Mr. Trump on the ballot, candidates it supported directly at the federal level in 2016 won 73 percent of the time, while its preferred candidates won only 44 percent of the time in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president.\n\nIn almost all forms of spending \u2014 direct campaign contributions, independent expenditures and lobbying \u2014 gun rights groups have far outspent gun control groups in recent decades, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, spending that advocates gun control has picked up in recent years, fueled by groups backed by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in a 2011 shooting, and by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.\n\nThere have been hints in recent days, with the protests after the Parkland shooting and a string of businesses cutting ties with the N.R.A. \u2014 as well as a fiery and defensive speech delivered by its leader at a conservative conference \u2014 that the group is losing ground. Even some of its key political supporters, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, and top lawmakers in the state, have proposed measures like raising the age limit for gun purchases to 21.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Mr. Bloomberg, said he saw signs that the N.R.A.\u2019s influence was in decline, despite a surge in 2017 in federal lobbying spending by the organization. He pointed to its inability last year to get legislation through the Republican Congress that would give legal gun owners the right to carry concealed weapons outside their home states.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said. \u201cThe truth is, they are making bad bets. And they are out of sync.

Image President Trump speaking on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. The sanctions are intended to close a loophole in the effort to cut off North Korea\u2019s imports of oil and exports of coal. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump addressed a range of policy issues, from tax cuts to gun policy to immigration, at Friday\u2019s annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Below is a look at some of the facts and figures he cited that were accurate, false or could use some additional context.\n\n\u201cWe have passed massive, biggest in history, tax cuts and reforms \u2026 for 45 years nothing has been passed.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThe $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law in December are not the largest in history. According a previous analysis in The New York Times, they amount to the 12th largest, as a share of the economy.\n\nAlso, Mr. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to enact tax cuts. Tax legislation was signed into law by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Further, the cuts passed under Mr. Reagan and Mr. Obama were larger, as a share of the economy, than those recently signed by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cNo president has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term as we have cut in less than a year.\u201d\n\nEvidence is lacking.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to label actions taken by federal agencies as deregulatory and regulatory, so it\u2019s a difficult comparison to make. Previous administrations have counted the number of regulations withdrawn from the federal registry. By that metric, Mr. Trump did not eliminate more in one year than his predecessors in their entire terms.\n\n\u201cWe have massive energy reserves, we have coal, we have so much. And basically they say you can\u2019t use it.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to the Paris climate accord that his administration announced the United States was withdrawing from in June 2017.\n\nEmissions reductions under the agreement are voluntary. So, contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, coal consumption in the United States would not have necessarily been affected.\n\n\u201cChina, their agreement didn\u2019t kick in until 2030. Right. Our agreement kicks in immediately. Russia, they\u2019re allowed to go back into the 1990s, which was not a clean environmental time.\u201d\n\nThis needs context.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the United States offered to cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels, by 2025, as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nChina ratified the Paris agreement in September 2016. The country pledged to lower emissions after an projected peak level of emissions in 2030. But updated projections anticipate that peak will occur closer to 2020 as the Chinese government invests in renewable energy and halts production on cars that don\u2019t meet fuel efficiency standards.\n\nRussia pledged to cut emissions by 25 to 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. That is rated \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d by the Climate Action Tracker, which scores countries\u2019 pledges. Russia\u2019s economy had collapsed, causing emissions to drop rapidly, with the fall of the Soviet Union. So reducing emissions from the level reached in 1990 would still be an increase from Russia\u2019s emission levels today.\n\n\u201cOther countries, big countries, India, and others, we had to pay because they considered them a growing country.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nMr. Trump is likely referring to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nThe voluntary program has been in place since 2013, and was not mandated under the Paris agreement. The United States pledged $3 billion to the fund, but Mr. Trump halted contributions, with $2 billion still outstanding. Developing countries, including Mexico, Indonesia and Mongolia, also are putting money into the fund.\n\n\u201cCompanies are pouring back into this country, pouring back. Not like \u2014 when did you hear about car companies coming back into Michigan and coming to Ohio and expanding? You never heard that.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThe Reshoring Initiative is an advocacy group that works with manufacturing companies to return jobs to the United States from overseas. Its website lists dozens of instances when car companies returned manufacturing jobs to the United States over the past decade. For example, Ford announced it would move production of pickup trucks from Mexico to Ohio in 2015, and General Motors said it would build a type of Cadillac in Tennessee instead of Mexico in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe declined to certify the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible deal. Whoever heard you give $150 billion to a nation that has no respect for you whatsoever?\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal released about $100 billion \u2014 not $150 billion \u2014 in previously frozen Iran assets; the United States did not cut Iran a check. Much of that money is also tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.\n\n\u201cYou saw Apple just brought $350 billion in.\u201d\n\nNot quite.\n\nMr. Trump has previously claimed that Apple\u2019s $350 investment is the direct result of his tax cuts. But Apple, according to reporting in The Times, \u201cwas already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not giving us their best people, folks. They\u2019re not giving us \u2014 use your heads. They\u2019re giving us \u2014 it is a lottery.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to the diversity visa lottery. But foreign governments do not select entrants; rather, millions of individuals enter of their own volition. A computer chooses winners at random and, before receiving a visa, those selected must undergo a screening process that bars criminals and the indigent. In fact, those who have been admitted through the program have higher rates of employment and of finding work in professional or managerial occupations than most other immigrants.\n\n\u201cThis guy came in through chain migration. And a part of the lottery system. They say 22 people came in with him.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nIt is implausible that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the October 2017 truck attack in Manhattan, enabled 22 to immigrate to the United States. He is a green card holder who immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States. Under current law, he is not eligible to sponsor any extended family to immigrate to the United States.\n\n\u201cJobs are at a record level. Jobs are so good. 2.7 million jobs created since the election.\u201d\n\nTrue.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s figure is accurate, but about 600,000 of those jobs were added in the last four months of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. About 2.1 million jobs have been added since February 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office.\n\n\u201cAfrican-American unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history.\u201d\n\nIt did. But then it climbed back up.\n\nThis talking point needs an update. The unemployment rate for black Americans was 6.8 percent in December, the lowest since 1972, but it rose to 7.7 percent in January. It is worth noting that the rate has been in decline for several years and the gap between unemployment rates for white and black Americans remains high.\n\n\u201cWages are rising for the first time in many, many years.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nWages have been rising for several years. In fact, wage growth in January 2018 was slower than what it was during the last few months of Mr. Obama\u2019s term, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cLast year, we had almost a $500 billion trade deficit with China ... we have $100 billion deficit with Mexico.\u201d\n\nOverstated.\n\nIn 2016, the United States had a net trade deficit of $309 billion with China, and $63 billion with Mexico.\n\nThere is not yet fully available public trade data for 2017. The United States had trade deficits of $375 billion with China and $71 billion with Mexico in goods alone. But the United States usually maintains a surplus in the trade of services with China and Mexico, so it\u2019s likely Mr. Trump\u2019s figures are off by billions of dollars.\n\n\u201c[MS-13] shouldn\u2019t be in our country. They were let in for years, they shouldn\u2019t be. And we\u2019re getting them out.\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThe gang known as MS-13 was formed in Los Angeles by refugees from El Salvador in the 1980s. The government began deporting its members in the mid-1990s, which helped the gang\u2019s leadership grow abroad.\n\nLisa Friedman contributed reporting.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

Does it bother you, that designation?\n\nWe were making fun of my persona. I\u2019m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

He points out that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is \u201cboth a black film and the newest entrant in the most bankable movie franchise in history,\u201d and he rightly predicts that, \u201cFor a wary and risk-averse film business, led largely by white film executives who have been historically predisposed to greenlight projects featuring characters who look like them, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 will offer proof that a depiction of a reality of something other than whiteness can make a ton of money.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d and the Invention of \u201cAfrica\u201d\u2019 [The New Yorker]\n\n\u201cAfrica \u2014 or, rather, \u2018Africa\u2019 \u2014 is a creation of a white world and the literary, academic, cinematic and political mechanisms that it used to give mythology the credibility of truth,\u201d Jelani Cobb observes in an essay on how the film addresses the West\u2019s long history of exploiting Africans. \u201cNo such nation as Wakanda exists on the map of the continent, but that is entirely beside the point. Wakanda is no more or less imaginary than the Africa conjured by Hume or Trevor-Roper, or the one canonized in such Hollywood offerings as \u2018Tarzan.\u2019 It is a redemptive counter-mythology.\u201d\n\nThe Women of Wakanda\n\n\u2018Finally, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is a Movie Black Women Can Celebrate\u2019 [Independent]\n\nThe film is earning heaps of praise for its female characters. The journalist and activist Adebola Lamuye writes: \u201cFor those of us who have struggled to find multifaceted representations of ourselves, this is it. The dark-skinned female superhero finally looks like me, my sister, my mother, my friends.

The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

I love you guys.\u201d\n\nSeemingly channeling Earnhardt, who went by the nickname The Intimidator, Dillon bumped the leader Aric Almirola on the last lap, pushing him into the wall before zooming past.

As he took the interview podium in the media workroom, his mother, Desiree Wallace, ran up and hugged her son as both melted into tears.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["effect", "sign", "white", "nonwhite", "united", "immigrants", "color", "wants", "america", "states", "trump", "immigration", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zumas", "white", "africa", "whats", "south", "economic", "jacob", "mr", "black", "corruption", "distinctive", "zuma", "mess", "apartheid"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["simpsons", "evoking", "woman", "work", "art", "began", "simpson", "black", "cant", "seen", "race", "world", "images"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion.

I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

{"title": "\n                    Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics, and Fact and Fiction                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/design/obama-portrait.html", "text": "There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLansdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["sherald", "paint", "politics", "blend", "portrait", "ms", "obama", "fiction", "fact", "mr", "black", "wiley", "portraits", "washington", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

It was also on display in the campaign of Kim Guadagno, a Republican who lost the race to replace Chris Christie as governor of New Jersey.\n\nIn their quest to retake the House or the Senate (or both), Democrats should not shy away from incorporating and welcoming immigrants into their own rhetoric. When Republicans embark on meanspirited immigrant bashing, Democrats should take notes from Harry Reid\u2019s 2010 re-election victory in Nevada and Ralph Northam\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial win in Virginia. Both Mr. Reid and Mr. Northam rebuffed racially charged anti-immigrant campaigns, standing up for Dreamers, and in the process winning over Latino voters alongside a coalition of progressive and moderate college-educated whites.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. Reid made a strong stand for the Dream Act while competing against a Republican, Sharron Angle, who ran a nativist campaign equating immigrants with gang members. Mr. Reid defied the polls and won re-election on the strength of very high Latino turnout \u2014 and no signs of a white working-class backlash.\n\nAccording to the exit polls, Mr. Reid ran 11 percentage points ahead of Ms. Angle among white voters who earn less than $50,000 and, according to data compiled by Latino Decisions, a polling organization that I co-founded, won an estimated 90 percent of the Latino vote.\n\nIn 2016, Nevada proved to be one of the bright spots for Democrats. Mr. Reid\u2019s strategy was embraced by his successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina elected to the Senate.\n\nIn the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, there has been a renewed focus on the so-called white working-class vote, a demographic segment that has been getting smaller each year and has been trending away from Democrats for a long time. While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.\n\nMatt A.

The cartoon was published after Mr. Trump contended in his State of the Union speech that undocumented immigrants \u201chave caused the loss of innocent lives,\u201d and focused specifically on MS-13, a gang formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees fleeing El Salvador\u2019s civil war.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Meanwhile, members of Congress have been unable to forge protections for the so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the United States illegally as children. In September, Mr. Trump suspended an Obama-era initiative to protect them from deportation.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s entire congressional delegation, including Representative Steve Pearce, a conservative Republican, and Senators Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall, both Democrats, issued a joint statement calling the cartoon \u201cracist and divisive.\u201d\n\nResponding to a request for comment, Ms. Moses referred to her apology, which was included in a statement published on The Journal\u2019s website. In that statement, she said journalists in her newsroom did not have a role in deciding which cartoons to publish, a decision left to the editorial board.\n\n\u201cThere obviously will be another story tomorrow, as we treat this controversy as we would with any newsworthy controversy,\u201d Ms. Moses added in an email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Delonas is no stranger to controversy. In 2009, the media magnate Rupert Murdoch issued a personal apology over a cartoon by Mr. Delonas of a chimpanzee that was interpreted by some as a racist attack on President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Delonas said he did not know if any other newspapers aside from The Journal had published his latest cartoon.\n\nDaryl Cagle, the publisher of Cagle Cartoons, which syndicates Mr. Delonas\u2019s work, said that more than half of daily, paid-circulation newspapers in the United States subscribe to the company\u2019s service, but that he did not know how many other newspapers had published the cartoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that this cartoon sparks outrage,\u201d Mr. Cagle said by email. \u201cIt is up to each newspaper editor to decide what is appropriate to run in their own newspaper. My personal view is that I agree with the critics of Sean\u2019s cartoon.\u201d\n\nIn addition to criticism from subscribers, political leaders and immigration advocates, The Journal faced outrage on Thursday from some members of its own staff.\n\nRoberto Rosales, a photographer for the newspaper who is from El Salvador, said on Twitter that he condemns MS-13.

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents.

He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one\u2019s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["effect", "sign", "white", "nonwhite", "united", "immigrants", "color", "wants", "america", "states", "trump", "immigration", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["zumas", "white", "africa", "whats", "south", "economic", "jacob", "mr", "black", "corruption", "distinctive", "zuma", "mess", "apartheid"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["simpsons", "evoking", "woman", "work", "art", "began", "simpson", "black", "cant", "seen", "race", "world", "images"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion.

I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the ticketing site Fandango, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d set a record among Marvel films for the most advance tickets sold in a 24-hour period. It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201d", "keywords": ["mask", "kid", "white", "york", "panther", "meanings", "black", "panthers", "history", "think", "dress", "race", "characters"], "polarity": 0.05700972543438296, "subjectivity": 0.3779504437723616},

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["sherald", "paint", "politics", "blend", "portrait", "ms", "obama", "fiction", "fact", "mr", "black", "wiley", "portraits", "washington", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

{"title": "\n                    Democrats Can Win on Immigration                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/opinion/democrats-win-immigration.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nOp-Ed Contributor Democrats Can Win on Immigration Image Credit John Moore/Getty Images\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 To no one\u2019s surprise, President Trump, who has been doubling down on his anti-immigrant rhetoric, used his State of the Union address to draw parallels between the Central American gang MS-13 and law-abiding immigrants in the United States.\n\nThe next week, he reiterated that \u201cMS-13 killers\u201d are \u201cpouring into our country.\u201d This kind of language, long a Trump trademark, was used as a political strategy just a few months ago in Virginia during the failed bid of the Republican candidate for governor, Ed Gillespie. It was also on display in the campaign of Kim Guadagno, a Republican who lost the race to replace Chris Christie as governor of New Jersey.\n\nIn their quest to retake the House or the Senate (or both), Democrats should not shy away from incorporating and welcoming immigrants into their own rhetoric. When Republicans embark on meanspirited immigrant bashing, Democrats should take notes from Harry Reid\u2019s 2010 re-election victory in Nevada and Ralph Northam\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial win in Virginia. Both Mr. Reid and Mr. Northam rebuffed racially charged anti-immigrant campaigns, standing up for Dreamers, and in the process winning over Latino voters alongside a coalition of progressive and moderate college-educated whites.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. Reid made a strong stand for the Dream Act while competing against a Republican, Sharron Angle, who ran a nativist campaign equating immigrants with gang members. Mr. Reid defied the polls and won re-election on the strength of very high Latino turnout \u2014 and no signs of a white working-class backlash.\n\nAccording to the exit polls, Mr. Reid ran 11 percentage points ahead of Ms. Angle among white voters who earn less than $50,000 and, according to data compiled by Latino Decisions, a polling organization that I co-founded, won an estimated 90 percent of the Latino vote.\n\nIn 2016, Nevada proved to be one of the bright spots for Democrats. Mr. Reid\u2019s strategy was embraced by his successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina elected to the Senate.\n\nIn the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, there has been a renewed focus on the so-called white working-class vote, a demographic segment that has been getting smaller each year and has been trending away from Democrats for a long time. While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.\n\nMatt A.
