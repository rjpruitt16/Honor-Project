Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has been uncharacteristically mum this week when asked to comment on reports that he may change his mind about retiring this year.\n\n\"I don't really have anything to say,\" Corker told NPR Monday evening. But on Tuesday evening a spokeswoman suggested Corker could be rethinking his decision to retire.\n\n\"In recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\" Micah Johnson, a Corker spokeswoman, said in a statement provided to NPR. \"The senator has been encouraged to reconsider his decision and is listening closely.\"\n\nReports surfaced over the weekend, first by CNN, that some forces within the GOP were prodding Corker to reconsider over concerns that an open-seat race could deliver an upset Democratic victory in this year's midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats are rallying behind former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a rare breed of Democrat who has the potential to put a Southern red state in play.\n\nThe GOP Senate primary includes half a dozen candidates, but Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., a media-savvy, Tea Party-styled conservative, is leading the pack so far.\n\nWhile Blackburn's politics play well in a GOP primary, there appears to be some intraparty concern that she could lose a general election. Blackburn's campaign pushed back hard against that narrative, accusing forces within the GOP of blatant sexism.\n\n\"Ego-driven, tired old men\"\n\n\"Anyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can't win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\" said Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for Blackburn's campaign. \"She's the best fundraiser in the country and is beating Phil Bredesen in several polls. We aren't worried about these ego-driven, tired old men. Marsha has spent her whole life fighting people who told her she wasn't good enough, and she will do it again.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to say whether he would like Corker to reverse course and run for re-election.\n\n\"You're going to have to ask Sen. Corker about what his plans are,\" McConnell told reporters. McConnell's sidestep is in stark contrast to the public pressure campaign he used to encourage Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to reverse course and run in 2016.\n\n\"Sen. Corker, so far as I know, is not running,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., added Tuesday. \"I was very disappointed when Sen. Corker decided not to run, but it's a very personal decision. I didn't try to tell him what to do, and I won't try and tell him what to do now.\"\n\nAlexander praised Blackburn, noting he has supported her in her past congressional races. \"I think she is an excellent member of Congress,\" he said, downplaying concerns of her perceived weakness in a general election fight. \"I think she would be a very good candidate.\"\n\nTrump critic\n\nTennessee Republicans who are close to Corker say there's been plenty of talk over the past few days about the senator's possible re-entry into the race.\n\nTom Ingram, a longtime Tennessee GOP consultant who has worked for Corker on past campaigns, said that many people were disappointed and surprised when Corker announced his retirement last fall, but he noted that decision was made when the senator and President Trump were feuding.\n\nWhile Corker was an early ally of Trump's, he slowly became one of the harshest and most outspoken critics of the Trump administration in 2017, attacking the president's leadership, character \u2014 and moral fitness for office.\n\nThat relationship has been on the mend recently and Ingram says he is not surprised Corker may be second-guessing that snap decision.\n\n\"I think what happened was he made a decision at a moment in time around the dust-up not to run, and then he went back to work and started getting back into the groove of what he does every day, and realized how important it is and how much he's going to miss it and the contribution he can make. And then this groundswell starts and I think it really got his attention,\" Ingram said. \"It's a buzz right now around Washington and down here, and I think he's listening to it.\"\n\nOne reason for that buzz is concern about whether Blackburn would face a competitive race against Bredesen if she were the GOP nominee compared with Corker's general election prospects.\n\n\"Marsha's more polarizing, so Bredesen against Blackburn puts the race in play,\" said Ingram.\n\nA potential unretirement is unusual, but not unprecedented. Rubio, for example, reversed his retirement decision in 2016, after losing the GOP presidential primary, in the face of pressure to reconsider from GOP leaders including McConnell. His reversal protected a vulnerable GOP-held seat and helped Republicans hold their Senate majority.\n\nCorker now faces similar pressures. Senate Republicans are decidedly on offense in 2018 \u2014 defending just eight seats against Democrats' 28 seats. But with a slim 51-49 majority, nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nDemocrats eye Tennessee\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two seats \u2014 and suffer no losses \u2014 to win a majority in the Senate. Their best prospects for doing so are in Nevada and Arizona, but those are not guarantees. The open seat in Tennessee is the only realistic option for a third target at this time. It's a long shot, but also a long shot that is clearly making some Republicans nervous.\n\nDemocrats are also defending four toss-up seats in Indiana, Missouri, West Virginia and Minnesota, according to the Cook Political Report. And Republicans are also targeting competitive seats held by Democrats in Florida and North Dakota, as well as possibly Maine, Ohio, Montana and possibly elsewhere.\n\nSo as many targets as Democrats can put on the map, the better their chances.\n\nCorker has some time to make up his mind \u2014 Tennessee's filing deadline for candidates is April 5. His toughest challenge in re-entering the race may be the amount of crow he would have to eat to win a GOP primary in a state where President Trump remains popular and where primary opponents like Blackburn remain steadfastly loyal behind Trump.\n\nIf Corker gets back into the race, he'll have to emphasize how much he has repaired his relationship with Trump, said Mark Braden, a Republican strategist who managed Corker's last re-election campaign.\n\n\"I think they've made amends,\" Braden said. \"If Sen. Corker runs, he would certainly have to highlight ways to show Tennesseans he and the president are on good terms and can work together.\"\n\nCorker will also have to explain to voters why he wants to stay in the Senate after all. In September, Corker had made it quite clear he was tired of being a senator.\n\nBut then again, so did Rubio.", "keywords": ["retiring", "reconsider", "corker", "closely", "listening", "think", "senate", "seats", "race", "sen", "decision", "gop", "republicans", "blackburn", "encouraged"], "polarity": 0.09903943708067417, "subjectivity": 0.463383243331697},

Mike Rogers, as well as the heads of the Defense Intelligence Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley and Robert Cardillo, respectively.\n\nThe intelligence bosses were asked to restate their support for the 2017 report that concluded Russia had waged a campaign of what spies call \"active measures\" against the 2016 election. All of them did.\n\nPresident Trump goes back and forth about whether he accepts there was such an attack or whether it was a \"hoax\" waged by sore-loser Democrats.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he was frustrated at trying to warn his constituents about the threat from foreign interference when voters were able to point to Trump's comments and question whether it was actually happening.\n\nBut lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as the intelligence officials, spoke to the importance of at least speaking clearly about the Russian threat, even as the issue of whether the president's campaign colluded with the Russians remains an open question under investigation by DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to be happening, and the resilience needed for us to stand up and say we're not going to allow some Russian to tell us how to vote, how we ought to run our country,\" Coats said, in response to questions from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. \"I think there needs to be a national cry for that.\"\n\nMembers of the Senate committee differed on how well they thought the United States is preparing for continued influence operations against the democratic process.\n\nVice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said he was frustrated by what he called a lack of action and a lack of coordination inside the intelligence agencies.\n\n\"We've had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter further attacks,\" Warner said. \"But I believe we still don't have a comprehensive plan.\"\n\nSen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, on the other hand, said extensive discussions in Congress and in the press since 2016 meant that Americans now know better what to expect.\n\n\"I think the American people are ready for this,\" Risch said. \"I think they're going to look askance a lot more at the information attempting to be passed out through social media.\"\n\nFacebook and Twitter and other online platforms have become key conduits for disinformation that originates in Russia and attempts to amplify political division between Americans.\n\n\"It's been ridiculous\"\n\nPompeo used part of the hearing to try to correct the record. He faulted stories in the New York Times and The Intercept last week that said American intelligence officials paid $100,000 to a \"shadowy Russian\" in an effort to get back stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons.\n\nNot only did American spies want to recover stolen secrets but they also were offered material described as compromising about Trump, according to the stories.\n\nThat didn't happen, the CIA director said.\n\n\"Reporting on this matter has been atrocious, it's been ridiculous, it's been totally inaccurate,\" Pompeo said, adding that the CIA did not \"provide any resources, no money\" for what he called \"phony information.\"\n\nThere was no information as to whether another intelligence agency or government department might have paid to try to recover the NSA material.\n\nThe Senate committee also discussed the nuclear missile threat from North Korea and the \"instability,\" as Coats described it, of that country's leader, Kim Jong Un.\n\nNorth Korea staged a massive military parade last week, showcasing its tanks and missiles, ahead of the Winter Olympics' opening ceremony in South Korea. It also has sent a contingent of athletes and cheerleaders to the Olympics, but DIA's Ashley said nothing has changed about the North's dangerous aims toward its neighbors or the United States.\n\n\"Decision time is becoming ever closer in terms of how we respond to this,\" Coats said. \"We have to face the fact that this is a potentially existential problem for the United States.\"\n\nIntellectual property theft by China, terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaida, and drugs crossing the Southern border from Mexico also came up, but the hearing kept coming back to the broad peril involved with cyberattacks.\n\n\"Cyber is clearly the most challenging threat vector this country faces,\" said Senate intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C. \"It's also the most concerning, given how many aspects of our daily lives in the United States can be disrupted by a well-planned, well-executed cyberattack.\"\n\nKing complained that the United States doesn't have a formal strategy to deter cyberattackers. Instead, \"all we do is patch our software and try to defend ourselves,\" he said.\n\n\"We are trying to fight a global battle with our hands tied behind our back,\" he added.\n\nThe Porter matter\n\nTwo FBI-related storylines also continued to pop up: One involved the timeline of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter's resignation. The other involved accusations by Trump and other Republicans that the intelligence community is biased against them.\n\nWray was asked on Tuesday by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., for a more complete order of events in terms of when the White House knew about domestic violence allegations against Porter as part of his background check process \u2014 allegations Porter has denied.\n\nThe White House has been ambiguous about when senior officials knew about the allegations of abuse by two of Porter's ex-wives, which could have affected his ability to get a full security clearance.\n\nWray said the FBI followed protocol and turned in an initial report in late July 2017. Wray declined to say what was in the report, but he said that his agency received requests for a follow-up and responded to that by November and closed the file in January 2018.\n\nThat differed from some accounts of events given by the White House.\n\nAnd, as has been the case at many hearings on Capitol Hill in the past few months, Wray also was given the chance to respond to criticism from Trump that the FBI is \"in tatters.\" More recently, the FBI has come under more criticism after the release of a Republican memo that alleged bias against Trump.\n\nWray repeated that he has \"grave concerns\" about omissions in the memo by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House intelligence committee, which both the FBI and the Justice Department have denounced.\n\n\"There's no shortage of opinions about our agency. ... My experience has been that every office I go to, every division I go to, has patriots. People who could do anything else with their careers but they've chosen to work for the FBI because they believe in serving others,\" Wray said. \"I encourage our folks not to get too hung up on what I consider to be the noise on TV and social media.\"", "keywords": ["spy", "committee", "russian", "coats", "agency", "national", "warn", "senate", "fbi", "2018", "persist", "elections", "bosses", "united", "threat", "congress", "intelligence"], "polarity": 0.03473974438260152, "subjectivity": 0.36754895897753054},

But the White House blueprint has already been overtaken by events. The two-year budget deal passed by Congress last week boosts spending for both the military and domestic programs by nearly $300 billion over the next two years, complicating White House efforts to reorder federal priorities.\n\n\"We really thought we could cut a deal with the Democrats that would increase defense spending in order to defend the nation,\" White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday. \"But when the doors closed, what happened was they would not give us a single dollar worth of additional defense spending without giving us additional money for welfare spending and that's just the world we live in.\"\n\nThe White House offered an amendment to its 2019 budget to account for the additional spending. It also suggested cuts that Congress could make in the current fiscal year.\n\n\"What we're doing is saying, 'Look, you don't have to spend all of this money,' \" Mulvaney said. \"These are spending caps. They're not spending floors. So you don't have to spend all that.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress largely ignored the proposed spending cuts in the president's first budget last year, but Mulvaney says the White House is not giving up. The administration's budget would cut funding for the State Department by 26 percent next year and would reduce spending at the EPA by 34 percent.\n\n\"There's still going to be the president's priorities as we seek to spend the money consistent with our priorities, not with the priorities that were reflected most by the Democrats in Congress,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe budget calls for $716 billion in defense spending in 2019, in line with the congressional deal. \"Our military was totally depleted, and we will have a military like we've never had before,\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House is also proposing stepped-up spending on border security, including $18 billion over the next two years for a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. In addition, the president wants funding for 750 more Border Patrol agents, 2,000 more ICE officers and 52,000 detention beds \u2014 a 25 percent increase from 2017.\n\nThe budget includes an ambitious, $1.5 trillion infrastructure program, although the bulk of the money for rebuilding roads, bridges and other projects would have to come from state and local governments or the private sector. \"We're trying to build roads and bridges and fix bridges that are falling down, and we have a hard time getting the money,\" Trump said during an infrastructure meeting at the White House on Monday. \"It's crazy.\"\n\nThe spending plan also calls for nearly $17 billion to combat opioid addiction.\n\nAnd it includes changes to safety net programs such as food stamps that the administration says will help move able-bodied Americans back into the workforce.\n\nThe White House budget assumes that economic growth will accelerate, from 2.3 percent last year to 3 percent this year and 3.2 percent next year, spurred on in part by the $1.5 trillion tax cut the president signed in December. Many independent economists see the White House forecast as overly optimistic. Even with the assumption of robust economic growth, the federal deficit is expected to hit 4.2 percent of GDP this year and 4.7 percent next year.\n\nIt's common for the deficit to grow during a recession, when tax revenues slump and spending on safety net programs increases. In 2009, for example, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. But it's very unusual for the government to run large deficits when the economy is near full employment as it is today.\n\n\"Certainly there's a risk that interest rates will spike and there's a concern,\" Mulvaney said. But he insisted that the tax cuts, while reducing revenue in the short run, will eventually pay off.\n\n\"This is not a fiscal stimulus. It's not a sugar high,\" Mulvaney said. \"We have fundamentally changed the structure of the American economy to where we think we can change the long-term trends of our growth possibilities.\"", "keywords": ["budget", "military", "trump", "white", "money", "border", "wrote", "check", "blueprint", "mulvaney", "offers", "house", "spending", "congress"], "polarity": 0.05623953823953825, "subjectivity": 0.24341147741147742},

Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty Images Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration is proposing a major shake-up in one of the country's most important \"safety net\" programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. Under the proposal, most SNAP recipients would lose much of their ability to choose the food they buy with their SNAP benefits.\n\nThe proposal is included in the Trump administration budget request for fiscal year 2019. It would require approval from Congress.\n\nUnder the proposal, which was announced Monday, low-income Americans who receive at least $90 a month \u2014 just over 80 percent of all SNAP recipients \u2014 would get about half of their benefits in the form of a \"USDA Foods package.\" The package was described in the budget as consisting of \"shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit and vegetables.\" The boxes would not include fresh fruits or vegetables.\n\nCurrently, SNAP beneficiaries get money loaded onto an EBT card they can use to buy what they want as long as it falls under the guidelines. The administration says the move is a \"cost-effective approach\" with \"no loss in food benefits to participants.\"\n\nThe USDA believes that state governments will be able to deliver this food at much less cost than SNAP recipients currently pay for food at retail stores \u2014 thus reducing the overall cost of the SNAP program by $129 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThis and other changes in the SNAP program, according to the Trump administration, will reduce the SNAP budget by $213 billion over those years \u2014 cutting the program by almost 30 percent.\n\nJoel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, a hunger advocacy group that also helps clients access food-assistance services, said the administration's plan left him baffled. \"They have managed to propose nearly the impossible, taking over $200 billion worth of food from low-income Americans while increasing bureaucracy and reducing choices,\" Berg says.\n\nHe says SNAP is efficient because it is a \"free market model\" that lets recipients shop at stores for their benefits. The Trump administration's proposal, he said, \"is a far more intrusive, Big Government answer. They think a bureaucrat in D.C. is better at picking out what your family needs than you are?\"\n\nDouglas Greenaway, president of the National WIC Association, echoed that sentiment. \"Removing choice from SNAP flies in the face of encouraging personal responsibility,\" he said. He says \"the budget seems to assume that participating in SNAP is a character flaw.\"\n\nIt isn't clear how billions of dollars' worth of food each year would be distributed to millions of SNAP recipients who live all over the country, including dense urban areas and sparsely populated rural regions. The budget says states will have \"substantial flexibility in designing the food box delivery system through existing infrastructure, partnerships or commercial/retail delivery services.\"\n\nCritics of the proposal said distributing that much food presents a logistical nightmare. \"Among the problems, it's going to be costly and take money out of the [SNAP] program from the administrative side. It's going to stigmatize people when they have to go to certain places to pick up benefits,\" says Jim Weill, president of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center.\n\nStacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, called the proposal \"radical and risky.\" The idea that the government could save money by distributing food itself, she said, is \"ill-informed at best.\"\n\nIt isn't clear whether the boxes will come with directions on how to cook the foods inside. \"It could be something that [SNAP recipients] don't even know how to make,\" notes Miguelina Diaz, whose team at Hunger Free America works directly with families to help them access food aid. \"We deal with different people of different backgrounds. Limiting them by providing them a staple box would limit the choices of food they can prepare for their families.\"\n\nAccording to Dean, from CBPP, the Trump administration wants to trim an additional $80 billion from the SNAP program by cutting off about 4 million people who currently receive food assistance. Most of them live in states that have decided to loosen the program's eligibility requirements slightly. Under the administration's proposal, states would no longer be able to do so.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in early December that he wanted states to have more flexibility in doling out SNAP, announcing the agency wanted to hear about programs from states that don't increase the cost of the program and will combat what he said is fraud and waste. At the National Grocers Association conference over the weekend, Perdue said the budget has \"common-sense reforms that call for greater consistency across nutritional programs.\"\n\nNutrition programs, including SNAP, made up about 80 percent of the USDA's budget in the most recent farm bill, making it the largest portion of agency spending. About 44 million people participated in SNAP each month in 2016, at an annual cost of $70.9 billion. Nearly two-thirds were under 18, over 60 or disabled, according to the USDA.\n\nCongress largely ignored Trump's proposed budget for SNAP last year, when he wanted to cut the funding by a quarter. This time, it's a farm bill year, meaning many budgetary decisions will be made among the House and Senate agriculture committees.\n\nSeveral critics we spoke with expressed skepticism that the proposed SNAP changes would pass in Congress. Even so, Weill says, \"Whenever you see proposals like this that attack [SNAP] ... it harms the program even if it doesn't pass, in the long term reducing support for the program and stigmatizing people who use it.\"", "keywords": ["budget", "billion", "trump", "wants", "administration", "program", "states", "food", "proposal", "snap", "recipients", "decide"], "polarity": 0.11870782403870639, "subjectivity": 0.37512254901960784},

The goal is for the Senate to vote on immigration proposals and amendments from every corner of the political spectrum. Anything that can get 60 votes will pass; everything else will fall by the wayside.\n\nMany in Congress have been craving such an open debate because it will give senators a chance to put their concepts and proposals to the ultimate legislative test. The plan carries a significant political risk that none of the ideas will have enough votes to pass, leaving Congress unable to fulfill its pledge to protect the roughly 700,000 people enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\n\"Whoever gets to 60 wins,\" McConnell told reporters at a news conference on Feb. 6. He added, \"There's no secret plan here to try to push this in any direction. The Senate is going to work its will, and I hope that we will end up passing something.\"\n\nThe hazy Senate process is expected to include votes on a wide range of proposals, including a version of a framework released in January by the White House. On Monday, McConnell threw his support behind that outline, which is being introduced in a bill by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; John Cornyn, R-Texas; and others.\n\n\"This legislation is a fair compromise that addresses the stated priorities of all sides,\" McConnell said.\n\nThat framework set out four pillars that the White House wants to see addressed in any legislation: legal status for DACA recipients, more spending on border security, ending the visa program that lets immigrants in the U.S. bring their family members over, and eliminating the diversity visa lottery.\n\nGrassley called his bill a \"compassionate compromise\" and said if Democrats and others want to protect DACA recipients, they would support this plan endorsed by Trump.\n\n\"Are you interested in actually getting something done, in actually providing a path to citizenship for these DACA kids, or are you interested in a political issue for the 2018 elections?\" Grassley posited on the Senate floor to his colleagues.\n\nEven those senators who haven't supported the White House's position were optimistic about the process that was going to begin playing out.\n\n\"We're going to have something in the Senate that we haven't had in a while,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \"It's a real debate on an issue where we really don't know what the outcome is going to be.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday on the floor that \"the key is to find a consensus bill, largely acceptable to a significant number of members of both parties\" and cautioned Republicans against pressing for too much as they're up against such a critical DACA deadline.\n\n\"Democrats are fully committed to protecting the DREAMers, and we have long supported effective border security. Many Republicans are in the same boat. The only enemy to this process is overreach,\" Schumer said. \"Now is not the time nor the place to reform the entire legal immigration system. Rather, this is the moment for a narrow bill. And every ounce of our energy is going into finding one that can pass.\"\n\nStill, the outcome remains particularly uncertain because the Senate debate is just the start of a longer process of passing an immigration package. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has not yet said how the House will proceed beyond promising to vote on an immigration bill, so long as it has the support of President Trump.\n\nThat promise has Democrats and other critics worried that the House could block whatever the Senate is able to pass. Ryan addressed those critics last week, telling reporters that he plans to hold a vote on immigration.\n\n\"To anyone who doubts my intention to solve this problem and bring up a DACA and immigration reform bill, do not,\" Ryan said. \"We will bring a solution to the floor, one the president will sign.\"\n\nThe White House has not weighed in on any of the legislative options, but Trump has insisted that any immigration bill also include funding for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nThe legislative rush comes after months of congressional inaction following Trump's announcement in September that the administration would stop renewing DACA applications in March. The program was created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama to provide legal protections to immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children.\n\nThe program is currently caught in a court battle, but Congress has vowed to act before the deadline \u2014 giving it just three weeks to pass a bill.", "keywords": ["starts", "jump", "white", "ball", "bill", "senate", "process", "daca", "going", "debate", "house", "pass", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.10956934686442886, "subjectivity": 0.41995836586000507},

In a message accompanying the plan for the years 2018 through 2022, Mulvaney wrote, \"we have committed to fulfill the Bureau's statutory responsibilities, but go no further.\" The plan says the bureau should be \"acting with humility and moderation.\"\n\nThis new direction is consistent with Mulvaney's other memos and statements and formalizes his plans for defanging the watchdog bureau and reshaping its mission, according to insiders and experts that NPR has talked to.\n\nThe CFPB is considered a powerful and independent watchdog. But many Republicans have wanted to shut it down since Day 1 because they think it's too powerful. Mulvaney is one of them. As a congressman, Mulvaney called the agency a \"sick sad joke.\" He drafted legislation to abolish it. So people at the bureau were shocked when the president appointed him to run this consumer protection agency.\n\nWithin weeks of coming on board, Mulvaney has worked to make the watchdog agency less aggressive. Under his leadership, the CFPB delayed a new payday lending regulation from going into effect and dropped an investigation into one payday lender that contributed to Mulvaney's campaign. In another move that particularly upset some staffers, the new boss also dropped a lawsuit against an alleged online loan shark called Golden Valley Lending. The suit says the lender illegally charges people up to 950 percent interest rates. It took CFPB staffers years to build the case.\n\n\"People are devastated and angry \u2014 just imagine how you would feel if years of your life had been dedicated to pursuing justice and you lose everything,\" says Christopher Peterson, a former Office of Enforcement attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who worked on this particular case early on.\n\nPeterson believes that had the lawsuit been pursued and the CFPB won, it could have clawed back money to help thousands of people who have allegedly been hurt by the lender.\n\nPeople like Julie Bonenfant, 27, who does administrative work for the city of Detroit. Last year was a tough one for her \u2014 she broke up with her boyfriend, her car was stolen and she got behind on her rent. She found Golden Valley Lending online and and took out a loan, but she says she had no idea what she was getting herself into.\n\n\"I was literally facing eviction because I was so behind on my rent and I had no idea where I was going to come up with the money and it was just really rough,\" Bonenfant says. \"It was just misleading. ... The way it was presented was ... I was going to make four large payments and then be done.\"\n\nBut after those four payments, the lender continued to take money directly out of her checking account. When she asked why, the lender told her she had agreed online to a lot more payments.\n\nBonenfant sent NPR a screenshot from the Golden Valley website. It says on her $900 loan, her scheduled payments in less than 12 months will total $3,735, or more than four times what she borrowed.\n\nBonenfant has so far paid more than $3,000 to Golden Valley and rung up more than $1,000 in overdraft fees at her bank.\n\nWhen she showed it to her boss, he called the loan's terms \"illegal.\"\n\nLawyers at the CFPB came to a similar conclusion. That's why back in April, the bureau sued Golden Valley Lending for unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices.\n\nThe lawsuit was moving forward until Mulvaney came on board, when it was suddenly dropped.\n\n\"Dismissal of this lawsuit shows an outrageous disregard for the rule of law,\" says Peterson, who calls the lender \"one of the worst of the worst\" for swindling many people around the nation out of tens of millions of dollars.\n\nA key backer of Golden Valley was recently convicted of racketeering charges in a case involving another online lender, according to court documents. Given this history, Peterson wonders why Mulvaney dropped the lawsuit against Golden Valley.\n\n\"The Trump administration is just going to turn them loose and let them off the hook despite the fact they were making 950 percent interest rate loans to struggling families in ways that were illegal and unauthorized under both state and federal law,\" Peterson says.\n\nMulvaney declined requests for an interview. In an email, his press representative first said the decision to drop the Golden Valley lawsuit was made by \"professional career staff\" and not Mulvaney.\n\nBut several CFPB staffers that NPR spoke to say that's not true. The staffers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, say Mulvaney decided to drop the lawsuit even though the entire career enforcement staff wanted to press ahead with it.\n\nAfter repeated questioning from NPR, Mulvaney's press person acknowledged that Mulvaney was indeed involved in the decision to drop the lawsuit.\n\nIn his new strategic plan and in memos to staff, Mulvaney has made it clear that he wants to rein in the bureau.\n\nHe says the previous director \"pushed the envelope\" and has said he wants the agency to have more \"humility.\" He has also suggested that going after payday lenders that charge extremely high interest rates won't be a priority.\n\nSome see this as Mulvaney's way of paying back supporters of his campaign.\n\n\"As a congressman he took $62,000 plus from the payday lenders. And now at the CFPB he's doing their bidding,\" says Karl Frisch, executive director of the consumer group Allied Progress.\n\nOf course, Mulvaney's moves could be just conservative ideology for less regulation. But in either case, there appear to be plenty of unhappy customers who have gotten loans from Golden Valley.\n\nRobert Rogers, who builds customized motorcycles and guns, says he was trying to help his retired mother in California after she got into one of these Golden Valley loans. The cost of the loan seemed really high, so he called the company.\n\nRogers says the person who answered the call from Golden Valley wouldn't answer his questions about what the interest rate on the loan was and just kept telling him he had to pay and even threatened him \u2014 saying he'd come to his house and get the money \"by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Pretty much every other word out of his mouth was F'in this or F'in that. ... It became like some kind of just really bad gangster movie,\" Rogers says.\n\nGolden Valley declined an interview. The company is officially headquartered on an Indian reservation. In a court document, the company argues its loans are governed by tribal law.\n\nThe CFPB lawsuit disagreed, saying Golden Valley makes illegal loans across the country.\n\nFor her part, Bonenfant still hasn't paid off her debt to Golden Valley. And she feels betrayed by the president, whose appointee dropped the lawsuit.\n\n\"To be honest I'm really mad, really pissed, because I actually voted for Trump,\" Bonenfant says. \"So knowing that his guy threw out this case that affects people like me, I feel kind of like stupid \u2014 just kind of like betrayed.\"\n\nMulvaney hasn't officially offered details about why the case was dropped. Meanwhile, staffers at the bureau say they are worried Mulvaney will block more of their efforts to go after shady financial firms. He is reviewing numerous ongoing lawsuits and investigations.", "keywords": ["watchdog", "cfpb", "golden", "plans", "trump", "administration", "bureau", "valley", "lawsuit", "consumer", "mulvaney", "really", "defang", "lender", "loans", "protection", "staffers"], "polarity": 0.010448736448736451, "subjectivity": 0.47845931317359885},

But a 10 percent drop in the markets can affect our attitudes about the economy, even for those who don't invest, says James Poterba, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nWhen the stock market goes up, people typically spend more. Even if most of that spending is concentrated among people with high incomes, it still powers the economy. According to Poterba's research, every extra $1 of disposable income in your stock portfolio leads to about 2 to 3 cents in additional spending.\n\n\"It might also have a psychological effect,\" he added. \"Even those who don't have much in the stock market feel that it's an indicator of how things are going.\"\n\nSo a major decline in the markets could precipitate a pullback in consumer spending if enough people are unnerved psychologically.\n\nAnd despite President Trump's conflation of the stock markets with the overall well-being of the economy, just a small percentage of American households own stocks. Trump has made a habit of using the stock market and its incremental fluctuations as a sign of the overall economy's health.\n\n\"The most important thing to understand about stock ownership in the U.S. economy is that it is a very concentrated thing,\" said Poterba. \"Many people hold no stock at all and have no exposure directly to the stock market.\"\n\nOnly 13.9 percent of U.S. families directly hold stocks, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve, and that number has been dropping year after year. If 401(k) retirement accounts and mutual funds are included, that number increases to 51.9 percent.\n\nStill, that means roughly half of all American families do not invest in the markets in any fashion (separate polls from Gallup and the Census Bureau back up this data point).\n\nMoreover, stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy \u2014 84 percent of all stocks are owned by the richest 10 percent of Americans.\n\ntoggle caption Data Provided by Edward Wolff NYU/ Credit: Asma Khalid/NPR\n\nThat number is actually a lot higher than it used to be according to Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University, who's written on the topic. \"In 2001, for example, the richest 10 percent owned only 77 percent of all stocks,\" he said.\n\ntoggle caption Data Provided By Edward Wolff/NYU Credit: Asma Khalid/NPR\n\nMIT's Poterba points out that even among those investing in the market, three-quarters of American families own less than $25,000.\n\nMost people investing in the stock market are white, college-educated, urbanites, according to the Fed's survey. And, they're more likely to live in the Northeast. The Fed data also found that those under the age of 35 or in a single-parent household are less likely to invest.\n\nAs a comparison, the Fed survey shows that 61 percent of white families own stocks, compared to just 31 percent of black families and 28 percent of Hispanic families.\n\nNYU's Wolff points out that age and racial stock market disparities are in line with overall wealth disparities, but it's also evidence that blacks, Latinos and young people don't invest in the market as much as their older white counterparts because they're putting their savings elsewhere.\n\n\"African-Americans and Latinos have fairly low stock ownership rates, and that's a reflection of the fact that most of their savings go into buying a home,\" said Wolff. He said young people, despite stories to the contrary, are also opting for a home over stocks.\n\nSo rich, college-educated whites are disproportionately investing in the market, as are foreigners. Steven Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center estimates foreigners own about 35 percent of U.S. corporate stock.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Trump has eagerly taken credit for the 20 percent increase in the Dow Jones industrial average since his inauguration.\n\nThe risk for Trump is that presidential approval ratings often decline when the economy hits a rough patch. Trump is already quite unpopular with large parts of the electorate, but his approval rating has started to tick up recently, as more Americans also give him credit for the good economy.\n\nFor most Americans who do dabble in the market, their investments are essentially retirement income, so except for those who are at or near retirement age, a one-day drop or two-week boom is unlikely to affect day-to-day finances. And that means for many people the immediate impact of a rocky market is mostly psychological. Still, for a president who's banked his economic reputation on the health of the stock market \u2014 another turbulent week could be a risk to his ratings.", "keywords": ["rock", "data", "market", "trump", "families", "stocks", "credit", "swings", "wolff", "wallets", "economy", "stock", "markets", "minds"], "polarity": 0.14866057900432894, "subjectivity": 0.4028931277056277},

The meeting took place shortly after John Podesta's Gmail account was breached, in addition to the earlier hack of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIt remains unclear what, if anything, Papadopoulos told the campaign about that conversation. A key question in the Mueller investigation is what Papadopoulos told the campaign, and what, if anything, the campaign did with that information.\n\nBut after the charges became public, the White House immediately distanced itself from Papadopoulos.\n\nEmbedded Trump Stories: Collusion Trump Stories: Collusion Listen \u00b7 1:06:31 1:06:31\n\n\"He was somebody that played a minimal role, if one at all,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said last fall.\n\n\"I never heard of Papadopoulos,\" former Trump adviser Michael Caputo told CNN. \"He was the coffee boy.\"\n\nMore recently, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee and an ally of the Trump White House, told Fox News that Papadopoulos \"never even had met with the president.\"\n\nThis is false. Then-candidate Trump tweeted a photo of a foreign policy meeting with several advisers, including Papadopoulos. Nunes' recently released memo also makes clear that the FBI began its investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential race and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign because of Papadopoulos.\n\nPapadopoulos himself has not spoken publicly since he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, leaving the administration's narrative more or less unchallenged.\n\nBut his fiancee, Simona Mangiante, has decided to defend Papadopoulos whenever journalists will listen, and is telling a much different story than the one coming from the White House.\n\n\"I felt this frustration for him,\" Mangiante tells NPR's Embedded. \"And that's why I accepted to speak.\"\n\nA meeting over LinkedIn\n\nMangiante is from Italy, and she first met Papadopoulos after the presidential campaign, when Papadopoulos sent her a message on LinkedIn. Mangiante and Papadopoulos had both briefly worked at the same office in London \u2014 the London Centre for International Law Practice \u2014 though at different times. That office was run by the \"professor\" described in court papers filed by the special counsel's office, a man later identified as the Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud.\n\nMifsud has previously worked in Malta's foreign ministry and ran a university in Slovenia.\n\nHe has denied any connections to the Russian government and denied ever telling Papadopoulos about \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, but since the fall, he has largely disappeared. He did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nMangiante's story is now providing new detail about Mifsud, but she acknowledges that he remains mysterious even to her.\n\nMangiante first got to know Mifsud when she worked as a legal adviser to the European Parliament, and he recruited her.\n\n\"He was interested to hire young people with political connections,\" she says, \"to have access to their networks.\"\n\nShe says she worked in Mifsud's London office for about three months, but to this day, she does not understand what she was supposed to do at the office. There was \"no work agenda,\" she says, and the office consisted of a single table and a rotating group of people working on their own laptops.\n\nAt one point, she says, she was asked to attend a \"secret symposium\" on Iraq, but the organizers would not tell her key details, like who else would be attending. She received a plane ticket, but decided not to go, given the secrecy.\n\nShe also says she was never paid for her work, and after three months, she decided to leave. (Mangiante shared her resignation letter with NPR, where she mentions the lack of pay.)\n\nFor nearly a year, Mangiante says her experience with Mifsud remained a bit of a mystery. But now that the U.S. government alleges that Mifsud had connections to the Russian government, she says \"it makes sense.\"\n\nSince the allegations came out, the London Centre for International Law Practice appears to have shut down. When NPR's Frank Langfitt recently tried to visit the office, he was turned away.\n\nThe investigation\n\nMangiante says her relationship with Papadopoulos began around April 2017, and it was \"love at first sight.\" A few months later, after a European vacation the young couple took, Papadopoulos was arrested after arriving at Dulles International Airport in the Washington, D.C., area. He later entered a guilty plea for lying to the FBI and is cooperating with authorities.\n\nMangiante says she has also been questioned by federal agents.\n\nShe says she cannot speak on behalf of Papadopoulos, on the advice of his lawyers. But she wants to correct the record about her fiance and his role on the campaign, which she says was much larger than the White House claims.\n\nFor one, Mangiante confirmed to NPR that Papadopoulos organized a meeting between Donald Trump and the president of Egypt during the campaign, a story first reported by The New York Times.\n\n\"I never heard of anybody bringing coffee and organizing meetings with presidents,\" she says.\n\nShe also confirmed that Papadopoulos helped edit Donald Trump's April 2016 foreign policy speech, where Trump said, \"I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia \u2014 from a position of strength only \u2014 is possible. Absolutely possible.\"\n\nWhen NPR asked if everything Papadopoulos did during the campaign was authorized by the top levels of the campaign, she responded unequivocally:\n\n\"Yes. That's my understanding.\"\n\nShe also says it will be \"easy to prove\" how significant Papadopoulos' role was, because \"all of his communication, professional communication with other people with the campaign, [was] via email.\"\n\nOnce Papadopoulos is sentenced for lying to the FBI, Mangiante says, he will finally be able to tell his side of the story. \"After sentencing, he will definitely talk,\" she says. \"And he will say everything I can't say.\"\n\nIn the meantime, she is spending time with Papadopoulos in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nAnd she recently made a new purchase.\n\n\"I bought for George a coffee machine,\" she says, \"and he was laughing at me.

That's more than half of all federal jobs. Another 1.2 million government contractors held clearances, as of 2015.\n\nNational Security Agency Conducting Government Background Checks Has Backlog Of 700,000 Agency Conducting Government Background Checks Has Backlog Of 700,000 Listen \u00b7 4:09 4:09\n\nAnd the government is running into what security experts warn is a major problem \u2014 a mounting backlog that is hampering critical functions of the government. Some 700,000 people are waiting to have clearances processed, according to a report issued last week by the U.S. Comptroller's office, and many see the process as broken.\n\nThe problem is so acute that the Government Accountability Office two weeks ago added it to its list of \"high-risk\" programs \"in need of either broad-based transformation or specific reforms to prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\"\n\n\"A high-quality and timely personnel security clearance process is essential to minimize the risks of unauthorized disclosures of classified information and to help ensure that information about individuals with criminal histories or other questionable behavior is identified and assessed,\" U.S. Comptroller Gene Dodaro noted. \"Our objective for the High Risk List is to bring attention to policymakers of the need for action sooner, rather than later. Renewed and strong top leadership commitment will be critical to facilitate progress in reducing the backlog and completing key improvements to the personnel security clearance process.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner agrees.\n\n\"We are wasting money hiring people, then not allowing them to do their job that they were hired for, because they may have to wait months or in certain cases even beyond a year before they get the security clearance,\" the Democrat from Virginia and ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee told NPR.\n\nThe Porter situation\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said Thursday that Porter was working under an interim security clearance while his background check was being completed. For White House employees, President Trump, as commander in chief, can determine which executive branch workers have access to classified documents.\n\nThe FBI conducted interviews with Porter's former spouses, and the New York Times reported that Porter told his second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, that he believed the allegations against him had delayed his receiving a security clearance. His first wife, Colbie Holderness, released photos of herself with a black eye. Porter denies the allegations.\n\nA second White House official, David Sorensen, was forced out Friday after allegations of domestic abuse by a former spouse surfaced. Sorensen was a speechwriter. He, too, denies to allegations. A White House official told NPR's Tamara Keith that Sorensen's position did not require a security clearance, but that his background check was ongoing.\n\nPresident Trump seemed to leap to their defense Saturday, tweeting that \"peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tweeted Thursday, however, that there were \"chilling lapses in security and background clearance process shown by Rob Porter's access to classified info.\"\n\nThe problem is that with something like this in a White House official's background \u2014 something that could and did cost him his job \u2014 national-security experts warn that that person could be subject to blackmail by a foreign or domestic adversary. That's especially true when it comes to a person with close access to the president, like one responsible for putting the papers the president reads in front him.\n\nWhat's more, the Washington Post reports this was not an isolated incident, and there's something of a security-clearance backlog at the White House, too:\n\n\"Dozens of White House employees are awaiting permanent security clearances and have been working for months with temporary approvals to handle sensitive information while the FBI continues to probe their backgrounds, according to U.S. officials.\"\n\nThat includes the president's son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner, who has been a subject in the ongoing Robert Mueller Russia probe.\n\nSo how do security clearances actually work?\n\nThe process throughout government to receive a security clearance is complex.\n\nClearances range from \"confidential,\" the lowest level, to \"secret\" and \"top secret.\n\n\"You're looking at anyone from the guy that washes dishes in the White House all the way up to Ph.D.-level scientists doing, you know, nuclear and biological work,\" said Evan Lesser, founder and president of ClearanceJobs, a website that attempts to match job applicants to openings in the government and with contractors.\n\nHe said security clearances are needed not just because a worker deals with classified documents \u2014 maybe they just work near them.\n\n\"That's why you'll have someone who is working in the White House in a blue-collar position, needs a security clearance,\" Lesser said. \"So someone who's fixing the air conditioning in a government contracting facility needs a security clearance. It's not just spy work, as most people think when they talk about security clearances.\"\n\nWith all those jobs requiring security clearances, it stands to reason there's a bit of a wait to get one. The government has investigators and hires other contractors to conduct background checks of job applicants.\n\n\"At the basic level, they're going to look at, are you financially sound, your employment history, kind of the basics. Do you have a criminal record?\" said Meagan Metzger, founder of Dcode, which helps companies work with the government. She herself held a Top Secret clearance at the Defense Department.\n\nAnd for a Top Secret clearance, Metzger said there's a lot more that goes into it.\n\n\"It's going to go much deeper than that,\" she said. \"They're going to talk to everyone you know, everyone you've lived with. They're going to conduct a polygraph. They're going to kind of do a lot more investigation into your background.\"\n\nThat can take time. For a Top Secret clearance, sometimes it can be more than a year. So what happens, in many instances, agencies hire applicants because of their skills, but then they can't be put into the jobs until they get their clearance.\n\nAnd guess what? While they wait, many of the applicants are being paid, even though they're not filling the jobs they were hired for by government agencies or by contractors who fear the qualified applicants will take their skills elsewhere.\n\nWarner, who has called for reforming the clearance approval process says it's a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n\"That's not an efficient way to run an operation,\" Warner said. \"And many of these individuals have talents and skills, particularly as we move into the technology field, where they are desperately needed.\"\n\nOne reason for the backlog is the often low-tech methods investigators use to conduct background checks.

But, the proposal will not be one that offers large sums of federal funding to states for infrastructure needs, but it is instead a financing plan that shifts much of the funding burden onto the states and onto local governments.\n\nCritics say that will lead to higher state and local taxes, and an increased reliance on user fees, such as tolls, water and sewer fees, transit fares and airline ticket taxes.\n\nSenior White House officials who briefed reporters over the weekend say the plan is aimed at fixing the current system of funding infrastructure that they say is broken in two ways.\n\nThe first is that the country has been under-investing in infrastructure, leading a state of growing disrepair. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation a grade of D+ for the condition of transit, highway, bridge, rail, water and other infrastructure, and says the country is in need of an investment of $2 trillion more than is currently budgeted.\n\nThe second way the White House says the system is broken is in the lengthy federal permitting process, which officials say can take five to 10 years or longer, driving up costs.\n\nA program that would flip funding burden\n\nAdministration officials say the president's plan addresses the funding shortfall by committing $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, will be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.\n\nSo, for example, if a state has a project or need identified and can come up with 80 or 90 percent of the funding for it through increased state or local taxes, like the gas tax, or with user fees like tolls, then under this plan, the federal government would kick in the rest.\n\nCritics worry that would lead to only projects that could generate revenue, such as toll roads or bridges, getting funded.\n\nThat's a radical departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. This program would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, this plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nTo address concerns that projects in rural areas don't have the ability to generate much in user fees, the White House plan calls for spending $50 billion of the $200 billion on rural infrastructure needs. That funding would go to states in the form of block grants, giving governors and state legislatures the authority to figure out the best way to spend that money.\n\nAnd $20 billion would go to federal loan programs that are aimed at attracting private investment in infrastructure, and into private activity bonds.\n\nProjects with an eye to the future\n\n\n\nThe White House also wants to earmark $20 billion in funding for \"transformative\" projects, which a White House official says \"have a vision towards the future.\" These would be \"projects that can lift the American spirit, that are the next-century-type of infrastructure as opposed to just rebuilding what we have currently.\"\n\nThe remaining $10 billion would go into a capital financing fund, which the administration says would go toward funding federal government office building infrastructure.\n\nThe $200 billion in federal funding would not be new revenue but would come from cuts \"in other areas of the federal budget,\" some of which will be outlined in the president's budget plan that will also be released Monday. That includes funding cuts to existing federal transit programs, the TIGER grant program \"and things where the administration thinks that infrastructure funds haven't been spent efficaciously,\" said a senior administration official.\n\nBut the White House officials say this new infrastructure plan \"is a program that sits on top of existing programs. So we're not proposing eliminating the Highway Trust Fund, or changing the state revolving funds. So to the extent that communities are eligible for federal funds already, that eligibility remains.\"\n\nTrump wants to streamline federal environmental review\n\nThe president's plan does not address a huge yearly shortfall in the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the federal gasoline tax. That tax of 18.4 cents a gallon for unleaded, 24.4 cents a gallon for diesel, hasn't been raised in 25 years and because of improvements in fuel efficiency and inflation, it raises less money now than it did when last raised in 1993. So Congress is already using deficit spending to pay for some transportation infrastructure needs funded by existing programs.\n\nIn addition to the financing component of the plan, Trump wants to significantly streamline the federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure construction projects, which they say can often involve several different federal agencies that can drag the process out. The president's plan will call for the creation of \"One Agency, One Decision\" type of process that would put one lead federal agency in charge of completing an environmental review within 21 months.\n\nPresident Trump will outline some of these principles in a meeting with mayors and other state and local leaders at the White House Monday. Trump will work with Congress to make changes, if needed. The infrastructure spending plan would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate so it will need democratic support, but the White House officials say this is one issue on which there should be room to compromise, because they say the president's infrastructure plan is in line with priorities and objectives outlined by members of both parties in Congress, even if not in the way it would be funded.\n\n\"This is in no way, shape or form ... a take it or leave it proposal,\" said one senior administration official. \"This is the start of a negotiation.\"\n\n\"The president has said he is open to new sources of funding,\" the White House aide said. \"We want it to be bipartisan.\"", "keywords": ["billion", "trump", "funding", "white", "plan", "state", "federal", "infrastructure", "say", "projects", "house", "longawaited", "15", "unveil", "trillion"], "polarity": 0.05675437746333269, "subjectivity": 0.2630055889384248},

That's what happened on Friday in a flurry of rumors about Kelly's standing with Trump.\n\nPolitics Chief Of Staff John Kelly Faces Questions On Immigration Comments, Handling Of Staff Chief Of Staff John Kelly Faces Questions On Immigration Comments, Handling Of Staff Listen \u00b7 3:53 3:53\n\nThe mounting days of bad press about the handling of Porter \u2014 who knew what and when, the problem with his security clearance \u2014 are just the latest in a series of instances of Kelly drawing the wrong kind of attention.\n\nAnd it's causing people to rethink the one overriding piece of conventional wisdom about Kelly, the retired four-star Marine general and former Homeland Security secretary who came into the White House after a chaotic period of backbiting and staff turnover.\n\n\"He's supposed to be the adult in the room. He's supposed to be that guiding light. He's supposed to give maturity, right?\" asked Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill.\n\nHe initially thought Kelly was someone he could work with on immigration issues. He said Kelly presented himself as an ally within the administration. Lately, Gutierrez has been questioning who Kelly really is.\n\nThe Rob Porter problem\n\nWhen Kelly became chief of staff, he said he saw his job as managing the staff, not President Trump or his Twitter feed. But in the case of Porter, it was Kelly's management of the staff that is in question.\n\nThe Porter story first broke Tuesday night in the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which reported that his two ex-wives had accused him of mental and physical abuse. The initial reaction of the White House was to defend Porter, who under Kelly had taken on an increasingly important role in the Trump White House. He was the man tasked with controlling the flow of information into the Oval Office. He often traveled with the president and was involved in crafting the State of the Union address.\n\nKelly, in a statement Tuesday praised Porter, saying he was \"a man of true integrity and honor,\" Kelly told the Daily Mail. \"I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional.\"\n\nPorter denies the allegations and in a statement released Wednesday described it as part of a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nWednesday, photos of Porter's first wife with a black eye came out, and Porter resigned. Still, the White House and Kelly stood by him, with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisting he hadn't been pushed out.\n\n\n\n\"The president and chief of staff have had full confidence and trust in his abilities and performance,\" Sanders read from the podium in the press briefing room.\n\nIt was only late Wednesday that the White House released a new statement from Kelly.\n\n\"I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter. There is no place for domestic violence in our society. I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming Chief of Staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation,\" the statement from Kelly said.\n\nCome Thursday, White House spokesman Raj Shah admitted the White House could have done a better job of dealing with the situation.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Kelly had long been aware that there were abuse allegations against Porter. His permanent security clearance had been held up over them. But it wasn't until those allegations went public that any action was taken.\n\n\"I worry about John,\" said Panetta in an interview with NPR. \"Because look, he is first and foremost a Marine. He is not a politician.\"\n\nPanetta said the mistakes of the last several days may be something a general could get away with. But now Kelly is the White House chief of staff.\n\n\n\n\"You've got to have political judgment and you've got to think ahead as to what can happen that could damage the president and, for whatever reason, that didn't happen here and he's now going to pay a price for that,\" said Panetta.\n\n\n\nIt's not clear what that price will be, if any. As of Thursday, Shah insisted President Trump continues to have full confidence in Kelly. But numerous news outlets were reporting that the president was privately venting about his chief of staff.\n\nDescribing DREAMers as lazy\n\nThis all came in the same week that Kelly used crude and racially insensitive language to describe immigrants eligible for the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program but who hadn't applied for the program's protections.\n\n\"...[P]eople that some would say were too afraid to sign up. Others would say were too lazy to get off their asses but they didn't sign up,\" Kelly said to reporters Tuesday as he discussed the White House offer of a path to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million people eligible for the DACA program as part of a larger immigration system overhaul.\n\nLater the same day Kelly suggested some of them \"just should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.\"\n\nThis caused massive backlash from congressional Democrats, and again made Kelly the story.\n\nFor Gutierrez this was both deeply offensive and something of a last straw.\n\n\"You can read a book, you can read the public policy, you can get educated,\" Gutierrez said. \"It's really hard to get a heart.\"\n\n\"Evolved\" on the wall\n\nLast month, Kelly ran afoul of President Trump when in a closed-door Congressional Hispanic Caucus meeting, and then later in an interview on Fox News he said the president's views on the border wall had \"evolved.\"\n\n\"He has evolved in the way he's looked at things,\" Kelly said on Fox. \"Campaigning to governing are two different things and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible.\"\n\nThe next morning Trump took to Twitter to rebut his chief of staff and get the last word.\n\nFalsely attacking a congresswoman\n\n\n\nAnd then there was last fall, when Kelly came to the White House briefing room to defend President Trump. After a condolence call to the widow of a soldier, Trump was accused of being insensitive. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., was in the car and overheard the call and was the main voice criticizing the president.\n\nAt first Kelly, who is a Gold Star father himself, described in painful detail the notification process for families of deceased troops. It was powerful and wrenching. Kelly explained how Trump may have repeated something Kelly had told him about his own experience and it inadvertently came out sounding different than intended.\n\nBut then, Kelly went further, going after Wilson and calling her an \"empty barrel,\" as in empty barrels make the most noise. He described an event where he claimed she was inappropriately self-promotional.\n\n\"We were stunned. Stunned that she'd done it,\" Kelly said. \"Even for somebody that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.\"\n\nThe problem is, further reporting revealed that what Kelly described didn't happen. Kelly never apologized, even after it became clear his recollection wasn't accurate.", "keywords": ["porter", "way", "came", "allegations", "white", "trump", "president", "kelly", "house", "good", "staff", "spotlight", "finds", "chief"], "polarity": 0.04902819402819402, "subjectivity": 0.3753890553890556},

But they're afraid to, because they're in the country illegally, and they don't have driver's licenses.\n\nSo most days, Olvera drives them to work.\n\nOlvera is 26 years old, and looks even younger, with curly black hair and a baby face. But he's taken on a lot of responsibility. On paper, Olvera owns the family business. Even the house where they live, on a leafy street in Dalton, Georgia, is in his name.\n\n\"People ask me, do you still live with your parents?,\" Olvera joked. \"I'll say no, my parents live with me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin D. Liles for NPR Kevin D. Liles for NPR\n\nThe reason Olvera can do all these things for his family is DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Obama-era program protects about 700,000 of the so-called DREAMers \u2014 people who were brought to the country illegally as children \u2014 from deportation, and allows them to work legally.\n\nBut those protections are in jeopardy unless Congress takes action. The Senate will turn its attention to hashing out an immigration deal this week. And there's a lot stake \u2014 not just for the DREAMers, but for all the parents, siblings and other relatives who rely on them.\n\nOlvera has talked publicly about his family's situation and lobbied Congress for legislation to protect DREAMers.\n\nHis mother and father arrived in the U.S. on a temporary visa almost 20 years ago, and stayed. The family wants to share their story but the parents asked not to be named because they fear being deported. Still, Olvera's mother says her family can have a better life here.\n\n\"If you're a respectful, educated, hard-working person,\" she said through a translator, \"the U.S. will always open its doors for you.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin D. Liles for NPR Kevin D. Liles for NPR\n\nIt was DACA that opened doors for the family, by giving Olvera and his brother protection from deportation.\n\nDREAMers often become the de facto ambassadors for their families, in many aspects of daily life. The family bank accounts and credit cards are often in their names. They fill in for parents who are scared to attend parent-teacher conferences. They're able to go to college and get better jobs. One study found that DACA improves the economic situation of almost two-thirds of these families.\n\nBut the Trump administration has moved to end DACA as early as March, saying that Congress needs to come up with a replacement.\n\nOlvera says his protections would expire in August.\n\n\"I'm like a jug of milk, man. It's marked on there, and you don't know what to do after that,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things that go into limbo.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin D. Liles for NPR Kevin D. Liles for NPR\n\nPolls consistently show that a majority of Americans favor allowing DREAMers to stay in the country. But common ground in Washington has been hard to find.\n\nThe White House has floated a plan that includes a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million DREAMers. That number includes the roughly 700,000 who are currently protected by DACA. But in exchange, the Trump administration and hardliners in Congress want other concessions.\n\n\"Any solution on DACA has got to include border security, including a wall. And an end of chain migration,\" said Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia in remarks on the Senate floor last month.\n\nPerdue and President Trump want the U.S. to allow in more immigrants with desirable skills. The current policy, which they call \"chain migration,\" emphasizes family reunification. That change could have big implications for the DREAMers and their parents. Immigration hardliners worry that if the DREAMers are allowed to become citizens, their families could, too.\n\n\"This is now a mass amnesty vehicle for many that were brought here through no fault of their own,\" said R.J. Hauman, the director of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for much lower immigration levels.\n\n\"The fault has to lie somewhere, and that lies in the parents,\" Hauman said. \"And that's a huge issue of why you have to end chain migration. So these people cannot turn around and sponsor the people who actually broke the law, and who brought them here illegally.\"\n\nEven without legal status, the parents of many DACA recipients have found ways to build lives and businesses.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin D.

Olvera says his father started taking photos at birthday parties and weddings.\n\n\"He took that design creativity and started picking up photography here,\" Olvera said. \"It's something you could do freelance. And it grew into an idea. And then, with DACA it was fortified as a business.\"\n\nOlvera is helping out with that family business for now. What he really wants is to go away to college. But he feels like he can't do that.\n\n\"I'm just scared honestly of that one call saying hey, your father's been detained,\" Olvera said. \"And I'm going to blame myself for that, because I wasn't there to drive them.\"", "keywords": ["olvera", "toggle", "liles", "dreamers", "limbo", "families", "kevin", "family", "daca", "npr", "d", "parents", "debates", "immigration", "congress"], "polarity": 0.10701515151515154, "subjectivity": 0.3746666666666666},

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chair of the House intelligence committee. \"However, given the public interest in transparency in these unprecedented circumstances, the President has directed that Justice Department personnel be available to give technical assistance to the Committee, should the Committee wish to revise the February 5th Memorandum to mitigate the risks identified by the Department.\"\n\n\"The Executive Branch stands ready to review any subsequent draft of the February 5th Memorandum for declassification at the earliest opportunity,\" McGahn also wrote in the letter.\n\nThe Democratic countermemo, authored by the committee's ranking member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was drafted in response to the Nunes memo, which contends that officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI abused their authority in authorizing surveillance on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.\n\nThe Nunes memo is four pages long. People who have read the Schiff memo told NPR's Philip Ewing that it is 10 pages and contains many footnotes intended to rebut arguments made in the GOP document.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump tweeted about the back-and-forth, implying Democrats purposefully filled their memo with details that would need redaction so they could then turn around and blame him when he declined to declassify and release it as originally drafted.\n\n\"The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!\"\n\nThe House intelligence committee voted Monday to release the Democratic memo, but it was up to Trump to decide whether to declassify the information it contained and give his approval for its release as he did last week with the Nunes memo. Democrats urged him to make the memo public, and even top Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., agreed it should be released just as the Nunes memo had been.\n\nSchiff said in a statement Friday that Trump had released Nunes' \"deeply flawed and inaccurate memo\" without any redactions and despite concerns voiced by the Justice Department and the FBI. The memo \"was described by the agencies as extraordinarily reckless and omitting material facts,\" the Democrat said.\n\n\"The Democratic response sets out the material facts that were necessary for the public to see that the FBI acted properly in seeking a FISA warrant on Carter Page,\" Schiff said. \"After promising to treat the Democratic response in precisely the same way, the White House now seeks to have the Democratic memo sent back to committee and revised by the same Majority that produced the flawed Nunes document to begin with.\"\n\nSchiff said that Democrats on the committee \"will be reviewing the recommended redactions from DOJ and FBI, which these agencies shared with the White House, and look forward to conferring with the agencies to determine how we can properly inform the American people about the misleading attack on law enforcement by the GOP and address any concerns over [intelligence] sources and methods\" and that they hope the matter can be resolved \"quickly.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted Trump's decision, saying Friday that the president's \"double standard when it comes to transparency is appalling.\"\n\n\"The rationale for releasing the Nunes memo, transparency, vanishes when it could show information that's harmful to him. Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: What is he hiding?\" Schumer also said in a statement.\n\nRep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., tweeted Friday that he had seen both the Democratic and Republican memos, that neither is damaging to national security and that the Democratic response should be released.\n\nAfter the Nunes memo was released, Trump saw the document as evidence that the investigation by DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller was politically motivated.\n\n\"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their [sic] was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\" the president tweeted Feb. 3, one day after the Nunes memo was released.\n\nHowever, the Nunes memo also shows that the Justice Department and the FBI did not launch their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election because of an unverified dossier about Trump and Russia compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. Republicans have seized on the Steele dossier because he was commissioned by the political research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nInstead, it was Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and meetings he had with agents of the Kremlin at which he was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton that triggered the investigation, the Nunes memo says. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and Russian agents.\n\nTrump also seized on revelations in the Nunes memo that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved a warrant application for surveillance on Page, raising the specter that the president could fire him, triggering a potential crisis in who would oversee Mueller's investigation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the probe.\n\nThe White House has denied it is considering terminating Rosenstein. If that did happen, though, responsibility for overseeing the Mueller probe would then fall to the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand. However, Brand announced Friday she will be departing the Justice Department in the coming weeks for a job in the private sector.\n\nRosenstein met with Trump on Tuesday to talk about the countermemo and begin the declassification review.\n\nIn a letter also released Friday by the White House, Rosenstein provided justification to the White House for not releasing the Schiff memo right now, writing to McGahn that the Justice Department has identified sections of the Democratic memo \"the release of which would present such concerns in light of longstanding principles regarding the protection of intelligence sources and methods, ongoing investigations, and other similarly sensitive information,\" along with other \"information for which national security or law enforcement concerns are especially significant.\"", "keywords": ["suggests", "nunes", "committee", "trump", "memo", "immediately", "white", "release", "department", "democratic", "house", "revisions", "justice"], "polarity": 0.037759103641456584, "subjectivity": 0.3519915966386554},

A source told NPR that Brand, who was sworn in last May, has been in talks about becoming the top lawyer at Walmart.\n\nOther sources said Brand has chafed for months at the limits of her post at DOJ. President Trump has repeatedly attacked the law enforcement agency and sought to cast doubt on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nHer role at the Justice Department was doubly important because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the Russia investigation, given his role with the Trump campaign. That left Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein overseeing Mueller's investigation, and Trump and GOP allies have attacked Rosenstein at times.\n\nScrutiny of Rosenstein from conservatives allied with Trump escalated last week after a Republican memo authored by House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., detailed how Justice Department and FBI officials including Rosenstein authorized surveillance on Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who had contact with Russians.\n\nAsked last Friday after the memo's release whether he still had confidence in Rosenstein, Trump responded, \"You figure that one out,\" raising the specter he might fire the deputy attorney general. However, the White House quickly denied any plans to remove Rosenstein. But if he was let go, that would have left Brand next in line to oversee Mueller's investigation, among Rosenstein's other responsibilities.\n\n\"The men and women of the Department of Justice impress me every day,\" Brand said in a statement. \"I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish over my time here. I want to thank Attorney General Sessions for his leadership over this Department. I've seen firsthand his commitment to the rule of law and to keeping the American people safe.\"\n\nSessions also praised her work, calling her a \"lawyer's lawyer.\"\n\n\"I know the entire Department of Justice will miss her, but we join together in congratulating her on this new opportunity in the private sector. She will always remain a part of the Department of Justice family,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\nBrand is an expert in national security and helped defend the administration's efforts to renew a foreign surveillance law. But she had a relatively small staff and a portfolio of issues that focused mostly on civil litigation, civil rights and other issues. In recent months, Brand delivered speeches in the administration's fight against human trafficking.\n\nHer office oversees the Antitrust Division, the Civil Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Tax Division, the Office of Justice Programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services, the Community Relations Service, the Office of Dispute Resolution, the Office of Violence Against Women, the Office of Information and Privacy, the Executive Office for United States Trustees and the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.\n\nBrand was also a top Justice Department official in the George W.

Some are true and some are false,\" Trump posted online. \"Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused \u2014 life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\"\n\nThe Saturday morning tweet came after Trump said Friday afternoon that he was surprised and saddened by allegations of domestic violence against a top aide, Rob Porter, who resigned this week. Hours later on Friday evening, a White House speechwriter also stepped down amid accusations of domestic abuse.\n\nTrump praised Porter's work as White House staff secretary on Friday and said he hopes the former aide goes on to a successful career elsewhere.\n\n\"We wish him well,\" Trump told reporters during a hastily arranged photo opportunity in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump noted that Porter has denied the allegations of domestic abuse leveled by two of his ex-wives.\n\n\"He says he's innocent, and I think you have to remember that,\" Trump said.\n\nPolitics Week In Politics: John Kelly And Rob Porter Week In Politics: John Kelly And Rob Porter Listen \u00b7 4:01 4:01\n\nThe president used similar language in November to discuss charges of sexual misconduct against then-Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.\n\n\"He totally denies it,\" Trump said of Moore, even as other Republican leaders called for Moore to step aside. \"He says it didn't happen. And, you know, you have to listen to him.\" The White House had called the allegations \"very troubling.\"\n\nPorter resigned abruptly this week when the allegations of spousal abuse were made public, initially by the Daily Mail. A background check for security clearance was in progress at the time of his resignation.\n\nLate Friday, a second White House aide, speechwriter David Sorensen, also resigned amid allegations of domestic violence. NPR has confirmed Sorensen's departure, which was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\n\"Before we were contacted by the media, we learned last night that there were allegations,\" said principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah. \"We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\"\n\nSorensen told the Post he stepped down because he \"didn't want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\"\n\nA White House official told NPR's Tamara Keith that Sorensen's position did not require a security clearance, but that his background check was ongoing. Sorensen was a former top policy adviser to Maine GOP Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nAccording to the Post, Sorensen's ex-wife \"claimed that he was violent and emotionally abusive during their turbulent 2\u00bd -year marriage.\" However, Sorensen alleges it was his ex-wife, Jessica Corbett, who was abusive toward him.\n\nCorbett claimed that her ex-husband \"ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off Maine's coast, an incident she said left her fearing for her life.\" She also provided the Post with text messages and emails in which Sorensen berated her and showed the newspaper a photo of a scar from the alleged cigarette burn.\n\nIn a lengthy statement provided to the Post, Sorensen said he had \"never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life.\"\n\n\"In fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her,\" he added, according to the Post, also saying he had consulted with an attorney and was \" 'considering legal options to address her defamation.' \"\n\n\"Sorensen alleged that Corbett punched him on multiple occasions,\" the Post reported. \"Sorensen provided photos of what he said were injuries his ex-wife inflicted upon him during their fights, including bruises and scrapes,\" the newspaper also reported.\n\nAlso according to the Post: \"Corbett said several of the incidents involved alcohol and acknowledged that she slapped Sorensen a number of times after he called her a vulgar term.\"\n\nSorensen's departure adds to the ongoing headache for the White House and amplifies questions about how thoroughly it not only vets staff but also takes claims of domestic abuse.\n\nAt first, White House officials rallied around Porter, who described the allegations as false and \"vile claims.\" But their public support for Porter quickly evaporated once a photo surfaced showing one of his ex-wives with a black eye.\n\nBy Thursday morning, Porter had cleaned out his desk near the Oval Office, where he supervised the flow of paperwork to the president. Meanwhile, questions were swirling about how long his White House colleagues had known about the alleged abuse.\n\nTrump said he was not aware of the claims before this week's news reports.\n\n\"I found out about it recently and I was surprised by it,\" the president said. He later added that \"it was very sad when we heard about it. And certainly he's also very sad.\"\n\nOf Porter, Trump said, \"It's obviously a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House and we hope he has a wonderful career.\"\n\nThe president's praise for Porter's job performance drew a rebuke from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"That's like saying, 'That ax murderer out there, he's a great painter,' \" Biden told an audience of fraternity and sorority students in Indianapolis. \"Is there any other crime \u2014 and it's a crime \u2014 where there would be an explanation that the reason why we shouldn't pay attention to the transgression is because they're good at something?\"\n\nVice President Pence also seemed to draw a tougher line against the former staff secretary than Trump did, telling NBC's Nightly News that he was \"appalled\" by the allegations against Porter.\n\n\"There's no tolerance in this White House, and no place in America for domestic abuse,\" Pence said in an interview with Lester Holt.", "keywords": ["porter", "accused", "shattered", "trump", "lives", "white", "resigned", "domestic", "sorensen", "post", "aides", "house", "abuse", "allegations", "president", "resign"], "polarity": 0.0026842129501703895, "subjectivity": 0.36774761290718744},

Trump himself has gone back and forth since taking office about whether he accepts it even took place.\n\nAll the same, many Trump aides and advisers did have contact with Russians before and after Election Day. Two have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about that and are cooperating with investigators.\n\nAnd even though no one knows how reliable the dossier is, nobody has completely debunked it either. Democrats, in fact, are counting on that as they respond to the once-classified memo by House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\n\nThe background: Nunes argues \"biased\" officials in the FBI and Justice Department abused their surveillance powers. They did so, he charges, by relying on the dossier in asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant to surveil one of Trump's onetime advisers, Carter Page.\n\nOne problem, Nunes wrote, is that the dossier was \"minimally corroborated.\" Also, the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele, was politically biased: He told a Justice Department interlocutor that he \"was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,\" the Nunes memo says.\n\nThe response, Part 1: There's a legal thread here and a political one. First, the law.\n\nDemocrats, led by House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerrold Nadler of New York, said there was no reason for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to reject any of the material about Steele's dossier on which it was briefed.\n\nSteele was a longtime British intelligence officer known to U.S. intelligence officials and a trusted source, Nadler argued. Although the FBI or other U.S. intelligence agencies might not have been able initially to verify on their own what he reported, there also was no reason to doubt it.\n\nThe Democrats' case is designed to quash the notion that the FBI got improper or inadmissible evidence from its surveillance. Several FBI and Justice Department leaders including the current deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, signed applications to reauthorize warrants to monitor the communications of Page, who traveled to Russia at least twice in 2016.\n\nThe legal undercurrent of Nunes' contention against the FBI and DOJ is that whatever the feds collected on Page was \"fruit of a poisonous tree,\" as lawyers say, because, in this telling, the warrants were obtained improperly.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it should: Critics made a similar case against Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller in arguing he had improperly obtained emails from the time of the Trump transition. The special counsel's office defended the procedures it follows in obtaining evidence.\n\nIn the case of the FISA warrants, the judges involved apparently had no problems with the evidence either. A FISA court won't renew a surveillance warrant unless it's yielding something, so presumably there was enough evidence from the collection on Page to satisfy the secret court it made sense to keep it going.\n\nThe reponse, Part 2: The political case is easier to understand \u2014 but also riskier. First, Democrats argue that it doesn't matter that Democrats underwrote a portion of Steele's research or that Steele himself was anti-Trump: \"Nothing about the source of Steele's funding or his later opinions about Donald Trump speak to the credibility of his work, or its inclusion in the FISA application,\" as Nadler put it.\n\nIn the public square, however, that obviously does matter. Steele's paycheck was partisan, his sympathies were against Trump, and he told the Justice Department as much.\n\nSecond, Democrats argue that although we don't know that Steele's dossier is true, we also don't know that it isn't true. That may be, but it's a perilous sandbar on which to build this structure if more revelations come rolling in \u2014 as they often do in this story.\n\nRussia's campaign of \"active measures\" against the West proves broader all the time. So if it eventually turns out that some or all of what Steele wrote was in fact misinformation fed by Russia's intelligence services, or simply \"honestly\" wrong, for lack of a better term, Nadler and his compatriots will have hitched their wagon to a bad horse.\n\nThe countermemo\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., joined the defense of Steele on Friday by objecting to the \"criminal referral\" that had been submitted against him by Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who are on the committee.\n\nThe defense campaign was expected to continue Friday with another memo by the House intelligence committee's ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. It was drafted as a dedicated rebuttal to Nunes' memo. Republicans and Democrats voted without opposition on Monday to release it \u2014 but late Friday, the White House said it was blocking its release.\n\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn wrote in a letter to House leaders and Schiff that there was too much classified information in Democrats' countermemo. That was always going to be part of the game, and the question in Washington, D.C., all week had been whether Trump might block it altogether or release a highly redacted version.\n\nDemocrats cried foul. The FBI and Justice Department didn't want Nunes' memo out either, Schiff complained. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the decision exposed the White House's hypocrisy and made Trump look as though he was trying to hide something.\n\n\"The rationale for releasing the Nunes memo, transparency, vanishes when it could show information that's harmful to him,\" Schumer said. \"Millions of Americans are asking one simple question: What is he hiding?\"\n\nThe public might still get to see the countermemo in some form. McGahn wrote that if Schiff and his fellow Democrats wanted to recast it and try again, the White House said it would make Justice Department officials available to help with the edit. Schiff said House intelligence committee Democrats look forward to that work.\n\nThe big show\n\nThese are, by all public appearances, very bad times in the intelligence business.\n\nThe CIA and its siblings had warnings early on about the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election, but their response was arguably slow and uncoordinated. The FBI's ongoing problems remain front-page news. But it's even worse than that.\n\nHuman sources overseas have been killed. The National Security Agency has been rocked by leak after loss after scandal. The Defense Intelligence Agency was blindsided by North Korea's progress on its nuclear missile program. And those are only the stories that make it into the press.\n\nThere's another problem closer to home. The white-hot politics of the Russia imbroglio may have effectively ended the House intelligence committee's ability to oversee its retinue of agencies. The Republicans are walling out the Democrats. People inside the spy world are wondering whether they can trust the committee with their secrets.\n\nAgainst this rosy backdrop, the Senate intelligence committee has convened its annual hearing with the leaders of the spy agencies on Tuesday. Leading off the witness list is the seldom-seen Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and joining him will be CIA Director Mike Pompeo, FBI Director Christopher Wray and several other heavyweights.\n\nCoats and his compatriots will try desperately not to make any news beyond their boilerplate warnings about how the number of threats facing the United States is more broad and complex than ever, but the real show will start once the opening statements have concluded.\n\nThe myriad problems among the spy agencies and the inescapable Russia imbroglio will mean that eyes in the capital will be glued to C-SPAN to see what emerges next.", "keywords": ["nunes", "key", "weapon", "russia", "try", "trump", "lose", "memo", "fbi", "counterattack", "justice", "democrats", "department", "house", "investigations", "intelligence"], "polarity": 0.0013181574979327807, "subjectivity": 0.39591249574395637},

Jim Renacci.\n\n\"Jim, get in there and fight \u2014 we need you, we need you,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nA few weeks ago, White House staff personally intervened to persuade Renacci, who had been running for governor, to switch over to the Senate race to take on Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. That is because GOP front-runner Josh Mandel dropped out last month, saying his wife is dealing with health problems. The move set off a scramble since the filing deadline was this past Wednesday.\n\nOhio is just one place where Republicans have struggled to recruit high-profile candidates to take on vulnerable Democratic senators and are left with messy primaries in some key contests, forcing candidates to run to the right in some cases.\n\nThis is all despite starting the cycle with a golden 2018 Senate map \u2014 a silver lining of what could be a difficult midterm for Republicans. Democrats have to defend incumbents in 10 states Trump carried, while only one GOP senator is up for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won.\n\nBut now there at least a half-dozen states where Republicans failed to get a top-tier recruit so far or to woo their first pick into the contest.\n\nIn Ohio, where Trump won by 8 points, J.D. Vance, the author of the bestseller Hillbilly Elegy, had been reportedly courted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to run but ultimately passed. Rep. Pat Tiberi, who recently resigned early to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable, also passed on a bid, as had Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor.\n\n\"Overall, Republicans' recruiting record is decidedly mixed,\" Cook Political Report senior editor Jennifer Duffy recently wrote. \"They haven't gotten their first choices in many of the key races. In several cases, their second choices might prove to be strong candidates, but it is hard to ignore the reality that Republicans are looking at a slate of missed opportunities.\"\n\nTrump is the reason that Democrats and even some Republicans say GOP recruitment is that much harder, while Democrats have plenty of enthusiasm on their side and have had success when it comes to bringing on candidates in both House and Senate races.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Republicans have had trouble recruiting Senate candidates,\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \"They're facing a lot of headwinds in this election. One, we've got really strong incumbents who are problem-solvers and are known in their states as people who are focused on getting things done. Two, you've got a president who does an awful lot of tweeting, and these candidates don't want to have to answer for every single tweet that Donald Trump puts out.\"\n\nThat is one driving force behind the swarm of retirements in competitive House districts, too, and exiting Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said that same dynamic could be at play in the battle for the Senate, too.\n\n\"The Democrats should be in a defensive position, but because of the overall political environment, it will be challenging for Republicans to take out any Democrats, and also then to hold those few Republican seats that we need to hold the Senate,\" Dent said.\n\nBuckeye recruitment stymied\n\nMatt Borges, a former Ohio Republican Party chairman, argued that there were plenty of personal reasons for candidates in his state to pass on the race that had nothing to do with Trump.\n\n\"On the one hand, it certainly can be said that we had some marquee names that chose not to move forward,\" Borges said. \"I don't believe that any of those was predicated on the notion that Ohio is going to be unwinnable this year.\"\n\nRenacci still faces a primary against investment banker Mike Gibbons. But now he has a presidential shout-out and quasi-endorsement.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nBorges said the president can absolutely be a boon for Renacci in both the primary and the general election, pointing out that Trump's approval rating in Ohio remains much higher than it is nationally.\n\nDemocratic candidates say they know they can't solely run simply against Trump in these states. In Ohio, Brown campaign manager Justin Barasky said the plan includes highlighting areas where the Democrat has agreed with Trump, including on trade.\n\n\"You know, right after Donald Trump got into office, Sherrod reached out to him and told them that he wanted to work with him on fighting some of these bad trade deals that have cost Ohio jobs,\" Barasky said.\n\nAnd the campaign knows it can't rely solely on other voters' frustration with Trump to win re-election.\n\n\"We're certainly always paying attention to what President Trump is doing,\" Barasky added. \"But our campaign doesn't live and die by where his approval rating is.\"\n\nBut, Borges acknowledged a risk with Trump. At that Monday event where Trump was supposed to be touting the new tax law, wage growth and job gains \u2014 the message Republicans need to be laser-focused on ahead of November \u2014 the president veered off course instead and accused Democrats of \"treason\" for not standing up and applauding during his State of the Union last week. So, the headlines in the state were about that riff and not the tax bill.\n\n\"Part of that also is taking some of the good with the bad \u2014 when [Trump] comes to Ohio and does an event on a very popular issue and then has some remarks that might be good for the base or good for some ink and some headlines, but probably weren't exactly the type of message we were trying to deliver,\" Borges said.\n\nStruggles across the map for the GOP\n\nThere have been recruiting headaches for Republicans in other races, too. In North Dakota, Rep. Kevin Cramer flirted with a bid and was even wooed by the White House but eventually decided to remain in his safe House seat. There is no clear front-runner in the primary to face Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nThe same thing happened in nearby Montana. Attorney General Tim Fox seemed primed to run but ultimately decided against it. Then-Rep. Ryan Zinke was also considered a top challenger until Trump plucked him to run the Interior Department, though he has had a controversial tenure there. State Auditor Matt Rosendale has jumped in, but he leads a muddled, crowded GOP field.\n\nLoading...\n\nTop challengers haven't emerged yet in crowded primary fields in Wisconsin and Michigan either \u2014 two states where Trump scored surprise victories. In Wisconsin, Rep. Sean Duffy passed on running against Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, and in Michigan, Rep. Fred Upton decided against a challenge to Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\nMany Republicans have privately grumbled about GOP Rep. Lou Barletta's challenge to Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, too, worrying that his lackluster campaign could cost them another golden opportunity in a state Trump carried.\n\nEven in Missouri, after Rep. Ann Wagner initially passed, it seemed like the GOP had still landed a strong recruit in Attorney General Josh Hawley. But multiple reports surfaced this week that some Republicans were reaching back out to Wagner amid concerns about Hawley's fundraising and recent controversial comments. National Republicans, however, have dismissed those as baseless rumors.\n\nRepublicans, however, say their polling shows that Democrats in deep red states where Trump won by as much as 20 points remain very vulnerable, regardless of who the candidate is.\n\nIn fact, in Ohio the GOP may be better off without Mandel \u2014 who had plenty of baggage and a history of gaffes \u2014 in favor of Renacci, who has a longtime base in the Cleveland area and is independently wealthy.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have managed to expand their map with strong recruits. They have solid candidates in their pickup targets of Arizona and Nevada, while recruits in Tennessee and Texas could make those races unexpectedly competitive if there is a blue wave that develops.\n\nRepublicans look to tax law, economy to boost recruits\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, dismissed concerns about recruiting in the Buckeye State and elsewhere as a D.C. story and said the uptick in the economy and the new tax law would help boost GOP candidates come November.\n\n\"I think Washington is obsessed with the 'who's up, who's down' kind of game when you have good candidates in the race who are going to be very competitive,\" Gardner said.\n\nAs for underwhelming fundraising by their candidates, GOP operatives say that there has been some donor fatigue after failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), something they believe will be corrected in the coming year. And they say there is plenty of money from superPACs and other outside groups that can make up any difference. Once voters get to know their candidates, they'll be successful, Republicans argue.\n\nOne measure of relief may be coming for the GOP in Florida. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is weighing a Senate bid there, and his ability to heavily fund his own campaign would immediately make a challenge against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson into a marquee contest. But if Scott passes, it would be another major blow for the GOP.\n\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed.", "keywords": ["races", "key", "trump", "state", "senate", "struggle", "candidates", "ohio", "gop", "democrats", "democratic", "recruits", "republicans", "rep"], "polarity": 0.07880408145494353, "subjectivity": 0.4607071329054089},

Trump disavowed his attorney general over his recusal last year in the Russia investigation, and he has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department and the FBI as inept or politically motivated.\n\nFor his part, Sessions has tried to have it both ways. He has offered a few words of praise for his deputies at Justice, but told an audience this week that he knows there are sharp critics of his department.\n\n\"I'll be the first to acknowledge that we still have work to do,\" he said. \"Sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. We will not ignore these problems or hide our heads in the sand.\"\n\n\n\nCivil rights\n\n\n\nA few weeks into the job, Sessions rescinded guidance for schools that was designed to protect transgender students in bathrooms and locker rooms. Later, the Justice Department filed legal briefs arguing that a landmark 1964 civil rights law did not bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and sided with a cake shop owner who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.\n\nSessions switched positions in a major voting rights case in Texas, backing away from an argument that state lawmakers had intended to discriminate on the basis of race in their voter ID bill.\n\nAnd he ordered a review of the Justice Department's approach to consent decrees with errant police departments, ultimately determining that his civil rights unit will turn away from investigating patterns of excessive force and racial profiling by local law enforcement and instead focus resources on prosecuting individual police officers who break the law.\n\nLast fall, the attorney general also put an end to a collaborative reform process some police departments used to identify problems and get advice about how to fix them. In California, the state attorney general recently agreed to monitor how the San Francisco Police Department was ushering in changes recommended through the old DOJ program, since the federal government had backed off.\n\n\n\nImmigration\n\n\n\nAs a senator, Sessions became the leading voice in Congress for restrictive immigration policies. And in his post as the top federal law enforcement officer, Sessions has continued to advance those goals, often with the immense power of the executive branch behind him.\n\n\n\nThe attorney general has issued new priorities for immigration judges in an effort to reduce heavy backlogs in those courts. He has promised to hire dozens more judges and monitor their efficiency through what he describes as \"benchmarks.\" He has begun to crack down on immigrants who become naturalized citizens through fraud, moving to strip those people of their citizenship in court. And he has threatened to withhold U.S. grant dollars from \"sanctuary city\" jurisdictions that don't share information with federal immigration authorities.\n\n\n\nUnder Sessions' watch, the Justice Department also determined that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was \"an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch\" and could not be defended in a court challenge by Texas and other states.\n\n\n\nSentencing and drug policy\n\n\n\nEarly in his tenure, Sessions revoked an Obama-era memo that directed federal prosecutors to use discretion in making decisions about charges in drug cases. In its place, the attorney general ordered U.S. attorneys to charge the most serious, readily provable offense \u2014 a policy that could lead to more and longer prison terms for drug criminals.\n\nSessions also reversed course and announced that the Justice Department will continue to make use of private prison facilities, rather than phase out those contracts.\n\nLast month, Sessions withdrew a memo that set priorities for prosecutors in states where marijuana had been legalized for recreational or medical purposes. Long a foe of marijuana usage, the attorney general pointed out that the drug remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. His decision to get rid of the Obama memo, without issuing his own priorities, has created some confusion about whether the law will be enforced differently in different states.\n\nSessions explained himself at an event this week honoring former President Ronald Reagan and the people who worked for him. \"We don't think illegal drug use is 'recreation,' \" the attorney general said. \"Lax enforcement, permissive rhetoric and the media have undermined the essential need to say no to drug use \u2014 don't start.\"", "keywords": ["key", "rights", "transforms", "drug", "federal", "law", "department", "immigration", "general", "attorney", "ways", "sessions", "justice"], "polarity": 0.04850008707767329, "subjectivity": 0.43301114594218043},
{"title": "The Line Becomes a River", "url": "https://www.npr.org/books/titles/582730044/the-line-becomes-a-river", "text": "Excerpt: The Line Becomes A River\n\nAt the station I was given the keys to a transport van and told to drive out to the reservation where two quitters had been seen wandering through the streets of a small village. When I arrived it was just after dark and I noticed few signs of life as I drove past the scattered homes, scanning for disheartened crossers. In the center of the village a small adobe church stood in an empty dirt lot, and I saw that the front door had been left ajar. I parked the van and left the headlights shining on the entrance. I walked to the heavy wooden door and leaned with all my weight to push it open, causing a loud and violent scraping to rise up and echo into the dim interior.\n\nInside the church, the light from my flashlight glinted off tiny strings of tinsel hanging from the ceiling. A large piece of fabric depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe was strung across the front wall, and beneath it I saw two figures lying on a blanket that had been spread out between the pews and the altar. As I approached, a man looked up at me and squinted, holding out his hand to block the light. We were resting a little, he said. It's just that we are lost, muy desanimados. A woman huddled close to him, hiding her face. The man propped himself up on one elbow and told me that they had crossed four days ago, that their guide had left them behind on the first night when they'd failed to keep pace with the group. They were lost for days, he said, with nothing to drink but the filthy water from cattle tanks. Puede ser muy fea la frontera, I told him. The man shook his head. Pues s\u00ed, he replied, pero es a\u00fan m\u00e1s feo donde nosotros vivimos.\n\nThe man told me that they came from Morelos. My wife and I, we're just coming to find work, he said. He rubbed his eyes in silence. I have fresh water for you, I told them. At the station there's juice and crackers. The man looked at me and smiled weakly, then asked for a minute to gather their belongings. He stuffed some things into a backpack, then helped his wife to her feet. Her face was streaked with dried tears, and when she turned toward me I saw that she was pregnant. How many months are you? I asked. The woman looked away and the man answered for her. Seis meses. He smiled. My wife speaks perfect English, he said, shouldering the backpack. He stopped in front of the altar, bowing his head and making the sign of the cross. I waited at the door as he mumbled a prayer. Gracias, he whispered. Gracias.\n\nOutside I looked at their faces in the glare of my headlights. The woman seemed young. Where did you learn English? I asked. Iowa, she told me quietly. I grew up there, she said, I even got my GED. She kept her head down and avoided my gaze as she talked, glancing up only briefly at my uniformed body. Why did you leave? I asked her. She told me that she had returned to Morelos to care for her younger siblings after their mother died. In Morelos I made some money teaching English at the kindergarten, she said, I even tutored the adults in my village, people preparing for the journey north. For a few seconds she seemed proud, and then she shook her head. But the money there, it isn't enough. She glanced up at her husband. It was my idea to cross, she said. I wanted our child to have a life here, like I did.\n\nThe man took a moment to look at me in the light. Listen, he said, do you think you could bring us back to Mexico, como hermano? You could drive us down to the border, he pleaded, you could just leave us there, all\u00ed en la l\u00ednea. Like a brother. I sighed and turned my head, squinting at the darkness beyond the church. I have to bring you in, I told him. It's my job. The man took a deep breath and nodded and then climbed into the back of the transport van, holding out his arms to help his pregnant wife.\n\nI gestured at a case of water bottles on the floor. You should drink, I told them. I grabbed the metal door of the cage and paused. What are your names? I asked. The man looked at me strangely and glanced at his wife. Then, as if it were nothing, they took turns introducing themselves. I repeated their names and I told them mine. Mucho gusto, I said. They replied with polite smiles. Igualmente. I turned my head and then bolted the cage and shut the door.\n\nIn the driver's seat I turned to look at the couple through the plexiglass. The man held his wife and gently whispered to her, cradling her head. Just before I started the engine I could hear the soft sound of her sobbing. As I drove through the unmarked streets of the village, trying to find my way to the highway, I felt for a moment that I had become lost. Beyond the last house, I saw a white dog in the darkness at the edge of my headlights, staring into the night.\n\nAt the station, I sorted through their things with them, discarding perishables and sharp objects. I had them remove their belts and their shoelaces and I tagged their backpacks and handed them a claim ticket. I counted and took note of their money, in pesos and in dollars, and then handed it back to them, telling them to keep it close. Inside the processing center I filled out their voluntary return papers and entered their names into the computer. Before leaving them in their cell I wished them luck on their journey and asked them to be safe, to always think of their child.\n\nLater that night, as I sat in the transport van listening to the calls come out over the radio, I realized I had forgotten their names.", "keywords": ["village", "took", "asked", "wife", "looked", "line", "river", "told", "head", "van", "turned", "man"], "polarity": 0.03761123136123136, "subjectivity": 0.3734547859547859},

Rounds III is an associate counsel at OGE, a career civil servant who previously served in the ethics office of the Commerce Department and in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, or the JAG Corps. The White House announced Wednesday that Trump intends to nominate Rounds as OGE director for a five-year term that requires Senate confirmation.\n\nRounds \"is somebody who plays it by the book,\" said Richard Painter, the former White House ethics counsel to President George W. Bush. He hired Rounds as a deputy counsel. \"He insists that the rules be enforced, and interpreted very strictly.\"\n\nPainter added: \"I did not know whether he was a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, when I was there at the White House. He didn't consider it relevant, what his party affiliation was, and neither did I.\"\n\nRounds, if confirmed, will take charge of an agency under considerable pressure. With about 70 employees, OGE spent much of 2017 locked in conflict with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nBefore Trump took the oath as president, then-OGE Director Walter Shaub Jr. gave a speech criticizing Trump for refusing to divest himself of his hundreds of corporations. Ordinary government officials have to divest under a 1979 ethics law, but the president is exempt.\n\nShaub said Trump was setting a bad example, asking, \"Should the president hold himself to a lower standard than his own appointees?\"\n\nMore battles followed over incoming officials' conflict-of-interest issues and financial disclosures. Shaub resigned last July, and Trump named OGE general counsel David Apol as acting director.\n\nEarlier this week, Apol expressed concern about government ethics in a post on the OGE website. Citing a survey by the watchdog group Transparency International that Americans have growing concerns about wrongdoing within the government, and especially in the White House, he wrote that government employees who undermine the public trust \"need to stop.\"\n\nHe wrote, \"Nothing you could gain economically or politically could possibly justify putting our democracy at risk. These are perilous times.\"\n\nAn OGE spokeswoman said Apol and Rounds declined to comment for this story.\n\nDon Fox, a former acting director of OGE, praised Rounds' integrity, saying, \"I can't imagine any White House ever being able to pressure him into doing anything that he did not think was legal, appropriate or in the best interests of the country.\"\n\nShaub and Fox said they brought Rounds to OGE at the end of the Bush administration. Shaub told CNN: \"He's a solid guy. He's a decent human being.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., repeatedly objected to a Senate vote in order to air his grievances over what he calls runaway federal spending.\n\nPaul faced off with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate majority whip, just after 10 p.m. on the Senate floor and blocked multiple attempts by Cornyn to hold a vote on funding legislation before 1 a.m. Friday.\n\nEven apart from that, Republicans and Democrats are still at odds over spending levels and immigration in the bipartisan budget agreement, and while the bill is likely to pass the Senate, its future in the House remains in limbo.\n\nGiven Paul's objections, the Senate is not set to vote on the spending compromise until roughly 3 a.m. Friday. And the House is set to vote somewhere between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., according to guidance from the House majority whip's office.\n\nOptimism about the $300 billion, two-year budget agreement began to falter earlier Thursday as some House Democrats threatened to vote against the bill because it does not address immigration. Some conservatives are also threatening to vote against the measure because it would increase spending and add billions to the deficit.\n\nSenate leaders had hoped to pass the bill early in the day but were forced to wait after Paul objected to the plan. The Kentucky Republican said Thursday evening he planned to force the Senate to wait until the early hours of Friday morning \u2014 after the midnight deadline when funding expires \u2014 when debate time would expire and the Senate would be allowed to override his objection.\n\n\"I'm not advocating for shutting down the government,\" Paul said in an interview on Fox News. \"I'm also not advocating for keeping the damn thing open and borrowing a million dollars a minute.\"\n\nPaul took to the Senate floor Thursday evening, armed with charts and graphs that pointed to what he says is wasteful government spending.\n\n\"I just can't, in all honestly, look the other way just because my party is now complicit in the deficits,\" Paul said.\n\nNevertheless, separate concerns grew in the House as his protest wore on.\n\nA growing number of House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, are threatening to vote against the bill, raising concerns that House leaders may not have the votes to pass the spending bill in that chamber.\n\nPolitics Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley Says He Won't Vote For Senate Spending Proposal Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley Says He Won't Vote For Senate Spending Proposal Listen \u00b7 4:21 4:21\n\n\"We cannot allow our success in one part of the discussion to diminish our leverage in another,\" Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats. \"Speaker Ryan's refusal to allow a bipartisan process for a DACA proposal demeans the dignity of the House of Representatives. It is also an insult to the American people, who overwhelmingly support the Dreamers.\"\n\nJoe Crowley, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in an interview on All Things Considered Thursday that he also wouldn't vote for the current budget agreement because it doesn't reflect his party's values. Republicans, he said, should be doing more to make overtures to Democrats if they need their votes to keep the government open.\n\n\"What I am suggesting is they control the House, the Senate and the presidency. I don't know why, for crying out loud; why they can't actually govern, is beyond me,\" Crowley lamented. \"And the notional idea to blame Democrats in the House when they have the Oval and the majority \u2014 it's really incumbent upon them to pass their budget. It's not our responsibility to do that. It's the responsibility of the governing party to do that, and they have failed miserably. We've gone from week to week, or month to month with continuing [resolutions] and that's no way to govern.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have always expected that they would need some Democrats to help pass the spending bill, and the growing revolt has sparked serious anxiety that the spending agreement could fail, especially since House Republican leadership appears unsure how many Republicans will vote for the bill. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus already announced that their roughly 30 members will vote against the pact.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a member of that fiscally conservative caucus, told All Things Considered Thursday that he is not confident the House has the votes to pass the spending bill and hopes enough House Republicans will oppose the idea \"that we're going to spend away our future.\"\n\nPolitics Republican Rep. Mo Brooks Says Americans Can't Afford Latest Spending Bill Republican Rep. Mo Brooks Says Americans Can't Afford Latest Spending Bill Listen \u00b7 3:59 3:59\n\n\"The problem is the American people have elected so many debt junkies that they're ecstatic with borrowing money today so they can get elected tomorrow [without] worrying about someone paying for it after the elections,\" Brooks said. \"And that's very unfortunate that so many people are putting their self-interest, their elections before their country.\"\n\nThe two factions are angry about dramatically different issues but their combined frustration could be enough to make sure the bill can't pass.\n\nHouse Democrats huddled for more than an hour Thursday night to decide how they should vote. Members emerged conflicted.\n\nHouse Democrats are particularly worried that they will lose any leverage on immigration once a spending bill is enacted. Spending bills are among the few areas where Republicans need Democratic votes in the House. Pelosi and other top Democrats say they want to force Republicans to agree to legal protections for DREAMers, including the roughly 700,000 immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally after being brought to the country as children and who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nDemocrats decided to take advantage of that leverage and merge immigration talks and spending negotiations after President Trump last September announced his plan to wind down DACA. The program ends on March 5 according to terms set by the administration but is the subject of litigation in the federal courts.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., says Democrats' power would disappear if the budget bill passes because it would lift the spending pressure created by mandatory budget caps that have forced Congress to revisit spending fights since the caps were enacted in 2011.\n\n\"Once you've lifted the caps and you've done this, do you really believe that anybody is going to take us seriously?\" Gutierrez asked reporters. \"They have decoupled the budgetary process from anything where we needed leverage.\"\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus officially announced its opposition to the budget bill, with the group urging members to vote against the measure in a statement released Thursday evening.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\"CHC cannot support this budget caps bill that leaves Dreamers behind,\" they said. \"We stand with nearly 90% of Americans that agree Dreamers should be protected.\"\n\nAn official with the White House's Office of Management and Budget told NPR that OMB is currently preparing for a lapse in appropriations funding for the government. The official also urged Congress to send the funding bill to the president's desk \"without delay.\"\n\nThe deal was announced Wednesday as a bipartisan breakthrough that could free Congress from an endless cycle of spending fights.\n\nThe agreement was negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to increase military and domestic spending for two years.\n\nUnder the pact, the Pentagon would get an additional $80 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $85 billion in fiscal year 2019, while domestic spending would grow by $63 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $68 billion the following fiscal year.\n\n\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground,\" McConnell said in a speech announcing the deal.\n\nSchumer echoed the support, saying the agreement would give the federal government certainty after years of bickering.\n\n\"This budget deal is a genuine breakthrough,\" Schumer said, adding the agreement would \"break the long cycle of spending crises.\"\n\nThe agreement also has the support of the White House, where press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised the plan to hike military spending.\n\n\"This deal achieves our top priority, a much needed increase in funding for our national defense,\" Sanders said Wednesday. \"The bottom line is that, thanks to President Trump, we can now have the strongest military we have ever had.\"", "keywords": ["budget", "rand", "paul", "midnight", "lapse", "path", "funding", "bill", "agreement", "republicans", "senate", "puts", "temporary", "vote", "democrats", "house", "spending", "pass"], "polarity": 0.035950491307634176, "subjectivity": 0.42773526077097507},

But would they let something out that embarrasses Trump? Could the administration redact portions of the memo without being accused of a political cover-up? And might deferring key decisions about the memo to the FBI and Justice Department help Trump politically?\n\nComplicating matters: If the first memo was relatively straightforward, people on the inside say the second one is not.\n\n\"My initial cut is this one is a lot less clean,\" White House chief of staff John Kelly told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"At the end of it all it will be guys like [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein, [Director] Chris Wray from FBI, certainly the national security attorneys at the White House, giving the president a recommendation on it,\" Kelly also said.\n\nThe actual document is still secret, but based on descriptions from people who have read it, the Democrats' memo uses more pages \u2014 10 as compared to Republicans' 4 \u2014 and many more footnotes to respond to the initial case made by the House intelligence committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\n\nNunes' memo charges that politically biased officials in the FBI and Justice Department abused their surveillance powers in asking for a warrant to monitor the communications of a onetime Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, Carter Page.\n\nThe memo supports a narrative that calls the FBI's Russia investigation scurrilous and part of a \"deep-state\" conspiracy out to get the president.\n\nHouse intelligence committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., responded to those charges in the Democrats' countermemo. Republicans used their majority to withhold Schiff's memo at the time they voted to release the Nunes memo, which eventually appeared last Friday.\n\nThis week, the panel agreed to greenlight the release of the Democratic response, starting the review process that continues now.\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department deny they have done anything wrong.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rosenstein met with Trump on Tuesday, the White House said, to talk about the countermemo and take aboard the declassification review.\n\nTrump and his administration ultimately remain in charge of selecting what from their opponents' memo becomes public and what does not. Nunes' allies complained this week to CNN that Schiff had deliberately drafted the countermemo with so much secret information that it obviously would have to be redacted.\n\nThat could set the stage for Democrats to accuse Trump of abandoning the White House's earlier support for transparency and, specifically, of hiding things to protect the president in the Russia matter. Administration officials must decide whether they're willing to play that game.\n\nOne reason they might not: Schiff has access to the same kind of official secrets as Nunes. If he documented that, for example, other Trump campaign associates besides Page were under surveillance, with none of the complicating factors that gave rise to Nunes' complaint, the president might not want that information to be public.\n\nOne reason the White House might play ball: Trump and his allies in Congress have laid groundwork for months about the conspiracies they say are swirling within the FBI and Justice Department. Now that Trump and Kelly have said they're pushing decisions about releasing the memo to Rosenstein and Wray, the administration could try to tie them closer to the partisan attacks by Democrats \u2014 and have more \"evidence\" of what they call bias.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that the FBI's Russia investigation is a \"politically motivated witch hunt\" and the Nunes' memo details \"vindicated\" those criticisms by Trump.\n\nThe House intelligence committee's Democrats say that making partisan targets of the FBI and DoJ damages those institutions.\n\n\"It is tragic, if all too predictable, that this president would allow the release of the memo despite FBI and DOJ's expressions of 'grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the [Republicans'] memo's accuracy',\" the Democratic minority said.\n\n\"But most destructive of all may be the announcement by Chairman Nunes that he has placed the FBI and DOJ under investigation, impugning and impairing the work of the dedicated professionals trying to keep our country safe,\" the Democratic lawmakers added.\n\nIt isn't clear yet how much of the Democrats' countermemo might become public or when, but Kelly said that he expected an answer by the end of the day on Thursday.\n\nThen, he said, \"We'll go in and brief the president on it and just like we did the first time, give him a recommendation as to what he should do going forward.\"\n\nNPR correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["nunes", "need", "countermemo", "memo", "trump", "waiting", "white", "fbi", "know", "say", "democrats", "house", "president", "mania"], "polarity": 0.039247921390778547, "subjectivity": 0.36912320483749034},

It was 6:15, and LBJ was only in the sixth full day of his presidency. \"Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor,\" he began. \"All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget.

Dozens of LBJ's former colleagues from Dixie sat in stone-cold silence as Johnson affirmed to stirring applause that \"no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.\"\n\nNow, on Thanksgiving, Johnson doubled down, asking his countrymen to join him in prayer \"for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins\u2014for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. All of us, not just some of us, are His children.\"\n\nFor most Americans, Thanksgiving week marked the start of the holiday season. For Lyndon Johnson, it signaled the beginning of an intense, yearlong sprint to prove that he could break the logjam, achieve the New Frontier, and surpass it beyond even the wildest expectations of John Kennedy's supporters. It would be no easy lift.\n\n\"I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress,\" Kennedy remarked roughly a year before his death. For well over two decades, a coalition of conservative southern Democrats and northern Republicans had stymied the expansion of domestic policies first established during the New Deal era. In the Senate, an institution that the journalist William White once dubbed \"the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,\" conservatives made frequent use of the filibuster to prevent social welfare and civil rights legislation from coming to a vote, while in the House powerful southerners kept such measures forever bottled up in committee. Now, in a sharp rebuke to Kennedy's promise of dynamic action and national rejuvenation, the conservative coalition had all but ground the government to a halt. Not only did the House and the Senate refuse to take up key New Frontier measures. They also refused to pass eight of twelve routine appropriations bills, thus leaving whole parts of the government unfunded and operating on a continuing resolution that set spending at the previous year's levels.\n\nCongressional Quarterly deemed the state of affairs \"unprecedented,\" while Walter Lippmann, the dean of American journalism, bemoaned the \"scandal of drift and inefficiency\" that had beset Washington. \"This Congress has gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and decision by delay and stultification. This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave danger to the Republic.\" Yet as Harry Truman famously asserted, the buck stopped with the president. A week before Kennedy's assassination, the columnist James Reston noted \"a vague feeling of doubt and disappointment about President Kennedy's first term. . . . He has touched the intellect of the country, but not its heart. He has informed but not inspired the nation. He is the most popular figure, but he has been lucky in his competition. . . . [H]is problem is probably not how to get elected but how to govern.\"\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when Lyndon Johnson entered the White House.\n\nLBJ first came to Washington as a young congressional staff member in the early 1930s before returning to Texas in 1935 to serve as state director of the National Youth Administration (NYA), a marquee New Deal jobs project. Two years later, and against all odds, he won a special election to Congress at age twenty-eight. An ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson established a more liberal voting record than most southern Democrats with whom he served in the House. Though he consistently opposed legislation to abolish the poll tax and to make lynching a federal crime, he joined northern Democrats in supporting expanded rights for organized labor, greater administrative oversight of business and industry, and funding for public works. Notably, he continued to do so long after most of his southern Democratic colleagues forged an informal alliance with northern Republicans to oppose the Roosevelt administration. On the strength of his New Deal credentials, FDR strongly backed Johnson in a special election to fill an unexpired Senate seat in 1941. LBJ most likely won the primary (in Texas, as throughout the South, the only vote that mattered), but party rivals stole it from him in a brazen display of election-night ballot fraud. Though in the coming years he aligned himself more closely with his state's oil and gas interests, when he ran a second time for the Senate in 1948, Johnson was once again recognized as the liberal option. After achieving a razor-thin primary victory over the conservative former governor Coke Stevenson-this time, it was likely LBJs allies who stole the election-Johnson drifted rightward during his two terms in the Senate, in part out of recognition that Texas was moving strongly in that direction and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia. Johnson delivered his maiden floor speech in opposition to civil rights, turned against former New Deal allies who now stood accused of communist loyalty, and, in his time as Democratic leader after 1953, cooperated closely with the Eisenhower administration. Many of the liberals in his caucus came to despise LBJ, particularly after he neutered their civil rights bill in 1957. They correctly perceived that he wanted to pass a weak bill in order to make his prospective presidential candidacy in 1960 palatable to northern Democrats but unobjectionable to his fellow southerners. On the day that he assumed office, very few people knew what to make of Lyndon Johnson. Was he simply a pragmatist who, deep in his heart, remained an ardent New Dealer? Or was he a southern conservative who would betray John Kennedy's unfinished legacy?\n\nIf Johnson's belief system was a matter of wide speculation, few observers doubted his keen understanding of Congress. LBJ knew that conservative Democrats, in loose cooperation with Republicans, had willfully manufactured a bottleneck of important legislation to form a bulwark against Kennedy's civil rights bill. Only when liberals capitulated and withdrew the Civil Rights Act would southern Democrats consent to bring Kennedy's tax stimulus to a vote and fund the many government initiatives-including bridges, highways, post offices, and defense projects-that their more liberal and moderate colleagues hoped to deliver to hometown constituents. Johnson knew the playbook because, as a freshman senator, he had helped to write it. As long as conservatives could hold the government hostage, much as they had in 1949, when they successfully fought back Harry Truman's civil rights agenda, they could forestall consideration of Kennedy's New Frontier agenda, including civil rights legislation that lay dying on the Hill.\n\nIt took LBJ less than a day to spring into action. In a series of phone calls before and after Thanksgiving 1963, the new president highlighted the imperative of using his political capital to clear the logjam; then, and only then, would members of Congress feel at liberty to bring civil rights and other New Frontier measures to a vote. In the meantime, however, he would keep up the pressure. On Saturday, November 30\u2014just over a week after assuming the presidency\u2014LBJ asked the former Treasury secretary Robert Anderson, a Republican and outspoken fiscal conservative, to intervene with Howard Smith, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which had broad authority to prevent legislation from proceeding to the House floor. Johnson reminded Anderson that \"this country is not in any condition to take that kind of stuff . . . and that's going to hurt our people. And it's going to hurt the conservatives.\" Anderson agreed to speak with Smith and to convey the president's willingness to support a seldom-used measure\u2014a discharge petition\u2014to bypass Smith's committee altogether and bring the legislation directly to the full House.\n\nPlaying the other side just as artfully, Johnson placed a call to Dave McDonald, the president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and a member in good standing of the liberal coalition. \"They've got to petition it out,\" the president instructed. \"That means we got to get 219. We'll start at about 150 Democrats; that means we got to get 60, 70 Republicans.\" The president spoke with the passion of a true believer (\"we've been talking about this for 100 years. And they won't give us a hearing on this thing, so we got to do something about it\") and implored McDonald to fire up his union's formidable lobbying operation\u2014not only to support the discharge petition in the House, but also to move the tax and appropriations bills through committee.\n\nBefore and after the Thanksgiving holiday, Johnson repeated these conversations time and again, at once lining up support for a discharge petition in the House while affirming the need to clear the logjam of tax and spending bills before making a final push on civil rights in the Senate. Among those who understood the president's strategy was Senator George Smathers, a conservative Democrat from Florida who ultimately opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but who represented a faction of the southern caucus that was disinclined to grind all government to a halt indefinitely over civil rights. The \"sooner we can get a civil rights bill over with,\" he told Johnson, \"get that part of it ended and out of the way, the better off the South's going to be, and the better off the North's going to be, and the better off everybody's going to be. And they wouldn't hide behind the tax bill\u2014and hide behind a lot of other bills, just on the pretense of being against them when the real fact is they're against the civil rights bill.\"\n\nWithout prompting\u2014and without the knowledge that LBJ had been making a similar case to his economic advisers for several days\u2014Smathers suggested that the president make a concerted effort to woo Harry F. Byrd, the deeply conservative chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. If Johnson were willing to indulge Byrd's obsession with fiscal discipline and bring the 1964-1965 federal budget under $100 billion, then the chairman might allow the tax cut to clear through his committee. \"Wish you'd feel Byrd out,\" LBJ agreed, \"and give me a pretty good, full report.\" Unknowingly, George Smathers would help set in motion a chain of events whose consequences would be far reaching.\n\nThe strategy that Lyndon Johnson developed in the first week of his presidency had a profound but highly calculated effect. The pressure that his supporters placed on Howard Smith\u2014and the chairman's realization that a discharge petition, if successful, would permanently undermine his authority\u2014persuaded the cantankerous Virginian to allow the Civil Rights Act to reach the House floor. Beginning with outreach from Smathers, LBJ simultaneously courted Harry Byrd until the patrician senator effectively agreed to swap budget cuts for a tax stimulus. With major economic legislation now cleared through Congress, the president had paved the way for passage of long-awaited civil rights legislation.\n\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday, some of Johnson's advisers cautioned him that presidents should not spend valuable capital on hopeless causes. \"Well,\" he purportedly replied, \"what the hell's the presidency for?\"\n\nLBJ ultimately brought his budget under $100 billion, pushed Kennedy's tax cut through Congress, and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act-all by late June 1964. He accomplished these measures while also declaring an \"unconditional war on poverty\" and creating the blueprint for the Great Society\u2014the most ambitious domestic agenda since the New Deal. Though LBJ's early success owed in part to his mastery of legislative strategy, equally fundamental were efforts by advocacy groups-religious and lay alike-on behalf of civil rights and social justice legislation. Above all, Johnson benefited from a deep well of public support in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. The president's approval ratings, which fluctuated between 70 percent and 77 percent throughout the spring, owed at least as much to the country's determination to lock arms with its new leader as to LBJ's policy and political triumphs.\n\nUnlike most of his predecessors, LBJ did not enjoy the benefit of a transition period to build the team that would help him, in turn, build his vision. Instead, he had little choice but to improvise on the spot\u2014to pull a trusted friend like Jack Valenti along with him to the White House or entreat old hands from his House and Senate days to join him on a new and unfamiliar journey. These handicaps notwithstanding, in that first year of seemingly unrestrained activity and accomplishment\u2014from the time of Kennedy's death to his own election to the presidency in late 1964\u2014Johnson assembled an ad hoc staff that defied the expectations of even the most cynical Washington hands. They were a \"coalition government\" of Kennedy and Johnson men\u2014a \"strange amalgam of Austin and Boston, of cool, brainy Easterners and shrewd, folksy Texans, of men who had always been fiercely loyal to him and men who had fought and belittled him before the 1960 Los Angeles Democratic convention,\" according to Charles Roberts, who covered the White House for Newsweek. \"It is some kind of tribute to Isaiah and the LBJ Way that the transition went as smoothly as it did.\"", "keywords": ["johnson", "civil", "legislation", "tax", "rights", "senate", "kennedys", "society", "house", "president", "lbj", "great", "building"], "polarity": 0.15173983379725015, "subjectivity": 0.46541957112531274},

We do see it, and you need to stop.\"\n\nA new poll shows that a clear majority of Americans believe Russia will try to meddle in the next U.S. election. But Tillerson also noted that Russia's tactics for interfering in U.S. politics are constantly changing. A bipartisan effort is shedding new light on how Russian methods evolve.\n\nHamilton 68 is a project that has been tracking Russian influence networks on Twitter for more than six months, watching as Kremlin-linked bots and social media amplifiers seek to inject themselves into national controversies, like #ReleaseTheMemo, the Charlottesville white nationalist rally and the NFL kneeling controversy.\n\nBots are automated accounts that repeatedly churn out tweets. They can be used to support a narrative or retweet other messages to falsely amplify a message.\n\nThis project has identified and monitors 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations and continuously updates the results through an online dashboard. The tracking effort is part of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nAfter more than half a year of tracking Russian influence on Twitter, the project's staff members have seen deeper trends that reveal how the Russian government tries to get its own message out to more Americans. In addition to fanning controversies, Hamilton 68 noticed that the bots are trying to expand American exposure to Russian foreign policy propaganda, in part by slipping it into innocuous conversations.\n\nAmplifying #ReleaseTheMemo and #TakeAKnee\n\nThe bread and butter of Russia information operations remains an effort to divide Americans. Russian bots weren't commenting on the NFL, Charlottesville or DACA because they had a stake in the outcome of the political debate, according to those tracking the activity.\n\n\"These are not networks that are necessarily always traditional propaganda. ... A lot of it is just trying to rip apart Americans, to sow chaos within our political system, to pit Americans of both parties against each other,\" said Jamie Fly, a director for the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former foreign policy aide for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \"And so a lot of the issues that we see these networks push are actually part of our day-to-day domestic political debates and often have nothing to do with foreign policy.\"\n\nThere has also been a massive increase in the amount of chatter that promotes mistrust of American institutions, especially the idea of an American \"deep state,\" the idea that there is a conspiracy of government officials working to undercut the president.\n\nThe deep state narrative was the focus of between 5 and 10 percent of the weekly content on the Russia-linked influence network in October, when Hamilton 68 began its tracking. Last week, it represented 38 percent of the articles linked to by those accounts.\n\n\"That's gone from being a sort-of ripple beneath the surface to now that's risen up to where it's typically the top thing we're seeing week to week,\" said Bret Schafer, the analyst for the project who updates the dashboard each day.\n\nRecruiting eyeballs for Russian propaganda\n\nLooking a little deeper, the Russian influence networks are using intriguing techniques to amplify their reach and change the types of content that Americans read.\n\n\"If you look at the dashboard day to day, it tends to follow the topic du jour that's in the general news cycle. So you'll see conversations about DACA or 'release the memo' or NFL protests, so you get caught at looking at the granular level and lose focus of the big-picture narratives,\" Schafer said. \"But when you zoom out and look at what's happened over the past six months, you start seeing some patterns start to emerge.\"\n\nOftentimes bots will begin tweeting about totally innocent topics, such as a sporting event or a trending Twitter topic, as a means for expanding their audience.\n\nSchafer said he noticed the trend when he saw a number of their monitored accounts start tweeting about #MondayMotivation and #WednesdayWisdom, popular hashtags used by many American Twitter users, mixed in with content about Syria and Ukraine that Russian bots frequently discuss in defense of Russia's interventions in those countries.\n\n\"We look at that as being the recruitment topic,\" Schafer told NPR. \"If they started shouting about Syria and Ukraine ... less people would see it, and it would be less effective.\"\n\nStill searching for solutions\n\nStill, the bots don't have a unified partisan slant, even though U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian influence operations were aimed at supporting President Trump in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"The reality is that they also turn against Republicans,\" Fly said. \"They have gone after administration officials like [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster. They've attacked [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell. They've attacked Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, [Jeff] Flake, Sen. [John] McCain on a regular basis. No one in American politics is immune from the reach of these networks.\"\n\nAnd so this is why Fly has teamed up with Laura Rosenberger, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during the 2016 presidential campaign. Together, they're co-directors for the Alliance for Securing Democracy's efforts to track and push back against Russian meddling in the American political system.\n\n\"The bipartisan aspect of what we're doing is actually strategically important,\" Rosenberger said, pointing to the apparent Russian goal of increasing political division.\n\nEven on Capitol Hill, where bipartisanship is the exception rather than the rule, there's a bipartisan understanding that Russia meddled in the American political process during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRosenberger pointed to the \"nearly unanimous\" vote in Congress to impose sanctions on Russia as evidence, although the White House recently said it will not implement Russia-related sanctions that Congress required because it was not necessary at this point.\n\nStill, those on both sides of the aisle understand that there has been no letup.\n\n\"The Russian effort to undermine our democracy did not end with Election Day in 2016 \u2014 these tools, whether creation of fake accounts, or the use of automated bots, continues on an ongoing basis,\" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told NPR.\n\n\"This is not just an elections issue,\" added Fly, the former Rubio aide. \"The reality is that Russian interference never stopped.\"\n\nBut even Warner, who has a front row seat at briefings by the intelligence community, acknowledges that there are as yet no clear legislative answers for how to address Russian influence operations on social media networks.\n\nHe has proposed legislation that requires social media networks to disclose the source of paid political ads. But he admits that represents a small part of how Russia influences the American political debate \u2014 and puts the onus on tech companies to disrupt automated bots.\n\n\"This is really an ongoing national security issue, and I don't think we have come up with a legislative or policy solution yet that fully gets it right,\" Warner said. \"The social media companies really need to work in partnership with us in a way that we get this right, that people can know if an account is being manipulated by a foreign entity. And if it's being pushed by automated bots, I think a user has the right to know that information.\"", "keywords": ["bots", "russian", "meddling", "russia", "networks", "midterms", "tracking", "political", "shows", "2018", "twitter", "ahead", "efforts", "american", "influence", "americans", "evolving"], "polarity": 0.07640740527908668, "subjectivity": 0.28939371837601924},

But now things are out in the open and I have to speak plainly, at least to my travel agent. \"I want to go to Maiduguri,\" I say, as nonchalantly as possible.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Maiduguri in Nigeria,\" I say, hoping faintly that the poor phone connection is the reason for her question.\n\n\"You're not serious, are you?\"\n\nSabine, the owner of the little agency in Munich, is used to me by now. She's been booking my flights for years. And they have regularly taken me, as a journalist and an expert on Muslim terrorism and victim traumatization, to troubled regions of the world that no one would normally visit if they didn't have to. Sabine has organized my frequent trips to Afghanistan, Iraq or Africa without batting an eyelid. But she's unhappy about today's request.\n\n\"Maiduguri airport's been bombed,\" she informs me. \"As far as I know nobody flies there anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" I didn't know that. \"Is there a northbound bus connection?\"\n\n\"Are you crazy? It's about six hundred miles away from Abuja. And anyway ...\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" I cut in. Sabine doesn't need to say any more. It would be too dangerous to drive through Nigeria by car. The A13, the main connection with the northern cities of the state of Borno, also lies on the road on which the terrorist group Boko Haram is active. It leads straight by the notorious Sambisa Forest. This swampland is where they have been holding the schoolgirls they abducted from Chibok, nearly seventy miles south of Maiduguri, in the spring of 2014, in an act that brought the terrorist militia into the world's eye. Michelle Obama, then the First Lady of the USA, put herself at the head of the \"Bring Back Our Girls\" movement, with which parents are trying to free their children from the clutches of the terrorists. Am I going to have to forget my travel plans?\n\n\"Let me just check,\" Sabine says. I hear her keyboard clicking. \"Hm, you might be in luck: the Nigerian company Medview recently started flying into Maiduguri again, but quite irregularly. The flight might be canceled or postponed at short notice if the security situation gets worse.\"\n\n\"OK, great!\" I hear myself saying. \"Can you book them from here?\"\n\n\"I can try.\" More clicking at the other end. \"It seems to be working,\" Sabine says. \"Do you want me to book it? Or just reserve it for now?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say firmly. I've been dithering for long enough. For over a year I've been considering traveling to northern Nigeria. Since the Islamists of the Boko Haram sect in the north of the country began wreaking their havoc, and particularly since the kidnap of the Chibok schoolgirls, I've thought more and more about interviewing the female victims of the terrorist group. For a foreigner, and a white- skinned woman, such a journey is an incredibly risky undertaking. But recently I've found someone who knows the area to come with me: I can travel with Renate Ellmenreich, a retired Protestant vicar who lived there as a missionary years ago, and who still has good connections.\n\n\"I'm quite sure,\" I say to Sabine. \"Book two tickets for me.\"\n\n\n\nAbout a month before this I met Renate for the first time at Berlin's Central Station. Even though we'd only previously spoken on the phone, I recognized her straightaway. She was wearing a tweed jacket and a huge pair of purple sunglasses. The sixty-five-year-old strode energetically toward me, her freshly blow- dried pageboy cut bouncing in rhythm. \"I'm Renate,\" she said in her sonorous vicar's voice.\n\nWhen we're sitting in a caf\u00e9 a few minutes later she tells me about her time in Nigeria. Around the turn of the millennium she and her husband were sent there by the mission in Basle. Renate was assigned to the station in Gavva, a small town at the foot of the Mandara Mountains, seventy kilometers southwest of Maiduguri. Her husband, Gunnar, took a similar job in Mubi, a little further to the south.\n\nWith a pencil, Renate does me a quick sketch of the area on a paper napkin. \"Gavva's here,\" she explains, and draws a rectangle toward the top left-hand side of the district. \"And this is the Sambisa Forest, about ten miles away as the crow flies.\" I'm startled by the small distance between the two places. Renate's chosen home in Africa is in the middle of the territory where the Islamic sect is terrorizing the population.\n\n\"We would never have expected anything like this,\" admits Renate, who was doing Christian development work. \"Even then there were sporadic tensions between the Christians and the Muslims. But terrorism, and on this scale, was completely unimaginable.\"\n\nAt that moment a group of football fans drifts past us, shouting, waving the red and white flags that identify them as Bayern Munich supporters, and roaring their slogans. We have to interrupt our conversation. But Renate just smiles mildly. \"Football is mostly harmless,\" she says. \"But it's a different story if you give those young men a gun. In Nigeria, sadly, there are far too many men with guns. And it's always the women who pay in the end.\"\n\nRenate lost her husband in Nigeria back then. He died in 2004 of a brief but violent fever, caused by a tropical virus. After that she set up an aid organization for widows. Now that organization looks after women victims of Boko Haram terrorism. \"I urgently need to get back to Maiduguri to find out what the women there need most urgently,\" she tells me, deeply concerned.\n\n\"Then let's go together,\" I suggest. The fact that Renate has a local infrastructure of private contacts also brings the journey into the realms of the feasible as far as I'm concerned. \"We can depend on your people there, can't we?\"\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" she says, without hesitation. \"But let's be clear about one thing: churches and vicars are high on the list of the terrorists' targets. And foreign journalists come next.\"\n\nEven though I knew that, of course, Renate's words from our first conversation go on echoing in my head for a long time. But they won't put me off. Now we both have our tickets and our visas. She's given me precise instructions about what I need to pack: nuts, dried fruit, muesli bars, multivitamin tablets, protein shakes, bedsheets, towels, disinfectant spray, bandages, antibiotics, a mosquito net and \u2014 very important \u2014 instant coffee for our breakfast.\n\nThe food supply situation in the northeast of Nigeria is extremely poor. Since Boko Haram occupied large stretches of the terrain in 2014, the farmers haven't been able to work their fields, and harvests have failed. Food from the rich south comes to the north very rarely. First of all because there are road blocks and many attacks on transports. And also because there are hardly any solvent customers in the corrugated- iron metropolis of Maiduguri. The city is full of refugees who depend on government handouts.\n\nIn November 2015 we meet at Frankfurt airport. I've just come from Berlin, and as always I've allowed a very short transfer time. Breathlessly I dash into the departure lounge and look out for Renate. She hobbles toward me on crutches. She sprained her ankle the previous day. But clearly it didn't occur to her to cancel the trip. \"The swelling's already going down,\" she reassures me, and cheerfully waves her crutches in the air. \"I don't really need these things. But somebody in Nigeria is bound to have a use for them.\"\n\nI grin. Now I'm quite sure that Renate's exactly the right traveling companion for me.\n\nIt takes our Lufthansa plane only six hours to get to Abuja, the seat of government and the second largest city in Nigeria. We get there at four o'clock in the afternoon local time. Hard to believe there is not even a time difference with Germany.\n\nI step onto the escalator behind Renate and her crutches, and crash into a wall of tropical heat and high humidity. In the hall with the luggage carousels helpers run about busily to take our luggage outside on their trolleys in exchange for a few cents. They make an enormous racket. The only problem is: Renate's suitcase hasn't arrived. The big one, stuffed with the things that she needs for the job-finding workshops that she wants to do with the women in Maiduguri. Now we lack both the ingredients for soap production and the molds for muffin baking; these two skills were intended to enable the women to earn some money. Renate is in despair. \"I can't travel on without my suitcase,\" she tells me.\n\nWe hastily fill out a series of very complicated forms to report the loss. A young woman in a pretty straight-hair wig is very helpful to us. \"You might get your suitcase tomorrow, ma'am,\" she says, looking as if she doesn't believe it herself. \"If you like, I can keep your claim slip and pursue the matter for you at the airport. Just write your phone number on it.\"\n\n\"My phone number?\" Renate thinks for a moment. \"Yes, OK.\" She writes down the phone number of her German friend Annegret, who lives on a farm near Abuja. We will spend the first night at her place. The sixty-year-old South German is waiting for us in the arrivals hall.\n\nA little later we are sitting in Annegret's rickety Fiat. It's already getting dark. The road to the farm is quite heavily used. It leads through several small villages whose centers are recognizable by the gatherings of people and the proliferation of stalls. They are selling groceries, warm food and all kinds of paraphernalia. We buy a SIM card for Renate's phone. Then we turn on to a gravel track. From now on there are no villages; the bush used as pasture by the Fulani nomads stretches out on either side of the road.\n\nNigeria's population consists of a great variety of ethnic groups who speak a total of 514 different languages. The Fulani and Hausa in the north, who constitute about a third of the population, are among the biggest and most politically influential. They are Muslim. The south is dominated by the Christian Yoruba and Igbo, who each constitute about 20 percent of the overall population. About 180 million people in all live in Nigeria. Around half of them are Muslims, 45 percent Christian, the rest follow traditional African religions. In many places, however, widespread animist thinking mixes with the ideas of other religions.\n\nWe reach a grove of palm trees \u2014 and the road becomes even bumpier. Annegret skilfully drives around the potholes. When she stops somewhere in the darkness at last, I curiously open the door and step outside. A sweetish fragrance hits me with the warm evening air. It is very quiet. The only sound is the quiet rustle of the palms.\n\n\"Welcome to Hope Eden,\" she says.\n\nAnnegret leads us to one of the round huts that she and her husband, Shekar, rent to guests. It's made of red bricks that they bake themselves on the farm. Mosquito nets are stretched over the windows. There is no running water, but there's a big barrel from which water can be drawn, including the water for the toilet flush. Electricity comes from a solar cell on the roof.\n\nAt dinner in the main house lots of children join us at the table. They're all little relatives of Shekar that the couple have taken in so that they can go to school. Their own parents wouldn't be able to afford it. There is cassava with beans from the farm's fields. \"And you just left the receipt with that woman? Even though you don't even know her?\" she asks. \"How is she even going to get in contact with you? We have no phone reception here on the farm.\"\n\n\"Oh my. And internet?\" Just in case we don't get the suitcase in time I need to rebook our onward flights at midday tomorrow with an email to Sabine. That would definitely be easier than trying to find the relevant office somewhere around here.\n\nAnnegret smiles. \"No, there's no internet. For that you'd need to go into Abuja. It's in the opposite direction from the airport. It's about an hour to the center.\"\n\nRenate shakes her head. \"Let's just try our chances at the airport.\"\n\n\n\nThe next morning we are woken at dawn by all kinds of noises that sound like a jungle: the grove of palm trees coos, buzzes and chirrups. Annegret, who is already feeding her schoolchildren, helps us to our feet with freshly brewed coffee. It tastes delicious. \"Enjoy it,\" Renate advises me, \"we won't be getting anything like that in Maiduguri.\"\n\nWe set off immediately after breakfast. There is no public transport, such as an airport bus. So to avoid being a burden on our host we hire a car and driver from the village. \"If it all goes wrong, just come back to me,\" Annegret says as we wave goodbye.\n\nOn the way, Renate keeps trying to get through to the woman at the airport, on her mobile phone with the new SIM card, but to no avail. \"Maybe she hasn't got up yet,\" I wonder after the fifth attempt, \"or ...\"\n\n\"Or she's conned us,\" Renate says darkly. \"We've been a bit na\u00efve. With that form she could take legal possession of my suitcase whenever she liked. There's not a thing we can do. Why didn't we try her number yesterday?\"\n\nI can't give her an answer to that one. \"Maybe we'll find her at the airport,\" I say, trying to reassure us both.\n\nWe get there a short time later. But there's nothing going on at that time of day. Since no planes leave in the morning, the counters at the international terminal are all bolted shut. And of course there's no one we can ask about the suitcase.\n\nRenate and I are at a loss. She slumps exhausted on a bench and guards our luggage while I try to rebook our tickets in the national terminal. There are crowds of people at the Medview counter. I plunge into the crowd and fight my way to the front. It smells of sweat, perfume and deodorant.\n\n\"The tickets!\" the man from the airline demands when I finally manage to attract his attention amid all the competitive customers. Luckily the official language in Nigeria is English, so at least we're able to communicate with one another.\n\n\"We have e- tickets.\" I hand him my phone, on which the tickets are stored. He frowns. He definitely wants to see a piece of paper. But I haven't got one. Then he passes my phone to one of his colleagues behind the counter. They chat together, looking rather skeptical. \"Where did you book these?\" the first one asks.\n\n\"In Germany.\"\n\n\"Paid for already?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"But the numbers don't agree with our system.\"\n\nOh, great, I think. What's that supposed to mean? Is he trying to tell me that the tickets I bought in Germany are invalid? \"That's impossible,\" I protest helplessly. \"Please look again!\"\n\nMy phone wanders from hand to hand all around the airport, with me running after it. At least a dozen men stare at the document from abroad that's stored on it. It feels like hours until at last they find someone who's able to convert the international booking code into a local one \u2014 and who demands a healthy sum of money in return. I pay up.\n\nBut by now it's almost half past ten. Do we even have time to postpone the flight for another day? Just as I want to ask this awkward question, Renate hobbles up on her crutches.\n\nShe is beaming. \"The lady from the luggage office came,\" she cries, \"and the suitcase is there too!\"\n\n\"So I don't need to rebook?\"\n\n\"No, it's all fine!\"\n\nShe points to a young man who's come behind her to the counter with a trolley: all our luggage is stacked up on it. He zealously heaves our cases on to the scales, and wants to be rewarded accordingly. A hefty charge is also leveled on our excess baggage.\n\nThis is the first personal lesson that I learn about Nigeria, which enjoys the dubious reputation of being the most corrupt country in the world: there are lots of problems and there are lots of people who make money from solving those problems. Everything costs money. That's how the system works.\n\nThen we're on the Medview plane. I haven't a clue why the company should be called \"Mediterranean view.\" From the window I see the skyscrapers and the mosques of Abuja, whose domes gleam in the distance. And the vast outskirts of one- story houses that twist around the metropolis and spill further and further into the bush. The houses become increasingly humble the further they are from the center. The huts of the people who have moved from the country form the outermost ring around the city.\n\nWhen we've left even those behind, the land is more sparsely populated. Near Abuja the soil is still fertile and many of the fields grow maize or cassava. But the further north we fly, the sparser the vegetation. Soon there are only very scattered trees in the steppe- like landscape, through which the Fulani nomads drive their herds of thin cattle. The lack of rain has dried the ground out \u2014 even though the dry season has only just started. Everything seems to have the same earth- colored tone.\n\nAt last it becomes hazy. It looks as if a veil has settled over the earth. At first I think it must be clouds. But strangely they don't part even when the plane begins its descent.\n\n\"That's bad luck, the harmattan has started already,\" Renate says.\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"The desert storm.\"", "keywords": ["renate", "need", "suitcase", "sabine", "nigeria", "darkness", "airport", "maiduguri", "say", "phone", "tickets", "gift"], "polarity": 0.054944217045384346, "subjectivity": 0.4422938680428952},

The greatest financial cost of the opioid epidemic, according to the report, is in lost earnings and productivity losses to employers. Early deaths and substance abuse disorders also take a toll on local, state and federal government through lost tax revenue.\n\nThese costs are rising. One reason for the increase, says Corey Rhyan, a senior research analyst with Altarum's Center for Value and Health Care, is that more young people are being affected as the epidemic moves from prescription opioids to illicit drugs like heroin and fentanyl.\n\n\"The average age at which opioid deaths are occurring \u2014 you're looking at something in the late 30s or early 40s,\" Rhyan says. \"As a result, you're looking at people that are in the prime of the productive years of their lives.\"\n\nHealth care expenses linked to the crisis \u2014 more than $215 billion since 2001 \u2014 have been significant, too, the report suggests.

The idea is to train and educate potential candidates for local office \u2013 specifically city council or various local boards and commissions.\n\nWhat makes the ATXelerator different from other candidate schools is that it's also part tech accelerator. In a normal accelerator, participants pitch a business idea and vie for investor money. Here, they will pitch themselves as a candidate for local office and vie for campaign support.\n\n\"Competition brings out the best in people,\" says Ward Tisdale, the executive director of the center.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C.

Federal officials will get public feedback on the plan in Sacramento on Thursday. The Interior Department says it takes local concerns into account \u2014 as happened in a recent controversial move with Florida \u2014 but states have no direct say, since the leasing would take place in federally controlled waters.\n\nCalifornia thinks it may have found a way around. In fact, it's a strategy used the last time the West Coast was open for offshore oil drilling, in the 1980's, when President Reagan's Interior Secretary James Watt was leading the push.\n\n\"We have enough energy to meet America's needs for thousands of years,\" said Watt at the time, \"if we will have a government that will allow for its reasonable development.\"\n\nIt was not welcome news for many coastal cities in California. They were still spooked by a 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, in which some three million gallons of oil leaked from an offshore drilling operation and coated local beaches.\n\n\"We had to respond in kind,\" recalls John Laird, who's now California's secretary of Natural Resources, but was then mayor of Santa Cruz, a small coastal city south of San Francisco.\n\nLaird called a meeting with drilling opponents and everyone agreed: their response had to have some teeth.\n\n\"And I really struggled, thinking: teeth?\" Laird says. \"We're a city, and this is a federal government wanting to do this with the tacit approval of the state government.\"\n\nThen something occurred to him. When oil companies drill offshore, they still need to build infrastructure onshore, things like pipelines and helicopter pads. And it's cities who control the zoning and building permits that allow that, not the federal government.\n\n\"A coastal wall of resistance\"\n\nSanta Cruz proposed a ballot measure that said if an oil company wanted to build facilities on land, residents would have to vote on it first. It passed. The measure also designated funds to spread the idea, so Santa Cruz hired Dan Haifley to be an anti-oil Johnny Appleseed.\n\n\"I would sleep on couches and I would travel the state in my little car, tiny little thing,\" Haifley says.\n\nHe visited local officials along the coast, slide projector in hand. \"It was grassroots democracy and grassroots activism at its best,\" he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn all, Haifley convinced 26 coastal cities and counties to adopt similar policies. They were challenged by the oil industry, but upheld by a federal court.\n\nEven today, oil companies can't build new infrastructure without voter approval in most of those places. The zoning rules create what Haifley calls \"a coastal wall of resistance\" against offshore drilling.\n\nBut Would It Work Today?\n\nThe idea has reemerged, now that the Trump administration is proposing a dramatic expansion of oil leasing. California legislators are considering a bill that would ban new oil pipelines and piers in state-controlled waters, which extend up to three miles offshore. California's lieutenant governor, who chairs the State Lands Commission, has also threatened to block any pipeline permits to transport oil.\n\nSo, would that give an oil company pause?\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says Bob Fryklund with IHS Markit, which does research and consulting for the oil industry. \"The companies look at that. They look at the ease of operation.\"\n\nBut California's policies may not work as well as they once did. Fryklund says technology has improved and now companies can get oil without having to build a pipeline to shore. Just they use floating oil rigs, known as FPSOs.\n\n\"You have a giant ship that fills up full of oil and then goes off to a nearby port or refinery within that country or off somewhere else,\" he says. \"That's pretty standard operations around the world.\"\n\nThat method is more expensive. So, oil companies would have to be enticed by large oil reserves and high oil prices to make that worth it.

Her research is an inspiration to a generation of technically curious cheesemakers: she is the cheese geek's cheese geek. When American cheesemaker Mateo Kehler talks about the on-site laboratory that he and his brother Andy have set up at the Cellars at Jasper Hill in Vermont, he jokes that \"there is already a lab coat hanging up here with Marie-Christine's name on it.\"\n\nSo there was great excitement when Montel was invited to deliver a presentation on her work with the Salers producers and their gerles at the 2015 American Cheese Society conference in Providence, Rhode Island. The annual conference is the single largest gathering of North American cheesemakers, importers, and sellers. There are educational sessions, industry briefings, and plenty of swag. Delegates wear intricately color-coded badges to denote their status, with categories ranging from members of the press to senior attendees, who are labeled \"Aged to Perfection.\" At the 2015 meeting, twelve hundred people packed into the Rhode Island Convention Center to learn, gossip, and do business.\n\nWhen it came time for Montel's presentation, a large audience crowded into the seminar room. But as they heard the tale of the gerles and saw the experimental data, they sat unmoved. The elegance of the microbiology, the revalorization of ancient cheesemaking techniques, and the implications for understanding and enhancing their own cheeses were lost on the crowd. Instead, in the question and answer session at the end, it became clear that the research on gerles had seemed irrelevant to the majority of the audience. What most people wanted was advice on potential pathogens and handling issues with public health officials.\n\nThe audience had not been ready for her message, had not been primed for a world where microbial biodiversity could be the defining goal of good dairy farming. It was, said Montel afterward, as if she were \"from a different planet.\" It was true. She might as well have delivered a lecture on unicorn ranching. Despite our frustration, we could recognize and appreciate the concerns of the audience. Their problems were intimately familiar: this was the dairy world in which Bronwen's family had lived for over a century.\n\n\n\nYOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S HERD\n\nA decade earlier, amid the cocktail chatter at our wedding in London, two dairy industries collided. Many of our guests were Bronwen's colleagues from Neal's Yard Dairy in London, a company that has come to emblematize the revival of British farmhouse cheese. Seated next to the company's sales director was Bronwen's uncle Eddie. We always thought of Eddie as a car enthusiast ex-NASA engineer, but he was also a farmer, fighting a last stand to maintain the viability of the California dairy that had been founded by Bronwen's great-grandfather.\n\nAt the time, Eddie's farm in California was comfortably larger than any dairy operation in the United Kingdom. However, even with thousands of cattle, the farm was too small to prosper amid the vicissitudes of the American market for liquid milk. Despite milking high-yielding cows twenty-four hours a day, life was a struggle. But this was not a consequence of his poor management or lack of business savvy; rather, he was the prisoner of a market that was beyond his control.\n\nBronwen's great-grandfather, Fred Imsand, was a Swiss emigrant to California at the turn of the twentieth century. From a dairying family, he found work at a dairy while he romanced the chambermaids of San Francisco. He survived the 1906 earthquake by the simple expedient of standing in an empty lot during his milk-delivery run, and in the ensuing chaos he made his way to San Bernardino in Southern California, where through a combination of savings, resourcefulness, and gruff charm he acquired a farm of his own, Meadowbrook Dairy.\n\nThe dairy of Fred's era was diversified and complete. Beyond the cows and their milk, the family farmed chickens and pigs, smoked their own hams, and sold produce from their orchard. Yet Bronwen's grandparents eventually rebelled against the unremitting toil of this system, embracing the progressive promise of scale, mechanization, and specialization. By the late 1950s, the dairy was a successful local business, with a fleet of milk trucks and \u2014 as the Inland Empire grew into Eisenhower-era suburban comfort \u2014 five little dairy drive-thrus.\n\nFred had started out with a herd of twenty Holstein cows, but Bronwen's grandfather Eddie Sr. recognized the direction that the milk market was going and made every effort to expand the business. In this environment, Bronwen's mother's involvement in the dairy as a young woman was restricted to some light bookkeeping as she studied for her medical school exams; a loathing for calves' liver is the only legacy of her upbringing on a dairy farm.\n\nBy the early 1970s, as supermarkets began to dominate retail sales, Eddie Sr. decided to concentrate solely on producing liquid milk and abandoned direct-to-consumer sales completely. With that decision came expansion: by the time Bronwen's mother graduated from college, the herd numbered just under four hundred cows. It was ultimately a question of pragmatism, and decisions were made in order to survive. Eddie Sr. had spent a year studying at the University of California, Davis, in the 1930s before the worsening economic climate of the Great Depression demanded that he return to work on the farm, and at each stage of Meadowbrook Dairy's expansion, he looked to the experts at UC Davis \u2014 one of the major American centers for industrial agricultural research \u2014 for advice. Each decision he made was based on progressive mainstream ideas about best practice.\n\nThe pace at which Meadowbrook Dairy grew mirrors trends in dairy farming within the United States at large. We can see these changes reflected most starkly in US Department of Agriculture statistics. From 1970 to 2006, average herd size leapt from just 19 cows to 120 cows per farm. Hidden within the arithmetic mean is an even more significant change: small dairy farms are disappearing rapidly. The smallest class of farm, those with fewer than thirty cows, might still constitute nearly 30 percent of all dairy operations, but together this bottom third represents only 2 percent of all cows and 1 percent of milk production. In contrast, between 2000 and 2006, the number of farms with more than two thousand cows doubled. In 2006, almost a quarter of all milk production \u2014 and the majority in the western United States \u2014 took place at these megadairies.\n\nEurope is also seeing a steady consolidation of the dairy industry and growth of herd size. The number of registered dairy producers in the United Kingdom dropped by more than half from 1998 to 2013. From 2008/9 to 2012/13, the only UK dairy farms growing in size were those producing more than two million liters of milk a year; based on average milk yields, the average herd size of these farms was approximately three hundred cows. With milk prices at historic lows, milk production at dairies with more than two thousand cows is becoming more widespread. Where the United States has led, Europe is following.\n\nChange came rapidly to Meadowbrook. A sudden series of family bereavements led to a swift generational succession, and in 1978, at age twenty-seven, Bronwen's uncle Eddie took full responsibility. It was a tough time. The suburban expansion of San Bernardino was about to swallow the dairy, and strategic decisions had to be made. Again, the advice of the dairy extension program at UC Davis proved critical. Resisting a possible move to the San Joaquin Valley, Eddie relocated the entire operation fifty miles north across the San Gabriel Mountains to El Mirage. While the high desert did not afford lush pastures, a new five-hundred-acre alfalfa ranch provided vertical integration. The dairy's systems were pared down for maximum efficiency, and an anaerobic digester was installed that converted manure into electricity. Again, scale increased. At its peak, the new operation was milking 2,200 cows, but life was still a struggle.\n\nFor this most mainstream of dairies, there was no sense that processing the milk on the farm or attempting to produce a unique product could add anything to the sustainability of the operation. When family members talk about the dairy, their pride is palpable, but each commercial decision and each stage of growth is explained and rationalized as the inevitable consequence of market conditions. Over the more than thirty years Eddie spent running the farm, he was beaten down by a commodity market that he could not control. His is a common stoicism: \"Every farmer goes through periods of up and down; it's a cyclic business as far as profit and loss go. It's never been a business where you can count on a percentage of margin.\"\n\nThe farm's milk contract paid according to total solids \u2014 the number of pounds of butterfat and protein that the herd could produce \u2014 so the system was optimized for maximum production with maximum efficiency. In this model of dairy farming, controlling feed costs is everything, and Eddie was forced to become increasingly sophisticated at supplementing the silage and hay that he made himself with cheaply available commodity by-products. Technology helped. Eventually, it was simply a question of entering the details of the almond hulls, cottonseed, or citrus pulp into the computer to get the appropriate balance for a nutritionally optimized total mixed ration.\n\nTo this extent, Meadowbrook Dairy was the diametric opposite of Guy Chambon's operation. The entire conceit of Chambon's Salers Tradition is to have cows who will thrive in a place where they will eat interesting food \u2014 hence the painstaking twice-daily milking in the pastures on the top of a mountain \u2014 and then let the cheese make itself, with a little help from the gerles. Uniqueness is fundamental. Taken together, these farming and cheesemaking practices, from the choice of the cussed and archaic Salers breed to the maintenance of the biodiversity of the mountainside pastures and the microbial biofilms on the wooden gerles, make for the production of something that could not be achieved anywhere else. In contrast, Meadowbrook Dairy tacitly accepted that their output would be blended with milk from many other sources and that the route toward commercial sustainability was through efficiency and growth. Instead of keeping cows in a place where they would eat interesting food, Meadowbrook kept its cows where space was cheap and then fed them carefully calculated inputs to keep costs down and yields up.\n\nWhen none of his children expressed any interest in dairy farming, Eddie ultimately took the opportunity to divest himself of the business. When we talk with him now, his sense of relief is clear, even if it is bittersweet: \"We ended up taking this as a time we could slow down and keep the [alfalfa] farm out in Inyokern, and we donated the land to the water district. It was an opportunity that comes along only once or twice in a lifetime.\"\n\nAlthough the cheesemakers attending Montel's presentation at the American Cheese Society conference almost certainly operated on a smaller scale than thousand-cow dairies, the mentality with which Eddie worked would have been familiar to them. It is true in much of Europe as well, where the scale might be smaller still but the same pressures toward consolidation, volume, and efficiency are being felt. For Bronwen, this too is familiar. When she was a teenager, she and her family had managed, by following received notions of best practice, to domesticate industrial dairying.\n\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL WRIT SMALL\n\nUnlike her mother, Bronwen did not grow up on a dairy farm. Visits to her cousins at Meadowbrook Dairy brought exotic new experiences, like the opportunity to climb mountains of fuzzy cottonseed feed, but the dairy and its evolution registered only vaguely on her consciousness. Her parents settled several hours further south in eastern San Diego County, in the foothills of the Cuyamaca Mountains. With hot, dry summers and mild winters, the area was dominated by chaparral and horse fancy. Surrounded by equestrianism, Bronwen soon became obsessed by the desire to own a horse.\n\nAnd so as she began junior high school, Bronwen joined the local 4-H club along with her best friend Melody; it seemed more exciting than the Girl Scouts, and it would give her the chance to make a halter for the horse of her dreams. But Melody, whose family owned a billy goat called Buck Rogers, also convinced Bronwen to sign up for the dairy goat group. At the first meeting, she was exposed to the vision of baby goats frolicking in fresh straw, and all thoughts of horses were immediately banished. Bronwen's parents recognized a modified win when they saw one, and within days a goat pen was being constructed in the backyard.\n\nWhen Bronwen's parents, a musicologist and a physician, bought a house with land, they had no intention of dabbling in domestic dairying; they simply needed space where they could practice the violin without the neighbors complaining. Music loomed large in their lives \u2014 they had first met as teenagers playing in the same orchestra \u2014 and distance from other neighbors allowed assiduous practice to be combined with the odd hours of the work schedule at the hospital. While Bronwen's mother had been raised on the dairy farm and her father's family had dabbled in semisuburban farming when he was young, they had no firsthand knowledge of animal husbandry. Jerry Belanger's book Raising Milk Goats the Modern Way (Garden Way Publishing, 1975) would be their homesteading bible.\n\nThe goats, Natasha and Ginger, were to play a major role in the life of Bronwen's family for the next six years. They grew into glossy, glorified pets, but a vague sense of paranoia surrounded their management. Their pen sat within a two-and-a-half acre goat smorgasbord packed with sumac, foxtails, eucalyptus, manzanita, and native sages. This type of Mediterranean scrubland is one of the classic environments for goat foraging, a way of exploiting marginal land that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nThe goat book, however, suggested otherwise, claiming that a diet foraged from the native chaparral was poor in nutritional value and would lead to malnourished goats and problems with worms. The family deemed it much safer to buy in a mixture of hay, fermented alfalfa with molasses, and vitamin-enriched, grain-based goat chow for them to eat. In an area famous for its raging wildfires, with strict requirements for brush control, the goats looked on quizzically every summer as Bronwen's father scoured the property with a weed whacker and the family raked and bagged up the fallen weeds to take to the local dump. Ironically, within the world of forestry management, goat grazing is now regarded as one of the most effective weed management solutions for fire prevention; it is also inexpensive, nontoxic, and nearly carbon neutral. At its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Google now uses goats for just this purpose.\n\nThen there was the question of sex. There was no mistaking when the goats came into heat: the sex-starved animals would stand on the big rock in the middle of the pen and bleat loudly and incessantly. Were it not for this habit, they would likely have been bred only a couple of times. But as it was, they got their way year after year. When it came time to breed them, they were loaded into the back of the family's dusty Chevrolet Suburban and whisked off to the goat breeder's for a quickie with the buck. Bronwen's father remembers setting aside his Messiaen program notes on a day when the rest of the family was gone, the kids all at school, and \"driving the goat off to get nailed.\"\n\nWhen the baby goats arrived, the family kept the females or gave them to other members of the 4-H club who wished to found their own goat dynasties, but their sentimental approach to animal husbandry left them in a quandary when it came to the boys. The first set of kids were both, tragically, male. They were sent off at a tender age to \"eat grass\" in a friend's backyard. Another male kid followed; we learned in researching this book that he ended up as the main course at a family friend's Easter celebration. Had Bronwen known the truth at the time, she would have been beside herself, but it highlights a perennial problem for sentimental domestic dairy farmers: males. Unless you are prepared to eat them, they have no value. Bronwen's reservations about eating her pets were not remarkable. When we talked with Jeannette Beranger, senior program manager for the Livestock Conservancy in the United States, it became clear that many sentimentalists dabble in homesteading with rare breeds. Beranger launched into an anecdote about an enthusiastic couple with whom she worked who could not bear to see any of their males killed or eaten. The couple had the capital to keep them, ultimately tending a separate paddock of forty lost boys. Without those resources, even the ethically consistent lacto-vegetarian will eat veal.", "keywords": ["reinventing", "wheel", "eddie", "milk", "family", "farm", "goats", "goat", "bronwens", "meadowbrook", "dairy", "cows"], "polarity": 0.10870145330859624, "subjectivity": 0.4613576410362123},

In many cases, it was just the opposite.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma\n\nAround 20 percent of Oklahoma's schools now hold classes just four days a week. Last year, Highway Patrol officers were given a mileage limit because the state couldn't afford to put gas in their tanks. Medicaid provider rates have been cut to the point that rural nursing homes and hospitals are closing, and the prisons are so full that the director of corrections says they're on the brink of a crisis.\n\nIn her State of the State address Monday, Gov. Mary Fallin expressed the state's frustration.\n\n\"We have two clear choices,\" she said. \"We can continue down a path of sliding backwards, or we can choose the second path, which is to say 'Enough is enough! We can do better! We deserve better! Our children deserve better, too!' \"\n\nMany of the tax cuts and subsequent revenue failures have happened on Fallin's watch. Now she wants to fix it, and she's gotten behind a large coalition of business leaders who have come up with a plan to raise taxes and enact reforms.\n\nA drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not.\n\n\"It's math,\" said banker David Rainbolt, a leader of the group known as Step Up Oklahoma. \"You can look at the problems we have and realize that there's not sustainable revenue going forward. This problem will occur over and over and over again in a commodity-based economy like ours unless we create revenue streams that create stability.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure requiring 75 percent of the Legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike.\n\nThis year, that supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up scheme meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen thinks it's just not enough.\n\n\"A drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not,\" he said. \"One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it.\"\n\nDemocrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while poor Oklahomans have borne the brunt of the cuts to state services. The Step Up plan, they say, doesn't do enough to protect the poor from paying to fix a mess they didn't make.\n\nRainbolt and the bipartisan business coalition that introduced the compromise plan say the state is in a mess and there is no easy way to fix it. They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was saleable to the Legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nOklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators \u2014 And Lots Of Criticism Oklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators -- And Lots Of Criticism Download \u00b7 4:10 4:10\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet.

The Republican moral cowardness must end,\" Pelosi said near the beginning of the speech. \"So I'm going to go on as long as my leadership minute allows.\" (Leaders such as Pelosi are granted the courtesy of speaking beyond \u2014 in this case well beyond \u2014 the usual minute allotted to House members for floor remarks.)\n\nHour after hour as she spoke, Pelosi read statements from people in the country illegally who were brought here as children. Most of the statements described the security and opportunities DACA has provided, or the careers or educational paths of people soon at risk for deportation.\n\nPelosi also repeatedly framed the immigration debate in moral terms, at times reading directly from the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nSen.

On Tuesday, Ryan said, \"We're not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn't support.\"\n\nThroughout the speech, Pelosi asked Ryan to change his mind and promise floor debate.\n\nPelosi's marathon came the same day her Senate counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., struck a budget deal with McConnell. The agreement is broad and includes increased military and domestic spending, raising the debt ceiling and providing expanded disaster relief funding. But it does not include any DACA extension.\n\nPelosi and other Democratic leaders had initially promised to secure a DACA extension by the end of 2017; then, when December 31 came and went, by a mid-January deadline to fund the federal government.\n\nHouse Democrats repeatedly voted against short-term-spending bills that did not include protections for people in the program. Senate Democrats joined them in January, blocking a funding measure and forcing a government shutdown.\n\nBut many Senate Democrats immediately viewed the move as a mistake, and the Friday night shutdown ended by Monday afternoon, affecting just one workday for most federal employees.\n\nBy telegraphing their hesitance to force another shutdown, and then agreeing to a long-term budget deal, Democrats gave up the one source of leverage that the minority party held to force a DACA fix.\n\nIn that context, Pelosi's marathon speech can be viewed as a signal to the progressive base that Democrats aren't quitting on DREAMers.\n\nBut the high-profile move came as Republicans are once again making Pelosi a centerpiece of their House campaigns. In an upcoming Western Pennsylvania special election, conservative groups are running ads tying Democrat Conor Lamb to Pelosi, despite Lamb's having told reporters he wouldn't vote for her as Democratic leader.\n\nAt a rally for Republican candidate Rick Saccone last week, speaker after speaker warned a vote for Lamb was a vote to return Pelosi to the speakership.\n\nStill, Pelosi shows no signs of stepping aside or giving up on efforts to secure a DACA deal.\n\nMcConnell, Ryan and President Trump have all said they want to find a permanent fix for the roughly 700,000 people enrolled in the DACA program, which is set to expire March 5 under terms set by Trump last year. Pelosi sounded increasingly skeptical that Republicans will act.\n\n\"We do not deserve any right \u2014 any of us \u2014 to say we love DREAMers, or anything like that, unless we have an intention of doing anything about it,\" Pelosi said, more than four hours into the speech.", "keywords": ["dreamers", "protests", "pelosi", "stall", "senate", "talks", "marathon", "daca", "ryan", "democrats", "house", "speech", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.024812030075187973, "subjectivity": 0.3809993734335839},

In many cases, it was just the opposite.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma\n\nAround 20 percent of Oklahoma's schools now hold classes just four days a week. Last year, Highway Patrol officers were given a mileage limit because the state couldn't afford to put gas in their tanks. Medicaid provider rates have been cut to the point that rural nursing homes and hospitals are closing, and the prisons are so full that the director of corrections says they're on the brink of a crisis.\n\nIn her State of the State address Monday, Gov. Mary Fallin expressed the state's frustration.\n\n\"We have two clear choices,\" she said. \"We can continue down a path of sliding backwards, or we can choose the second path, which is to say 'Enough is enough! We can do better! We deserve better! Our children deserve better, too!' \"\n\nMany of the tax cuts and subsequent revenue failures have happened on Fallin's watch. Now she wants to fix it, and she's gotten behind a large coalition of business leaders who have come up with a plan to raise taxes and enact reforms.\n\nA drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not.\n\n\"It's math,\" said banker David Rainbolt, a leader of the group known as Step Up Oklahoma. \"You can look at the problems we have and realize that there's not sustainable revenue going forward. This problem will occur over and over and over again in a commodity-based economy like ours unless we create revenue streams that create stability.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure requiring 75 percent of the Legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike.\n\nThis year, that supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up scheme meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen thinks it's just not enough.\n\n\"A drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not,\" he said. \"One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it.\"\n\nDemocrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while poor Oklahomans have borne the brunt of the cuts to state services. The Step Up plan, they say, doesn't do enough to protect the poor from paying to fix a mess they didn't make.\n\nRainbolt and the bipartisan business coalition that introduced the compromise plan say the state is in a mess and there is no easy way to fix it. They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was saleable to the Legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nOklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators \u2014 And Lots Of Criticism Oklahoma Rattlesnake Roundup Attracts Thousands Of Spectators -- And Lots Of Criticism Download \u00b7 4:10 4:10\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet.

Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"Now, all parties must focus on getting a fair map in place. Gerrymandering is wrong and we must correct errors of the past with the existing map. My team is ready, willing and able to work with the General Assembly to ensure a new map is fair and within the clear orders given by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\"\n\nDemocrats had already been eyeing the Philadelphia suburbs as a prime target for picking up Republican-held congressional seats this fall. The ruling \u2014 and the new maps that will follow \u2014 will boost Democrats' efforts.\n\n\"I think a fair map in Pennsylvania can give Democrats an opportunity to win up to five seats in Pennsylvania,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told NPR last week.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to several of the long, thin districts drawn on the eastern edge of the state as prime examples of lines drawn to maximize the number of Republican-held seats. The state is currently represented by 12 Republicans and five Democrats in the House, with one empty seat that was formerly held by a Republican.\n\nThe map passed with bipartisan support in 2011. Republican leaders in Pennsylvania's General Assembly have decried the state court ruling as partisan and have refused to provide the court with map-drawing data requested by the judges.\n\n\"We still do not believe that there was a violation of the state Constitution, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court can direct us to draw a new congressional map, or that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has the authority to draw a new Congressional District Map under the Pennsylvania Constitution or United States Constitution,\" state Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati said in a statement.\n\nState Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman conceded the 2011 maps were drawn with politics partly in mind but argued that's perfectly valid. The U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican said, has repeatedly ruled that state legislatures have the right to draw district lines.\n\n\"Obviously the Legislature is a political body. We have Republicans and we have Democrats. It's a political body by definition,\" he told NPR. \"So they've put that in the hands of a political body to make decisions. If you look at maps in Illinois, you look at maps in Maryland, I think you'll see maps that have interesting lines as well, that favor [Democrats]. Because they were in control. But the Supreme Court has time and time, and federal courts have time and time, ruled that that is allowed.\"\n\nA federal court recently upheld Pennsylvania's congressional districts. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering two cases that test whether extreme partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional. One case tests state legislative district lines drawn in Wisconsin, while the second looks at a congressional district in Maryland. The court is expected to rule by June.\n\nBut Pennsylvania's ruling was based on the state, not federal, Constitution, and Justice Samuel Alito declined to interfere.\n\nThat means Pennsylvania's new map has to be drawn immediately. The state court ruling gave Pennsylvania's General Assembly until Friday to draw new boundaries and Wolf an additional week to approve or veto the new map.\n\nIf Wolf and Republican lawmakers can't reach a consensus by Feb. 15, the Democratic-controlled state Supreme Court will draw the lines itself. The deadline for prospective candidates for Congress to file with the state is in March.\n\nWolf, like many Democrats, has long decried the 2011 lines as overly partisan. Comparing elections to baseball, Wolf said, \"I have my favorite home team, and I love to see them win, but I would not like to see them win if the game were unfair and they got five strikes, while the opponents got two strikes.\"\n\nBut Wolf has declined to publicly provide specifics on what he would like lawmakers to prioritize \u2014 geographic compactness, competitiveness or other factors \u2014 as they race to draw new lines. \"My biggest concern is unfairness,\" he told NPR.\n\nPennsylvania Republicans argue the state Supreme Court has now mandated an unrealistically rushed timeline.

Little things would annoy her, like her glider chair.\n\n\"It had started to squeak,\" she says. \"And so when I'm sitting there rocking the baby and it's squeaking, I would just get so angry at that stupid chair.\"\n\nShe read online that irritability could be a symptom of postpartum depression \u2014 a condition that affects up to 1 in 7 women during or after pregnancy, according to the American Psychological Association. In California, where Porten lives, those rates are even higher, spurring state lawmakers to introduce a package of bills to improve mental health screening and treatment for new moms.\n\nPorten hopes they help women avoid what she went through.\n\nShe went to Capital OB/GYN, a women's clinic in Sacramento that accepts her Medicaid coverage as payment, to talk about medication options and therapy. Porten admitted to the nurse that she was having some violent thoughts.\n\n\"I described maybe hitting myself or squeezing the baby too tight,\" she says. \"But I was very adamant through the entire appointment that I was not going to hurt myself and I was not going to hurt my children.\"\n\nBut, Porten says, the nurse's manner toward her changed. \"I could see in that moment that she stopped listening to me,\" Porten says.\n\nThe nurse called the police. The police escorted Porten and her baby to the emergency room. Hospital staff made her change into a gown and took her purse, but they let her keep her diaper bag for the baby. They put them both in a room, under constant watch, though the hospital staff was sympathetic, Porten says.\n\n\"It's like, everybody knows I'm not crazy,\" she says. \"Everybody knows that this is normal \u2014 but they're following protocol.\"\n\nFinally, at midnight, 10 hours after she first got to the doctor's office, a social worker sent her home. Porten wrote on Facebook that the whole thing made her feel like a criminal.\n\n\"It was all legality,\" Porten says. \"Everybody was protecting their own liability instead of thinking of me.\"\n\nAdministrators at Capital OB/GYN declined to comment. Gary Zavoral, a spokesman for Sutter Health, which runs the emergency room where Porten was taken, says that once a patient arrives in the ER for assessment, hospital staff must follow strict protocols.\n\n\"The process is to make sure everybody is safe: the individual's safe, the family's safe, the staff is safe,\" he says. \"The process does take some hours, so 10 hours is not unusual.\"\n\nWhen patients reference violent thoughts, it forces doctors to think about things in a different way, says Dr. Melanie Thomas, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nCalifornia law allows doctors to involuntarily confine a person with a mental disorder if they are a danger to themselves or others. But Thomas says what constitutes imminent danger can be vague.\n\n\"You can imagine a provider, a social worker, any number of people might interpret that phrase in different ways, about what is necessary to report and what isn't,\" she says.\n\nThe laws and medical protocols don't always line up, Thomas says. There have been times she felt asked to rely on legal reasoning over her clinical judgment.\n\n\"The fragmented aspects of our system of care make it difficult to get women the help that they really want,\" Thomas says.\n\nThat is one reason lawmakers in Sacramento are now introducing a package of bills to specifically address maternal mental health. Assemblyman Brian Maienschein, R-San Diego, is backing two of them. One would require doctors to screen new moms for depression; under current law, it's voluntary.\n\n\"The numbers here are so significant that I think it's something that doctors really should understand and should be prepared to both diagnose and treat,\" he says. Screening, he adds, also \"educates a woman in that situation that this is an issue that may impact her.\"\n\nMaienschein's other bill would direct the state to tap into a new federal pot of money set aside for postpartum programs and awareness campaigns. It was established under the 21 Century Cures Act, which was passed in the final months of the Obama administration.\n\n\"Getting federal money is a great thing,\" Maienschein says. \"It's federal money that's available that I'd like to see California have, versus another state.\"\n\nThe legislation has given Jessica Porten a new purpose. People have told her that she should sue Capital OB/GYN for calling the police. But she says no.\n\n\"I walk into that waiting room and I see tons of Medi-Cal recipients \u2014 so they're all low-income,\" she says. \"If I sue, it's only going to cause monetary damages to a facility that is clearly short on resources.\"\n\nInstead, Porten says she'll advocate to get the new bills passed in California. She thinks that is the way to help the clinic's physicians and nurses do a better job of helping new moms get the care they need.\n\n\"I'm not going to take that away,\" she says. \"I'm going to build it up.\"\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KQED and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["cops", "thomas", "postpartum", "calls", "staff", "room", "woman", "health", "seeks", "nurse", "depression", "doctors", "going", "porten", "safe", "right", "baby", "help"], "polarity": 0.06265308616115067, "subjectivity": 0.5237514546385512},

And Hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\"\n\nEarier this month, he also bragged about the latest jobs report, focusing in on minorities in particular.\n\nOn Twitter he cited that black unemployment is \"the lowest ever recorded in our country.\" And he jabbed: \"Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!\"\n\nAnd then at a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, he did it again, saying, \"African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our records.\"\n\nPresidents often take credit for a strong economy, and Trump fits that mold, touting jobs and stock market numbers regularly. So we decided to fact-check Trump on this claim: Is he right, and are these numbers his doing?\n\nThe claim\n\nBlack and Hispanic unemployment are at or near record lows.\n\nThe short answer\n\nTrump's numbers are right, but it's generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.\n\nThe long answer\n\nTrump is right that African-American unemployment hit a record low in December. The unemployment rate for black Americans is currently 6.8 percent, the lowest level recorded since the government started keeping track in January 1972.\n\nAnd he's also right that the Hispanic unemployment rate is down a point over the last year \u2014 it was at 4.9 percent in December, down from 5.9 percent in December 2016. That is close to a record low, though it's also up 0.1 point from November.\n\nBut still, fact check: true on Trump's numbers.\n\nHowever, that's not all Trump is doing in this tweet. He is implying that he caused these low African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates.\n\nAnd a big problem with that claim is that those rates had been falling for long before Trump took office, and their declines don't appear to have picked up speed. This implies that there's nothing specific that Trump did to change this rate.\n\nIndeed, both of these rates have been falling relatively steadily since around 2010, early in President Obama's tenure in the White House.\n\nSo have the unemployment rates for all races and ethnic groups tracked by the Labor Department. In general, these unemployment rates tend to move together. So while Trump called out the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates, they haven't changed in any remarkable way, relative to other groups' unemployment rates.\n\nSeparately, the president's Council of Economic Advisers touted the unemployment rate of other demographic groups on Friday, shortly after the latest jobs report was released.\n\n\"The overall unemployment rate, which by October had dropped to 4.1 percent, represented a 17-year low by year's end,\" they wrote. \"The benefits of the low rates were felt broadly, resulting in unemployment rates for America's veterans, African-Americans and Hispanics that reached historic lows in 2017.\"\n\nThe total unemployment rate is quite low, at 4.1 percent. That's not a record, but for comparison with that African-American rate, it is near its lowest point since 1972.\n\nSo Trump here is trying to make a political point \u2014 one that he has made before \u2014 seeming to tell minorities that they should support him more than they do. But then, the president has a decidedly uneasy relationship with black Americans, as NPR's Brakkton Booker wrote on Saturday, and his rhetoric on immigration has also upset some Hispanics.\n\nThis leads to the bigger question of how much Trump has to do with any of this job growth, regardless of race or ethnicity.\n\nBy the jobs numbers themselves, it doesn't look like he has changed much here. In fact, the average job creation in Trump's first year is slightly lower than it has been in prior years. Employers added 171,000 new jobs each month, on average, in 2017. In 2016, that figure was 187,000, and in 2015, it was 226,000.\n\nIt is possible that the tax plan that Trump recently signed into law will inspire employers to hire more. Businesses could conceivably plow some of the money they save on their taxes thanks to that plan into job creation. In a late-November Yahoo poll of more than 1,200 business owners, half said the new tax plan would make them more likely to hire.\n\nThen again, a majority of economists polled by the University of Chicago predict that long term, the tax plan won't lead to higher economic growth.\n\nIt's not that Trump has had zero effect on the economy. Though a strong global economy has been the main reason stocks are climbing ever higher, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in December, the president's agenda of deregulation and cutting corporate taxes has also likely very played some part in pushing stocks ever higher.\n\nBut the case that Trump has therefore significantly boosted job creation through the stock market isn't particularly strong, says one economist.\n\n\"To the extent that that affects business decisions, it may be that the president is having some impact on employment,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But it's very important not to overstate that.\"\n\nThere's also a bigger problem with the idea that Trump has created all these jobs \u2014 presidents don't have much immediate control over the economy, period.\n\nIt's true that they push policies or make hires that can affect economic performance \u2014 George W. Bush first appointed former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who helmed the central bank as it worked to pull the country out of recession; and President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus. It's also true that at the end of any given president's tenure, we look at the job market under that president.\n\nBut there's so much about the economy that presidents don't control \u2014 business cycles and other countries' economic health, for example. The White House also can't control broader macroeconomic trends, like the U.S. economy's long-term shift from goods-producing to service-based industries.\n\nIndeed, a 2015 paper from Princeton economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson found that while the economy has tended to grow faster under Democratic presidents, policy actions don't appear to account for that difference.\n\n\"Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the D-R growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim,\" they wrote.\n\nSo could a president \u2014 with Congress' help \u2014 target communities with particularly high unemployment? Yes, says one expert \u2014 particularly in one policy area Trump already has been championing.\n\n\"There needs to be a deliberate attempt to retrain and recruit people into the economy through infrastructure programs,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is relatively low \u2014 near what economists call \"full employment\" \u2014 it remains true that the black unemployment rate is always much higher than the national rate. He believes that targeted infrastructure policy could reduce that gap, helping disadvantaged Americans get back to work.\n\n\"Full employment means nothing to black folk in Baltimore or St. Louis or Pittsburgh,\" Perry said. \"For far too long, black unemployment has been the sacrificial lamb of full employment, and so again, if there is an infrastructure plan put on the table, it should be targeted at populations in areas that are largely out of work. [And] not only inner-city black America; it's also rural white men who are being left behind by the economy.\"\n\nIf that's true, it seems likely to remain a hypothetical. Democrats and Republicans alike champion the idea of infrastructure, but partisan divides on how to do it remain so wide that passing an infrastructure package this year would most likely be a heavy lift.", "keywords": ["touts", "black", "unemployment", "trump", "fact", "rate", "africanamericans", "presidents", "rates", "hispanics", "check", "job", "economy", "president", "low"], "polarity": 0.10759792185928543, "subjectivity": 0.41548236906191444},

No reason was given. Cha is a professor at Georgetown University who served as director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn a Washington Post opinion piece published Tuesday, Cha recounted that while under consideration for the post, he shared his view that a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea could escalate into a war that \"would likely kill tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Americans.\"\n\nThe pre-emptive strike option advocated by some Trump aides is sometimes referred to the \"bloody nose\" strategy. That strategy, as Gerald Seib at The Wall Street Journal explained earlier this month, goes like this:\n\n\"React to some nuclear or missile test with a targeted strike against a North Korean facility to bloody Pyongyang's nose and illustrate the high price the regime could pay for its behavior. The hope would be to make that point without inciting a full-bore reprisal by North Korea. \"It's an enormously risky idea, and there is a debate among Trump administration officials about whether it is feasible. North Koreans have a vast array of artillery tubes pointed across the demilitarized zone at Seoul, the capital of South Korea, with which they could inflict thousands of casualties within minutes if they choose to unleash an all-out barrage. \"Now, that danger is coupled with the risk that the North Koreans could attempt to use a nuclear weapon if they choose to escalate in retaliation against even a single strike.\"\n\nIn his piece in the Post, Cha agrees. He argues that a retaliatory strike might aim for South Korea, which isn't protected by U.S. missile defenses. Among the 51 million people living in South Korea, the Korea Immigration Service says 140,000 are Americans, NBC News reports, including 28,500 U.S. military personnel.\n\nCha advocates instead for a four-point alternative strategy that calls for U.S., regional and global pressure on North Korea to denuclearize. \"This strategy is likely to deliver the same potential benefits as a limited strike, along with other advantages, without the self-destructive costs,\" he writes.\n\nThat opinion took him out of the running for the ambassador job, the Post reports.\n\nMichael Green, a former Bush administration official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells NPR that although there were indications of problems with Cha's security checks as a Korean-American, he believes the decision is primarily about Cha's political views.\n\n\"The background and security and ethics checks that he had to go through before his name was sent to Seoul, which it was, for what's called agr\u00e9ment \u2014 sort of pre-announcement approval \u2014 just suggest that the real issue was the growing opposition in and out of government to a military strike and I think he was associated with that,\" Green says.\n\nKelly Magsamen of the Center for American Progress, who served in both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, tells NPR that any president needs to hear all sides.\n\n\"I would want somebody coming in and saying 'Okay, have you considered these downsides?' or 'Here would be the potential impact, maybe this isn't the best option. Maybe we should pursue a different option,' \" she says. \"You'd think you would want that level of debate especially if you are considering something like the use of force, which should always be a last resort.\"\n\nMagsamen says South Korea was clearly hoping to have someone installed in the ambassador post by now \u2014 with tensions high and the Olympics in Pyeongchang just a week away.", "keywords": ["policy", "strategy", "white", "preemptive", "view", "ambassador", "korea", "apparently", "north", "scuttles", "post", "security", "cha", "house", "south", "pick", "strike"], "polarity": -0.007264808362369348, "subjectivity": 0.3838327526132404},

Morrisey, a former lobbyist for a trade group that represents Miami-Luken and other drug distributors, inherited the lawsuit in 2013 after ousting longtime Attorney General Darrell McGraw. \"H.D. Smith paid the state $3.5 million to settle the same pill-dumping allegations in January 2017.\"\n\nThe House committee gave the companies until Feb. 9 to fulfill its request for information and give a briefing.\n\n\"We will continue to investigate these distributors' shipments of large quantities of powerful opioids across West Virginia, including what seems to be a shocking lack of oversight over their distribution practices,\" Walden and Pallone said in their statement. \"These numbers are outrageous, and we will get to the bottom of how this destruction was able to be unleashed across West Virginia.\"", "keywords": ["3000", "pills", "committee", "pharmacy", "miamiluken", "town", "drug", "208", "opioids", "million", "painkillers", "distributors", "shipped", "west", "virginia"], "polarity": 0.09310185185185185, "subjectivity": 0.4568320105820107},

And for state government coffers, the Republican-led overhaul may not cut as cleanly along ideological lines as Democrats say.\n\nMontana\n\nTake Montana, which Donald Trump won by 20 points. The state Legislature is dominated by Republicans who are championing the new federal tax law as nothing but good news for the state.\n\nBut Montana's governor, Democrat Steve Bullock, warns the tax changes could pose a threat to his state's finances.\n\n\"This is a bad deal for Montana and for families all across the country,\" Bullock wrote in a tweet soon after Congress passed the tax overhaul.\n\nThis month, the head of the governor's budgeting office announced the state could expect to lose $20 million in revenue over the next two years, mainly because of how the federal law changes the way Montana collects corporate income tax.\n\nAnd $20 million is on the low end of projections by state economists.\n\n\"With experts on both sides, we thought it appropriate to err on the side of less loss to state revenue, because that was really the legislative intent in Congress,\" Montana State Budget Director Dan Villa said. \"It was not the intent to have that implication come down on the state.\"\n\nMontana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas says the analysis by the governor's office is nothing but politics.\n\n\"We don't see any impact except positive impacts,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Montana Legislature meets once every two years, and there are no plans to call a special session to deal with the disagreement over projections. Although, state lawmakers could be called back into session if consensus grows around a loss more than the governor's estimate of $20 million.\n\nNotably, the Montana Department of Revenue suggests it could be more than double that. Director Mike Kadas, a Bullock appointee, cites the fact that Montana is one of 17 states coupling their tax code with federal law in a way that could result in a loss in personal and corporate income tax.\n\nHow Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law How Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law Listen \u00b7 10:25 10:25\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland is not one of those 17. The Mid-Atlantic, left-leaning state is expecting a windfall from the Republican-led update to the federal tax code.\n\nThe state comptroller's office expects a boost to state and local income tax revenue of at least $300 million in a single year, unless the state General Assembly acts to prevent it.\n\nMaryland's tax code is more directly coupled with the federal code, so Maryland taxpayers can take most of the same deductions on their federal and state tax returns.\n\n\"It's a very sensible choice that almost all states have made, basically to allow taxpayers who have calculated their taxes for the federal purposes just to take those same calculations, make just a couple of tweaks to figure out how much they owe the state,\" said Andrew Blair-Stanek, a tax specialist who teaches at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n\nThis is intended to simplify the tax-filing process for residents, as well as enforcement for the state. But it also means taxpayers can only deduct something from their state taxes if they have already deducted it from their federal taxes.\n\nThe new federal law increases the standard deduction while limiting some previous deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes. As a result, roughly 700,000 Maryland residents who itemized deductions on their past tax returns will shrink their federal tax bills if they switch to the standard deduction, said Andrew Schaufele, director of the state Bureau of Revenue Estimates in the comptroller's office.\n\nBut if all 700,000 take the standard deduction on both their federal and state tax returns, the state is expected to collect about $483 million more.\n\nThe federal changes also reduce the personal exemption that taxpayers can claim on their income taxes to zero. Schaufele said it's unclear whether this would eliminate Maryland's personal exemption. If it does, state revenues stand to gain another $1.2 billion.\n\nFor states expecting a financial boost from the federal changes, \"in the short run, it could turn out to be a great thing,\" said Blair-Stanek. \"But over the long run, it will definitely increase the pressure on state and local governments to reduce taxes, or at least rein in increases.\"\n\nMaryland lawmakers have promised to pass legislation protecting taxpayers from the increases by the time the state's 90-day General Assembly session ends in April.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said last week that he will introduce legislation allowing taxpayers to itemize deductions on their state returns even if they take the standard deduction on their federal returns.\n\n\"Under our proposed legislation, Marylanders will not pay one cent more in state taxes as a result of the actions at the federal level,\" he said.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly are joining with Hogan to clarify the law and eliminate any risk to the state personal exemption \u2014 and at the same time seizing an opportunity to criticize congressional Republicans and Trump.\n\n\"It's an economic war between the red states against the blue states,\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller.\n\nEven if so, the new federal tax code doesn't seem to be as accurate a weapon as feared.\n\nCorin Cates-Carney is Montana Public Radio's Capitol Bureau reporter.

That changed during the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\"I was going out into the field and covering a lot of Trump rallies and talking to people,\" Klepper says, \"and they were getting a lot of their ideas and their news from these far-right sources. So what first felt fringe, suddenly felt mainstream.\"\n\nToday those sites are required reading for Klepper's job. As the host of Comedy Central's satirical political show The Opposition, Klepper delivers commentaries in the persona of a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\n\"He creates his own reality,\" Klepper says of his character. \"He sees the two dots and he fills the spaces with the things that make him feel more comfortable.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn developing his character for The Opposition\n\nThe character that I play lives in this world of Alex Jones, but is not a one-to-one satirization of Alex Jones. We kind of wanted to create a character that stood alone from those characters. So it's got the paranoia and the opportunism of an Alex Jones; it's got the Trump support of a Sean Hannity. It feels like state-run media. It's got the snark and smarm of a Jesse Watters, and it's got a little bit of Midwestern Jordan Klepper in there as well.\n\nThe look that we've started to cultivate is less like \"I'm a New York guy with skinny ties and thin suits.\" ... These guys like to have flashier suits, bigger watches, big stripes and things of that nature. And so costume-wise we try to go in that direction. They sort of all preach the prosperity gospel; they're going to talk about God. But the best way to show that you are a person of God and living a righteous path is that you are successful. I think the Jordan Klepper character on the show wants to show he's successful in how he looks and how he holds himself.\n\nOn how he relates to the people he satirizes\n\nI don't want to overplay my hand as someone who has lived a really difficult, tough life. I've been very fortunate. I had a great upbringing. [But] trying to become a professional comedian had its toil. I didn't have a lot of successes. I had a lot of failures, and I think out of that comes this [insecurity of], \"Am I smart enough? Am I thoughtful enough?\" And I do think we're all dealing with those issues and we all have those fears deep down inside. ...\n\nWhen I look at these characters who might be more on the fringe, who I disagree with ideologically or the things that they're pushing, and I try to find what is really going on right there \u2014 \"Why are you pushing so hard against this anti-intellectualism? Why are you so angry?\" \u2014 it's like, I think I can relate to [you] because you are scared.\n\nOn how \"resistance\" is a theme for both the left and the right\n\nYou see the ideology that exists on these far fringier sites like Infowars and even Breitbart \u2014 they're not like traditional Republican ideologies. They're based in conflict and opposing the mainstream \u2014 anti-mainstream, anti-intellectualism, anti-fact in many ways.\n\nAs we wanted to build this show, we saw that, \"This is all opposing something. Find an enemy. Call it out. We want to be that.\" We also realized what was so interesting is [Jones] was calling himself \"the resistance\" at the same time Keith Olbermann had a show calling itself The Resistance, and it felt like a very American moment that we could all be united in being against something. We're all resisting something. We all want to be the underdogs.\n\nOn getting cast for The Daily Show over his wife and comedy partner, Laura Grey\n\nThey had us both audition and we went through a bunch of rounds. We both came in and read with Jon [Stewart] and they could only take one person, and I was the person who got that job, which was one of the weirdest, strangest, happiest, saddest moments of my life. ...\n\nWe had worked together for so long, worked on these projects and gotten so close to this really cool dream job \u2014 one which she was so perfect for, I felt I had a strong chance for. ... So I got to go along with it and she didn't and started working on other things. ...\n\nIt's kind of the truth of this industry. On the outside everything is a dream and you get to have dream jobs. And, again, I am so fortunate with the opportunities that I had, but up until that point, Laura and I had both been doing comedy for 15 years and we had some successes, but a lot of that was us making videos ourselves on no money, teaching improv 40 hours a week to try to get by, hustling, getting really close to opportunities and then failing. So this idea of this dream thing happening and everything is great is a fallacy. I think when I had that opportunity ... it was a mix of so many emotions.

With tax reform moving quickly through Congress, confidence in the strength of our economy remains high and families around the country are reaping the benefits. We're especially pleased to see the manufacturing sector roaring back to life, adding a total of 159,000 jobs since President Trump took office after averaging a loss of more than 1,000 jobs per month during the last year of the previous administration. As we continue to unleash the American economy from unnecessary regulation and taxes, we look forward to seeing more reports like this, showing a healthy and thriving jobs market for the American people.\"\n\n\u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nThe Labor Department reports that U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in November, somewhat better than analysts had been expecting. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1 percent. Job gains in manufacturing were especially strong with 31,000 added last month.\n\nThe president boasted about it on Twitter.\n\nIt's difficult to tie those gains directly to President Trump's economic vision, however. On average, employers have added 170,000 jobs in each of the 10 months since Trump took office. That's slightly below the 196,000 per month pace during the comparable period in 2016, under President Obama. If you throw out September of this year, when job gains were depressed by hurricanes, Trump's monthly average is closer to Obama's, at 185,000, but the change in administrations doesn't appear to have had much effect on the overall job market.\n\nThe job gains in November were widespread across industries and demographic groups.\n\n\"We're at that point in the cycle where the market is tight enough that it's really rewarding everybody,\" said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHe noted that unemployment among workers without a high school diploma fell by half a percentage point to 5.2 percent. And the jobless rate among Hispanics dipped to 4.7 percent, the lowest level on record.\n\n\"If we could sustain growth at this level for another couple of years then the amount of progress we could make on income inequality and wage growth for middle America would be maybe even unprecedented,\" Hassett said.\n\nDespite the tight labor market, though, wages have risen only modestly in the past year.\n\n\"Wage growth was not as strong as we'd like to see it,\" Hassett acknowledged. \"We fully expect that that's going to accelerate next year if the tax bill passes.\"\n\nTom Maher, who runs a Manpower temporary franchise in Dayton, Ohio, agreed that paychecks need to get bigger.\n\n\"Wages are rising, but they're not rising as fast as I believe they really should in order to attract the workers that they need,\" Maher said. \"Virtually every manufacturer in the area has a help-wanted sign outside their window.\"\n\nFactories nationwide have added 171,000 jobs so far in 2017 \u2014 a rebound from the previous year when factories shed 16,000 jobs. Trump has promised to lead a renaissance in American manufacturing. The sector has generally been adding jobs since 2010, although the strength of export-oriented factories is strongly tied to what's happening in the global economy.\n\nWith the unemployment rate hovering at its lowest level since 2000, a shortage of skilled workers could be a drag on future economic growth.\n\n\"There is some slack in the labor market,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. \"But there's a big question about whether that remaining slack in the labor market can be deployed.\"\n\n\"What I expect is we will start to see increasing labor shortages as we go into 2018. And at some point \u2014 and it may be late 2018, it may be mid 2019 \u2014 those labor shortages are going to really limit the ability we have to continue expanding.\"\n\nAt a White House Cabinet meeting this week, Trump said he wants to draw more people into the workforce.\n\n\"We're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working,\" Trump said. \"That pool is now coming back.\"\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, there are 95 million Americans 16 and older who are not working. But that figure includes retirees, students and voluntary stay-at-home parents. It's an open question how many might be lured into the workforce. Lower taxes might offer a carrot to would-be workers. The administration is also considering sticks \u2014 in the form of a less generous safety net.\n\n\"I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all,\" the president told supporters in Missouri last week. \"And the person who is not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his or her ass off. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen.\"\n\nThis week the Agriculture Department announced a push to limit the food stamp program \u2014 known as SNAP \u2014 in an effort to push more people into the workforce.\n\n\"SNAP was created to provide people with the help they need to feed themselves and their families, but it was not intended to be a permanent lifestyle,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \"We want to provide the nutrition people need, but we also want to help them transition from government programs back to work and into lives of independence.\"\n\nThe White House had telegraphed this move in May when the president unveiled a budget calling for cuts in food stamp spending.\n\n\"We need folks to work,\" White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at the time. \"We don't have enough money to take care of the people \u2014 everybody \u2014 who doesn't need help.\"\n\nAs of August, there were more than 41 million Americans receiving food stamps. Advocates for the program note that the government already requires able-bodied adults without children to find work within three months to collect benefits.\n\nTrump also boasted this week about the rising stock market.\n\n\"We have a stock market that has hit record highs 81 times since our election victory,\" he told Cabinet members. \"It's at a new high right now.\"\n\nThe S&P 500-stock index has risen more than 23 percent since Election Day last year. Along with a rising real estate market, that's helped to push the nation's total household wealth to $96.9 trillion. However, as NPR noted last spring, only about half the people in the country own stocks either directly or through retirement accounts.\n\n\"You could argue that there's a trickle-down effect,\" said KPMG's Hunter, \"but actual evidence of that meaningfully changing people's lives over the long term seems to be de minimis.\"", "keywords": ["working", "workers", "market", "need", "trump", "white", "stocks", "fact", "record", "check", "work", "labor", "trumps", "president", "jobs"], "polarity": 0.13331213924963922, "subjectivity": 0.37007835046897536},

David Schweikert, R-Ariz., and member of the Freedom Caucus, about the White House immigration framework and infrastructure plan ahead of President Trump's first State of the Union address.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nThroughout the show, we will hear both Republicans and Democrats explain what they want to hear from the president tonight. Our next guest is Congressman Dave Schweikert. He's a Republican from Arizona. He's a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, and he is on the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nWelcome to the show.\n\nDAVE SCHWEIKERT: Oh, thank you for having me.\n\nMCEVERS: Let's start with immigration. What do you want to hear from the president tonight in terms of immigration policy?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: I'm hoping, actually, a few sentences on the willingness to work on a framework that both deals with everything from DACA to actually a more talent-based system. As you know, we have a demographic difficulty, if not crisis, in the United States. Our birthrates have collapsed. So how do you do a combination of saying, we want an immigration system that I don't care what color you are, what gender you are; what I care about is the talents you bring to the country?\n\nAnd I think that's actually a much more honest, egalitarian model than one that sort of picks, saying, because you have family members, you get certain benefits; if you happen to win a lottery, you get certain benefits; if you're of a certain population, you get certain benefits. All those sort of choose instead of something that sort of treats everyone fairly.\n\nMCEVERS: Would that package include a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: I think, actually, if you normalize populations, there's - always has to be some mechanisms in there, but you never, ever want to sort of create a disincentive for the folks who've followed the rules. Let's say you took DACA populations and said, hey, we're going to normalize your status, and then we're going to allow under the new, refined rule sets that you can actually pursue citizenship if that's what you choose. But here's the path everyone gets to use. So it's sort of egalitarian. Everyone gets treated same.\n\nMCEVERS: I want to talk about infrastructure, as well. The president has, in the past, talked about a $1 trillion infrastructure program. Members of the Freedom Caucus, which you are one, have been concerned about the deficit. For instance, the tax law is to add more than $1.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Does the infrastructure plan worry you on the same grounds?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: Infrastructure should be bipartisan. Making the dollars work is Congress' obligation. Be creative. Create dozens of different revenue streams, and make it more efficient to be able to get needed projects and needed repairs out of the ground faster and more efficiently.\n\nMCEVERS: When you talked about dozens of revenue streams, what would those be?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: Everything from selling excess assets, certain energy leases - could you pledge that energy lease? There's lots of examples like that where if you design a mechanism where the benefits of such things go to infrastructure instead of get washed through the general fund, I think it actually makes it easier to move those projects forward.\n\nMCEVERS: You know, both Democrats and Republicans say they want changes to immigration and infrastructure. You know, is there enough overlap here to get bills passed on these issues?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: Oh, absolutely. This is going to be a fascinating thing for the president. Can he give an optimistic tone and move that into the ability to work on immigration, the ability to work on infrastructure and the dozens of other major policies? The hard part is, I think our political bases are so polarized that when there's a perception that a Democrat is working with me, as a more conservative Republican, they get beaten up, and that incentive of - to work with each other is now been taken away by sort of to say the radicalization of our base.\n\nMCEVERS: The State of the Union's supposed to be this time for the president to really set his agenda and his message for the year ahead. President Trump, we have seen, you know, will seem to support one position in conversations with lawmakers and then later criticize that position on Twitter and put forward another one. Does that make your job more difficult?\n\nSCHWEIKERT: In some ways, it does. A twitter post can never capture the complications in complex public policy. It can spark a conversation, but it becomes fairly hollow when you realize many of the things we have to do are complex.\n\nMCEVERS: Congressman Dave Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, thank you so much.\n\nSCHWEIKERT: No, thank you for having me.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Its economy is booming. And Brown touted a list of bipartisan accomplishments: a pension overhaul, a new budget reserve, and an extension of the state's cap-and-trade program to combat climate change.\n\n\"Their passage demonstrates that some American governments can actually get things done, even in the face of deepening partisan division,\" the governor said, taking a shot at Congress.\n\nHe is California's longest-serving governor, a three-time Democratic presidential candidate, and a one-of-a-kind American politician. And Thursday's Assembly speech was his final State of the State address.\n\nHe told lawmakers that California is prospering and laid out a path for the state to continue its progress \u2014 but issued dire warnings on a global scale.\n\nOur world, our way of life, our system of governance \u2014 all are at immediate and genuine risk. Endless new weapons systems, growing antagonism among nations, the poison in our politics, climate change. All of this calls out fo courage, for imagination and for generous dialogue.\n\nAs he looked ahead to his 16th and final year at the helm, Brown called for fresh looks at California's criminal justice system, which has ballooned over the last half-century; and how the state manages its forests to reduce the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe governor also made the case for the transportation funding law he signed last year, which voters will likely decide the fate of in November.\n\n\"Fighting a gas tax may appear to be good politics, but it isn't. I will do everything in my power to defeat any repeal effort that may make it to the ballot. You can count on that!\" Brown said, drawing applause from Democrats while Republicans sat on their hands.\n\nHe also continued his unflagging support of two signature infrastructure projects: the Delta tunnels and high-speed rail.\n\n\"Yes, there are critics, there are lawsuits and there are countless obstacles,\" he said. \"But California was built on dreams and perseverance and the bolder path is still our way forward.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nBut even many Democrats struggle with these projects' costs. And Republicans blame Sacramento Democrats \u2014 including Brown \u2014 for California's skyrocketing cost of housing and other vital expenses.\n\nAssembly GOP Leader Brian Dahle, who represents rural northeastern California, talked about the challenges facing his neighbor, a single mother of four.\n\n\"Her cost of living is going up,\" he said after the speech. \"They just passed a gas tax last year; that drives up her transportation costs. Energy costs are going up. And she has to decide whether she's going to put food on the table, turn the heat up.\"\n\nDahle said small businesses like his are \"dying of a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThursday's was not a speech that railed against President Trump or sought to fire up \"the resistance.\" Brown did not mention Trump by name, though he acknowledged the president for approving federal funds to fight wildfires.\n\nAnd despite threats from the Trump administration to arrest state and local politicians who defy federal immigration laws, the governor \u2014 who just months ago signed California's \"sanctuary state\" law \u2014 skipped the subject entirely.\n\nThat didn't trouble legislative Democrats like Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\n\n\"What a lot of us have come to understand,\" Rendon said afterwards, \"is that the best way we can fight against Donald Trump \u2014 the best way we can fight against everything that's happening in Washington, DC \u2014 is to be successful.\"\n\nInstead of dwelling on the president, Brown went global, noting that the Doomsday Clock had just moved the minute hand to 11:58 \u2014 as close as it's been to midnight since the height of the Cold War.\n\n\"Our world, our way of life, our system of governance \u2014 all are at immediate and genuine risk,\" the governor said. \"Endless new weapons systems, growing antagonism among nations, the poison in our politics, climate change.

And he managed to snag a rather high-profile guest: Barack Obama.\n\nThe full audio of the interview is available here for the next six days. The interview was taped in September during the Invictus Games in Toronto, an event created by Harry for wounded, injured or ill servicemen and veterans.\n\nThe conversation is billed as the first interview with the former president since leaving the White House, and it's not exactly hard-hitting.\n\nBut it does offer a window into Obama's life now: still driven by purpose, but with less adrenalin and more leisurely breakfasts.\n\n\"I didn't used to experience traffic,\" Obama says. \"I used to cause traffic.\"\n\nThe transition of power\n\nLeaving the White House after the inauguration, Obama says, his first thought was gratitude for his wife, Michelle.\n\n\"She is not someone who was naturally inclined to politics, so in some ways, despite the fact that she was as good of a first lady as there's ever been, she did this largely in support of my decision to run,\" Obama says.\n\n\"For us to be able to come out of that intact, that our marriage was strong, that we're still each other's best friends, our daughters turning into amazing young women ... that we had done the work in a way that preserved our integrity and left us whole\" was a satisfying feeling, Obama says.\n\nThe former president doesn't mention Donald Trump by name but does acknowledge some worries as he left office.\n\n\"That [feeling of satisfaction] was mixed with all the work that was still undone, and concerns about how the country moves foward,\" he says. \"But overall, there was a serenity there. More than I expected.\"\n\nAdjusting to a different pace\n\nObama says it was \"strange good fortune\" that he and Michelle were in their 40s before being in the public eye. The result was that when his presidency came to an end, his entire identity wasn't wrapped up in the position.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about leaving the presidency is realizing that my life had been so accelerated,\" he says. \"Everything felt like, and still feels to some degree, like it's moving in slow motion.\"\n\nHe describes the sense that important things need to be done immediately, because \"where I'm from 'right away' means if we don't do something in half an hour somebody dies.\"\n\nGetting used to a slower pace means \"you don't have the same adrenaline rush, but it also means that you can be I think more reflective and deliberate about the kinds of things you want to get done.\"\n\n\"The fact that I can wake up and if I want to spend an extra 45 minutes talking to Michelle and take a long breakfast \u2014 I can do it,\" he says. \"That feels great.\"\n\nHe says he is now \"obsessed with training the next generation of leaders\" and that he is transitioning into being a coach rather than a player.\n\nThe impact of social media\n\nPrince Harry notes that trolling, extremism, fake news and cyberbullying have become major issues and asks Obama whether there are things he wishes he had done on those issues.\n\n\"[The] question I think really has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a balkanization of our society, but rather continues to promote ways of finding common ground,\" Obama says. \"I'm not sure government can legislate that, but what I do believe is that all of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can re-create common space on the Internet.\"\n\nBack when there were just three TV stations, Obama says, \"everybody had a common set of facts.\"\n\n\"There might be conservatives or liberals, but people generally could agree on a baseline of reality. One of the dangers of the Internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can just be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.\"\n\nHe says one thing he discovered during his campaign in 2007 and 2008 was the importance of bringing online communities offline.\n\n\"Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interest to convene,\" he says, \"but then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighborhood, and get to know each other. Because the truth is, on the Internet, everything is simplified. And when you meet people face to face, it turns out they're complicated.\"\n\n\"It's also, by the way, hard to be as obnoxious and cruel in person as people can be anonymously on the Internet,\" Obama adds.\n\nObama as royal wedding guest\n\nObama and Harry were quite chummy during the interview, but one subject didn't come up: whether the former president will be invited to the prince's wedding, scheduled for May 19 at Windsor Castle.\n\nSome in the U.K. press have speculated that inviting the Obamas could complicate the British government's relations with Trump.\n\nThe BBC posed the question of whether Obama will be invited to Harry himself, who demurred.\n\n\"We haven't put the invites or the guest list together yet, so who knows whether he's going to be invited or not,\" Harry replied. \"Wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\"", "keywords": ["ways", "prince", "way", "things", "white", "meet", "harry", "house", "used", "interview", "common", "barack", "tells", "met", "obama", "life"], "polarity": 0.06938657407407409, "subjectivity": 0.417636684303351},

It is a tradition that dates back to the Coolidge administration in the 1920s and was President Trump's and first lady Melania Trump's first time taking part in the event since moving into the White House.\n\nThe ceremony comes a day after the president reiterated a pledge he's echoed many times since becoming a candidate in 2015 to end the so-called war on Christmas. At a speech Wednesday in Missouri to publicize the GOP tax overhaul expected to come up for a vote in the Senate this week, President Trump kicked off his remarks by saying: \"I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?\"\n\nHere's a closer look at the president's claim.\n\nCLAIM: President Trump will return the phrase Merry Christmas to the White House\n\n\"With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut.\"\n\nWhile it is still unclear if congressional Republicans can deliver that tax overhaul Trump is so eager to sign into law, checking to see if \"Merry Christmas\" actually left presidential vernacular is a bit easier to answer.\n\nFirst a little context.\n\nPresident Trump's charge that \"you don't see Merry Christmas anymore\" appeared to be directed at his predecessor former President Barack Obama and the apparent claim that Obama seemed to favor the more inclusive seasonal phrase \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\nSome of those who share President Trump's view of the previous administration point to the Obama White House's official holiday cards that read \"Happy Holidays.\" Former Rep. Joe Walsh, who is now a conservative pundit, tweeted Wednesday:\n\n\"The Trump family's first Christmas card contains a word that was noticeably absent from all eight of Obama's Christmas cards: CHRISTMAS!\"\n\nTodd Starnes of Fox News earlier this week penned an article thanking Trump for bringing \"Merry Christmas\" back to the White House.\n\nBut a quick search of the Web and social media returns many examples of when Obama used the phrase \"Merry Christmas.\" In fact, in his weekly address on Christmas Eve 2016, literally the first words out of the former president's mouth were: \"Merry Christmas, everybody.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama in 2016 YouTube\n\nHere are tweeted photos from the prior years:\n\nIn 2015, Obama tweeted \"Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and yours.\"\n\nIn 2014, Obama tweeted \"Have a merry Christmas.\"\n\nAnd in 2013, Obama went with a simple \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\nAs one journalist pointed out on social media this week, the Obama administration said \"Merry Christmas\" annually for eight years.\n\nWell, perhaps Trump was suggesting the George W.

Nope, that administration did so too, including in 2008 when former President Bush spoke to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.\n\nHow about the Clinton administration?

And for state government coffers, the Republican-led overhaul may not cut as cleanly along ideological lines as Democrats say.\n\nMontana\n\nTake Montana, which Donald Trump won by 20 points. The state Legislature is dominated by Republicans who are championing the new federal tax law as nothing but good news for the state.\n\nBut Montana's governor, Democrat Steve Bullock, warns the tax changes could pose a threat to his state's finances.\n\n\"This is a bad deal for Montana and for families all across the country,\" Bullock wrote in a tweet soon after Congress passed the tax overhaul.\n\nThis month, the head of the governor's budgeting office announced the state could expect to lose $20 million in revenue over the next two years, mainly because of how the federal law changes the way Montana collects corporate income tax.\n\nAnd $20 million is on the low end of projections by state economists.\n\n\"With experts on both sides, we thought it appropriate to err on the side of less loss to state revenue, because that was really the legislative intent in Congress,\" Montana State Budget Director Dan Villa said. \"It was not the intent to have that implication come down on the state.\"\n\nMontana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas says the analysis by the governor's office is nothing but politics.\n\n\"We don't see any impact except positive impacts,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Montana Legislature meets once every two years, and there are no plans to call a special session to deal with the disagreement over projections. Although, state lawmakers could be called back into session if consensus grows around a loss more than the governor's estimate of $20 million.\n\nNotably, the Montana Department of Revenue suggests it could be more than double that. Director Mike Kadas, a Bullock appointee, cites the fact that Montana is one of 17 states coupling their tax code with federal law in a way that could result in a loss in personal and corporate income tax.\n\nHow Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law How Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law Listen \u00b7 10:25 10:25\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland is not one of those 17. The Mid-Atlantic, left-leaning state is expecting a windfall from the Republican-led update to the federal tax code.\n\nThe state comptroller's office expects a boost to state and local income tax revenue of at least $300 million in a single year, unless the state General Assembly acts to prevent it.\n\nMaryland's tax code is more directly coupled with the federal code, so Maryland taxpayers can take most of the same deductions on their federal and state tax returns.\n\n\"It's a very sensible choice that almost all states have made, basically to allow taxpayers who have calculated their taxes for the federal purposes just to take those same calculations, make just a couple of tweaks to figure out how much they owe the state,\" said Andrew Blair-Stanek, a tax specialist who teaches at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n\nThis is intended to simplify the tax-filing process for residents, as well as enforcement for the state. But it also means taxpayers can only deduct something from their state taxes if they have already deducted it from their federal taxes.\n\nThe new federal law increases the standard deduction while limiting some previous deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes. As a result, roughly 700,000 Maryland residents who itemized deductions on their past tax returns will shrink their federal tax bills if they switch to the standard deduction, said Andrew Schaufele, director of the state Bureau of Revenue Estimates in the comptroller's office.\n\nBut if all 700,000 take the standard deduction on both their federal and state tax returns, the state is expected to collect about $483 million more.\n\nThe federal changes also reduce the personal exemption that taxpayers can claim on their income taxes to zero. Schaufele said it's unclear whether this would eliminate Maryland's personal exemption. If it does, state revenues stand to gain another $1.2 billion.\n\nFor states expecting a financial boost from the federal changes, \"in the short run, it could turn out to be a great thing,\" said Blair-Stanek. \"But over the long run, it will definitely increase the pressure on state and local governments to reduce taxes, or at least rein in increases.\"\n\nMaryland lawmakers have promised to pass legislation protecting taxpayers from the increases by the time the state's 90-day General Assembly session ends in April.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said last week that he will introduce legislation allowing taxpayers to itemize deductions on their state returns even if they take the standard deduction on their federal returns.\n\n\"Under our proposed legislation, Marylanders will not pay one cent more in state taxes as a result of the actions at the federal level,\" he said.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly are joining with Hogan to clarify the law and eliminate any risk to the state personal exemption \u2014 and at the same time seizing an opportunity to criticize congressional Republicans and Trump.\n\n\"It's an economic war between the red states against the blue states,\" said Senate President Thomas V.

The group's deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, claims they show Muslims beating non-Muslims. The three that Trump shared were titled \"Muslim migrant beats up Dutch Boy on crutches!\" and \"Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary!\" and \"Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!\"\n\nThe provenance of the videos is not clear. But at least one of the three, which purported to show a Muslim migrant beating a Dutch citizen, was debunked. The Netherlands Embassy says the perpetrator was, in fact, a Dutch citizen who was convicted.\n\nFransen was convicted in Britain in November 2016 of religiously aggravated harassment after abusing a woman wearing a hijab. Earlier this month, she was charged with using \"threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior\" after a speech she made in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nShe appeared to be ecstatic over Trump's retweets, proclaiming in all caps, \"THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP, HAS RETWEETED THREE OF DEPUTY LEADER JAYDA FRANSEN'S TWITTER VIDEOS!

He also spoke more generally about his record during his first year in office. \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocious way,\" Trump said. \"There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at some of the president's claims.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is primarily aimed at workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder.\n\n\"Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,\" Trump said. \"The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe fitters. The people that like me best.\"\n\nSome elements of the GOP plan would benefit such workers, including a larger standard deduction and an expanded child tax credit. But blue-collar workers are hardly the bill's main focus. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, less than 20 percent of the total tax savings in 2019 would go to workers making $87,400 or less (the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution). These workers fare even worse after 2025, when the individual tax cuts in the Senate bill are set to expire. By 2027, people making less than $54,700 would see a tax increase under the Senate bill, while those making between $54,700 and $93,200 would see a modest cut, accounting for less than 3 percent of the bill's total tax savings.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is hard on rich people, like President Trump.\n\n\"This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me. This is not good for me,\" Trump said. \"I have some very wealthy friends, not so happy with me. But that's OK.\"\n\nUpper-income taxpayers would be the biggest beneficiaries of the GOP plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and to lower taxes on so-called pass-through companies, which are taxed at the individual rate. They would also benefit from elimination of the alternative minimum tax and their heirs would benefit from a higher threshold on the inheritance tax. According to the Tax Policy Center, 63 percent of the total savings from the Senate bill in 2019 would go to taxpayers earning more than $150,100 (the top 20 percent of earners), while nearly a quarter would go to the top 5 percent \u2014 people making upwards of $303,200.\n\nTop earners do even better after 2025, when the individual tax cuts expire but other provisions continue. By 2027, 90 percent of the total tax savings go to people making more than $154,900 (the top 20 percent of earners) and nearly 62 percent go to the top 1 percent \u2014 people making more than $912,100.\n\nCLAIM: Job growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"We've created nearly 2 million jobs,\" Trump said. \"Think of it. We used to lose millions. Now we've created 2 million jobs since I won the election.\"\n\nThe U.S. job market continues to improve, with unemployment in October falling to its lowest level in 17 years. (November job numbers will be out next week.) Since February \u2014 Trump's first full month in office \u2014 U.S. employers have added an average of 169,000 jobs each month. This is slightly below the pace of 199,000 jobs per month during the comparable period in 2016.\n\nCLAIM: Economic growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"The Commerce Department announced this morning that our GDP, that's the big one, in the third quarter, grew even faster than they reported previously,\" Trump said. \"Now it comes in at 3.3 percent, which is the largest increase in many years. And if we didn't have the hurricanes, we would have been at 4 percent.\"\n\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is the broadest estimate of the U.S. economy, and the Commerce Department did say Wednesday that GDP grew at 3.3 percent between July and September \u2014 an upward revision from the department's earlier estimate. The last time GDP grew that rapidly was in 2014. Forecasters anticipate somewhat slower growth in the last three months of the year. Macroeconomic Advisers, for example, is predicting fourth-quarter growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nAnalysts originally expected that a spate of hurricanes would temporarily depress growth in the third quarter, but that didn't happen. In fact, by closing ports, the storms may have slowed imports and temporarily boosted GDP.\n\nCLAIM: Speaking of hurricanes ...\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged that Puerto Rico has not bounced back as quickly from storm damage as Texas and Florida.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has been a very tough situation because of the fact that it was in very, very bad shape before the storms ever hit,\" the president said. \"But they're doing well there and it's healing and it's getting better. And we're getting them power and all of the things they have to have.\"\n\nConditions in Puerto Rico have slowly improved since Hurricane Maria struck more than two months ago.

The hotel developers \u2014 including a little-known company called Bayrock Group \u2014 suddenly owned an American historic site.\n\nChurch archivist David Pultz says Bayrock officials stalled DNA testing for years. \"My suspicion was they were trying to avoid controversy\" that might bring more scrutiny, he said.\n\nEmbedded Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Listen \u00b7 43:18 43:18\n\nA hotel behind veils\n\nIn fact, at Trump SoHo, a lot remains unknown, including the project's true source of funding.\n\nBut now the man whose name brands the hotel \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 lives in the White House. And his financial ties reportedly are being investigated by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller in connection with a larger probe into possible ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials.\n\nNote this: In a lawsuit, Bayrock's former finance director Jody Kriss portrays the firm as a money-laundering operation, used to conceal transfers of illicit funds and disguise them as legitimate real estate transactions. He also alleges that cash infusions from overseas were fraudulently portrayed as loans to help the firm's principals evade taxes.\n\n\"Tax evasion and money laundering are the core of Bayrock's business model,\" the lawsuit alleges. And the Trump SoHo building, it said, was \"a monument to spectacularly corrupt money-laundering and tax evasion.\"\n\nBayrock has denied money-laundering allegations; the company's spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. The White House referred all questions about Trump SoHo to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n\nMueller's team reportedly is specifically looking into money laundering in New York City real estate. That investigation \u2014 along with the discovery process of various lawsuits \u2014 may help uncover information about the business back story of the man whom Americans have elected president.\n\nAnd the NPR podcast Embedded also has been digging around, trying to understand more about one Trump signature project. Here's what the reporters learned.\n\nHow it all started\n\nWith much fanfare, Trump announced the project on his TV show, The Apprentice, in 2006.\n\nThroughout the years, the project kept making news, what with the bones, a heated standoff with the neighborhood and the grisly death of a construction worker. And lawsuits started to hit, alleging fraud and shady financing.\n\nDonald Trump announces Trump SoHo on the Apprentice in 2006. YouTube\n\nThe early zoning battles set the tone: Residential properties weren't allowed in the neighborhood where the property was proposed. Local activists confidently predicted zoning problems would kill the 46-story project. But city officials allowed the building to go up as a condo-hotel hybrid.\n\nUnits were sold like condos, but owners could stay only a few weeks at a time, totaling about four months annually. For Trump, it was a licensing deal: The developer would get use of Trump's name, and Trump would get fees for managing the building. And in a legal deposition, Trump said he also got an 18 percent equity share of the building.\n\nIn a New York magazine article, Trump says the idea for the Trump SoHo was presented to him as \"a complete proposal\" by one of the two developers, Bayrock and the Sapir Organization. The former had been launched several years earlier by two Soviet-born immigrants, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater. The latter was part of a New York real-estate empire started by Soviet-born financier Tamir Sapir and his son Alex.\n\n\"Only ... cash deals\"\n\nAs it turned out, selling the New York condo-hotel to U.S.-based buyers was tough; the \"non-residential\" designation meant they couldn't qualify for mortgages, says Ruedi Sieber, a broker who at the time worked for a firm selling the Trump SoHo units.\n\n\"You could only do cash deals,\" Sieber said. \"So unless the guy had a million and a half in cash to purchase the property, he couldn't buy it because no bank would give you a loan.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump SoHo sales went a lot better with wealthy buyers in Latin America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. The pitch was simple, Sieber says: You could own a piece of real estate in Manhattan, with views of the Hudson River with five-star service. Trump's Apprentice fame helped.\n\nCondo buyers take SoHo to court\n\nBut then, the Great Recession hit New York real estate hard, and some of the Trump SoHo's condo buyers began getting cold feet. They turned to Manhattan attorney Adam Bailey to try to get back their money.\n\nAs Bailey investigated, he and his team zeroed in on the way the Trump SoHo was marketed as almost sold-out.\n\nIn media interviews, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., \"a Trump representative\" and other officials had been saying that 60 percent or \"more than half\" of the building's units were already sold.\n\nBut documents found by Bailey's team indicated the total sold was not quite 16 percent. \"I'm like, 'This is fraud. Done,' \" he said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAs Bailey pursued his civil suit, he also sent evidence of possible criminal issues to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.'s office. He says prosecutors there were \"very interested\" and \"started working on it.\"\n\nWith that investigation going on, the developers and Trump \u2014 who has long boasted that he never settles lawsuits \u2014 agreed to settle Bailey's case, refunding the buyers 90 percent of their money and paying legal fees, but without admitting any wrongdoing. Bailey and his clients signed a nondisclosure agreement barring them from discussing any evidence of criminal fraud.\n\nCriminal case goes away\n\nWithout cooperating witnesses, Vance dropped the criminal case. A recent investigative series by WNYC-FM, ProPublica and The New Yorker said some prosecutors in Vance's office wanted to proceed with the case but were blocked by Vance.\n\nThe news stories also indicated that Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz had made two five-figure donations to Vance's campaign in 2012: one that Vance received and soon returned before dropping the case; another one Vance received, and also returned, after the case was already dropped. Vance has publicly insisted he dropped the case only because the evidence was insufficient.\n\nWho funded this project?\n\nIf it had gone forward, the investigation might have provided some answers to questions \u2014 such as, why did Trump, who'd had a string of bankruptcies, suddenly get a generous offer from Bayrock?\n\nIn a legal deposition, Trump once tried to explain it: \"We had a tenant in the building, in Trump Tower, called Bayrock, and Bayrock was interested in getting us into deals and we \u2014 somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure \u2014came to see \u2014 either myself or one of my children ... about doing this job.\"\n\nThe \"job\" required no investment from Trump, but could potentially funnel millions his way for the use of his gilded brand name. Trump agreed to it: The Trump Organization would collect fees for managing the building, and son Donald Jr. and daughter Ivanka would manage the marketing and sale of its residences.\n\nWhat was Bayrock?\n\nToday, the history of the financing and construction of Trump SoHo is reportedly one of the subjects under investigation by Mueller.\n\nThe SoHo deal may help explain possible financial ties connecting Trump to Russian associates involved with Bayrock, founded by the Soviet-born financier Arif, who acquired a chromium plant in Kazakhstan and became one of the country's wealthiest men.\n\nAt his side was Sater, born in Moscow, raised in Brooklyn and known for a checkered past. In the 1990s, he did time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken glass during a bar fight, and later pleaded guilty in connection with a securities fraud scheme, which allegedly was aided by the Italian Mafia.\n\nBut Sater would also become a valuable cooperating witness for the U.S. government, helping it convict mob figures for financial-fraud crimes and even earning praise from Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nIn various legal depositions involving Bayrock, Sater was usually described as someone whose job was to raise money for the company.\n\nTo build the Trump SoHo, Bayrock would team up with Alex Sapir, the son of billionaire Tamir Sapir, who was born in the Soviet republic of Georgia and grew rich in the fertilizer and oil businesses \u2014 and later in New York real estate deals. (The senior Sapir died in 2014).\n\ntoggle caption Mark Von Holden/WireImage/Getty\n\nToday, much of what's known about Bayrock and its financing comes from various lawsuits filed against the firm. One suit was filed by the former finance director Kriss, who joined the firm around 2001. His suit claims he was owed money by his former company, which he describes as \"spectacularly corrupt,\" running on cash infusions from overseas and dodging taxes. Bayrock and Kriss are currently in settlement talks.\n\nSater did not return requests for comment, and his attorney said the Kriss lawsuit was meritless.\n\nHow much did Trump know?\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2007, the New York Times published an article that detailed Sater's criminal past, as spelled out in a then-sealed criminal complaint. Sater said he was a changed man, telling the Times, \"I am not proud of some of the things that happened in my twenties. I'm proud of the things I am doing now.\"\n\nThe article would raise legal questions for Trump. When a principal at a firm has a felony conviction, investors are supposed to be told about it.\n\nTrump told the Times he knew little about Sater. \"We never knew that,\" he said about the report of Sater's financial crimes. \"We do as much of a background check as we can on the principals. I didn't really know him well,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Trump told the BBC, \"We were not the developer there. It was a licensing deal... a very simple licensing deal ... You're telling me things that I don't even know about.\" As the interviewer followed up with more questions, Trump abruptly stood up to leave.\n\nThe BBC's John Sweeney asked Donald Trump about Felix Sater in 2013. YouTube\n\nTrump's effort to portray himself as barely involved with the Trump SoHo has been challenged over the years. \"Donald was always in charge,\" Kriss recently told Bloomberg. \"Donald had to agree to every term of every deal and had to sign off on everything.\"\n\nLikewise, questions have been raised about Trump's claim that he barely knew Sater.\n\nIn a lawsuit deposition in 2007, Sater testified that he knew Trump, and when asked whether he had ever been in Trump's office alone with him, Sater replied, \"numerous times.\"\n\nIn 2010, long after the Times article, Sater was passing out business cards identifying himself as \"a senior adviser to Donald Trump.\" In a 2016 interview with a Russian publication, Sater spoke about being Trump's adviser until about 2011, saying he \"reported everything\" to Trump, \"sometimes twice a day, sometimes twice a week, sometimes twice a month. And like that, for 10 years.\"\n\nIn 2015, Sater sent an email to Trump attorney Michael Cohen boasting of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and proposing a new Trump real estate deal to highlight the candidate's negotiating skills, the New York Times reported. \"Our boy can become president of the United States, and we can engineer it,\" Sater wrote.\n\nTo Bloomberg reporter Tim O'Brien, who has written extensively about Trump, Sater's apparent proximity to the president raises important issues.\n\n\"The question that hangs over all this for me is, why is Donald Trump associating with someone like this?\" he asks. \"And why is he still in Trump's orbit after he got elected?\"\n\nSomewhere deep inside the history of Trump SoHo, those answers may still be buried.\n\nNPR's Chris Benderev, Kelly McEvers, Marilyn Geewax, Investigations research librarian Barbara Van Woerkom and Business Desk intern Mollie Simon contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["bayrock", "glass", "wrapped", "trump", "real", "estate", "hiding", "soho", "shiny", "york", "mysteries", "donald", "hotel", "trumps", "case", "sater"], "polarity": 0.009672587066204096, "subjectivity": 0.4216862137074903},

The White House released a one-page proposal. A senior White House official calls the new immigration plan, quote, \"a bipartisan compromise position.\" Well, it is already attracting a lot of bipartisan criticism. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here to walk through all the latest on immigration. Hey, Scott.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there.\n\nKELLY: Before we get to the criticism, let's lay out what is being criticized - quick recap of what the White House is proposing.\n\nDETROW: So the White House is taking a step toward the Democratic position on this. On one issue, they support a 10- to 12-year path to citizenship for people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program but also people who would be eligible for the program but aren't in it. So we're talking about 1.8 million people here.\n\nKELLY: All right.\n\nDETROW: But they want a lot in exchange for that - $25 billion for construction of a wall and other border security, additional money for immigration personnel on top of that. And then they want changes to the legal immigration system. They want to limit family considerations when visas are awarded to just parents and children who are minors, and they also want to completely end the visa lottery system.\n\nKELLY: So a lot to unpack in this plan, and we mentioned it is already coming in for a lot of criticism. Start with Democrats. How - what's the reaction been there?\n\nDETROW: They do not quite view this as the compromise that the White House is framing it as.\n\nKELLY: OK.\n\nDETROW: I'll read you a couple quotes here. And I should point out this came out yesterday after Congress left town, so most of the reaction so far has been on Twitter, in statements, things like that. So here's Joe Crowley, who's part of House Democratic leadership. This isn't an immigration proposal. It's a ransom note. And here's House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. She says this is, quote, \"an anti-immigrant framework\" and, quote, \"part of the Trump administration's unmistakable campaign to make America white again.\"\n\nA lot of similar responses, and I think it just comes down to the fact that President Trump's shifting positions on immigration and also the rhetoric he's used from the campaign through his presidency, notably the slur he used in that infamous moment in the White House a couple weeks ago talking about African countries. Democrats just don't see him as trustworthy, and they don't view his motives - they're incredibly suspicious of his motives on the issue of immigration.\n\nKELLY: Not a huge surprise that Democrats are not onboard with this plan or at least not yet. Are Republicans any more receptive?\n\nDETROW: Well, a lot of key Republicans are. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton is someone who's long been pushing for these changes to legal immigration that are included in this framework. He said in a statement that this plan is generous and humane while also being responsible. If you look at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement, he seems to mostly be just grateful that President Trump is finally putting his views on paper. McConnell's been trying to negotiate this as Trump has shifted from position to position. And McConnell's response bubbles down to, thank you for saying this; now we'll work on it. But here's what's important. House Republicans...\n\nKELLY: I was going to ask. That's the Senate side. What about on the House?\n\nDETROW: And they are the majority in the House...\n\nKELLY: Right.\n\nDETROW: ...Just like they are in the Senate. A lot of House Republicans are - real hard-line positions on immigration. And there's a lot of skepticism, especially from the Freedom Caucus part of the world, who view any sort of path to citizenship as amnesty. So the key to getting them onboard is how much President Trump sells this, how much he sticks to this plan. So if he comes out in the State of the Union next week and says, this is what I want, they could come around. Otherwise, they might remain critical to this.\n\nKELLY: NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Thank you, Scott.\n\nDETROW: Thank you.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

But this fall he received a letter from his insurer explaining that the cost of his policy's premium would jump from $800 a month to $1,300 in 2018.\n\nPremiums have risen for many 2018 policies, though most people won't actually have to swallow those higher costs, because subsidies have gone up, too. Gene Kern is one of the exceptions.\n\n\"Because of my income, I am slightly above the 400 percent poverty level,\" he says, \"and as a result I get no subsidy from the government.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Selena Simmons-Duffin / WAMU Selena Simmons-Duffin / WAMU\n\nSo Kern has switched to an HMO plan on the insurance exchange for around $900 a month. That's more than 20 percent of his income, which comes partly from Social Security and partly from his retirement account. But, he says, \"It's the best I can get,\" and he wants very much to stay insured for the next two years, at which point he will qualify for Medicare.\n\nLouise Norris is a health insurance broker and analyst in Colorado. She says there are a number of people like Kern who earn too much for a subsidy and will pay more for health insurance next year than they did in 2017. \"Rates are high,\" she says. \"There's no way to sugarcoat that.\"\n\nBut she warns her clients against the temptation to get a less expensive plan that doesn't comply with the minimum standards set out by the ACA.\n\n\"It seems like a good deal because it's cheap,\" Norris says. \"But then you find yourself being that person who has a heart attack and needs triple bypass. And hundreds of thousands of dollars later you wish you had that ACA-compliant plan.\"\n\nPrices for ACA-compliant health policies went up in Tennessee, too, where state regulators approved average rate increases ranging from 20 to 40 percent.\n\nBrenda Linn has already been paying $750 a month just to cover her own medical needs; so the retired kindergarten teacher and her husband logged on to HealthCare.gov to check the price of 2018 plans. To her surprise, the website brought up a great deal.\n\n\"And I'm like, 'Dave, this has to be a mistake,' \" she says. The price Linn was quoted was less than $5 a month. Why? A slight loss of income had made her eligible for a subsidy for 2018. \"Because we didn't qualify last year, I wasn't really that hopeful,\" Linn says.\n\nBut a large majority of marketplace shoppers do get subsidies. And for 2018, on aggregate, these subsidies are larger.\n\nTony Garr, a volunteer application assistant with the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, says more than ever this year, people should shop around on the exchange to see what kind of subsidies they may be eligible for.\n\n\"Generally speaking, they will find out that help is there,\" he says.\n\nAny many people who got a price break in the way of a subsidy in the past can get even more for their money this year.\n\nFor example, Daniel Prestwood, who is self-employed and cleans fish tanks around Nashville, says he found a better plan for 2018, with monthly premiums that dropped from $300 to $200. He says he tries not to get too frustrated by the political wrangling over health care.\n\n\"All I know is that for 2018 I'll have a good health care plan in place,\" he says, \"and that's the best I can hope for at this point.\"\n\nAnd even with the Trump administration's efforts to hobble the ACA, in Tennessee, the number of applications processed by federally funded insurance guides \u2014 known as navigators and certified application counselors \u2014 has already surpassed last year's. As of early last week, with 10 days left in open enrollment, more than 1,200 individuals had applied with official help, eclipsing the total from all of 2016, when the enrollment period was several weeks longer.\n\nWhile application assistants only work with a tiny fraction of the 235,000 Tennesseans who have marketplace plans, Sandy Dimick of Family and Children's Services Nashville, says she expects total enrollment will exceed last year's total, as well. Navigators around the U.S. have worried that cuts to the federal advertising budget in 2017, and a lack of cheerleading from the White House, could drive down enrollment.\n\nTake note: Though enrollment for most states ends Friday night, residents of nine states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Washington) and the District of Columbia have slightly more time to sign up.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with local member stations and Kaiser Health News.

You can bet I'll be marching right alongside them, continuing to travel around the country advocating for the basic rights and health care that all people deserve.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood will announce its future plans after the board of directors meets next week, the organization says.\n\nFor more than a decade, Richards has held down a tough job as the group's most high-profile spokeswoman.\n\nShe's been called upon repeatedly to defend the reproductive rights organization's work, which includes providing contraception and health screenings to women around the country, as well as about a third of the nation's abortions.\n\n\"It's a shame to think that there are people in this country who are so committed to ending women's access to both birth control, and safe and legal abortion, that they'll really resort to any means to try to entrap people, twist the truth, in order to reach their ends,\" Richards told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2015.\n\nHer testimony followed the release of secretly recorded sting videos by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress. The organization accused Planned Parenthood of selling fetal body parts. Richards said the videos were deliberately misleading.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has long been a lightning rod for criticism from abortion-rights opponents, who've made cutting public funding for the group a major priority. Under current law, it's illegal for federal funds to pay for abortions in most cases. But Planned Parenthood does receive about half a billion dollars per year in public money, largely to provide services such as contraception and cancer screenings for low-income women, who make up a majority of patients served by the organization's health centers.\n\nRichards' departure from Planned Parenthood comes at a time when many abortion-rights opponents are feeling optimistic about advancing their goals: President Donald Trump's first year in office has given abortion opponents several victories and put Planned Parenthood on the defensive.\n\nThe news of a leadership transition was greeted with celebration and calls for change at Planned Parenthood by abortion rights opponents.\n\nPenny Nance, CEO of the conservative group Concerned Women for America, which opposes abortion rights, says whoever takes over for Richards is likely to face more battles with activists who want to see more legal restrictions on abortion.\n\n\"This is a very sad legacy, and I hope that whoever comes after her will reconsider the direction and mission of Planned Parenthood,\" Nance told NPR.\n\nMeanwhile, abortion rights advocates are praising her leadership. In a statement to NPR, Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Richards \"a force\" who \"fights to make this country a better place for women and families.\"\n\nEven before coming to Planned Parenthood, Richards was no stranger to Capitol Hill or political action. She was a top staffer to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and before that, a grassroots organizer for progressive causes.\n\nRichards, who's 60 and married with three children, got the taste for politics from her mother, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, famous for her wit and sharp-tongued criticism of George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Michel Martin in 2014, Cecile Richards talked about growing up with parents for whom political activism was in the water.\n\n\"They were into politics like other couples were into bowling,\" Richards said, \"Every movement that came through town \u2013 whether it was the farmworkers movement, the labor movement, the women's movement \u2013 they were into, and so were all their friends.\"\n\nIn 2016, a year where gender issues were often at the center of the political debate, Richards spoke out in support of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at the party's national convention in Philadelphia, heralding the \"glass ceiling\" she believed Clinton was about to break by becoming the first female President of the United States.\n\nThat ceiling, of course, did not fall, but Richards has remained an active voice for reproductive rights and against President Trump. In the days after Trump's inauguration, she addressed the 2017 Women's March in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt this year's march in Las Vegas, Richards admonished white women to \"listen up,\" alluding to recent electoral victories for Democrats in states including Alabama, where black women and other voters of color turned out in large numbers to support Democratic candidates like Sen. Doug Jones.\n\n\"We've got to do better,\" Richards told the crowd. \"It is not up to women of color to save this country from itself.

But the state's political history is littered with episodes mixing sex and power in unseemly ways.\n\nOne of the first notable cases is John Winston. The former state senator was elected governor in 1853, six years after killing a doctor who was his wife's lover, in a duel. More recently, Gov. Robert Bentley resigned in April 2017 after a sex scandal and cover-up attempt involving one of his aides.\n\nBut one of the most notable politicians to face a scandal that rivals Moore's is \"Big Jim\" Folsom, a former Democratic governor who served two non-consecutive terms in the 1940s and 50s.\n\nRetail politics played a major role in Folsom's career, as it does in Moore's. Folsom toured the state with a hillbilly band called the \"Strawberry Pickers\" and brought a mop and bucket on stage to let voters know that if elected, he would \"clean out the capitol.\" He later collected donations in the bucket.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of Moore's appeal to evangelical voters, Folsom commissioned a campaign ballad with the lyrics: \"What do you, pray? Big Jim Folsom's gonna be governor again!\"\n\nWhile Moore has strenuously denied the charges against him, Folsom completely embraced being called a womanizer.\n\nIn the press, Folsom became known as \"Kissing Jim\" in part because of a publicity stunt in 1948 when he kissed 100 models in New York City who had voted him \"The Nation's Number One Leap Year Bachelor.\" The event attracted 2,500 onlookers and caused a traffic jam.\n\nAmong Folsom's other claims was that he had kissed \"50,000 of the sweetest mouths in Dixie\" and that he had \"started with the 16-year-old ones and worked up from there.\"\n\nIn yet another memorable instance, Folsom is said to have complained that his opponents were setting political traps for him. \"If they bait a hook with whiskey and women, they'll catch Big Jim every time.\"\n\nThe scandal that threatened to derail his political career came in the second year of his first term. A former hotel cashier from Birmingham filed a paternity suit claiming that Folsom was the father of her son. Nine days later, Folsom staged the kissing event in New York City and then he got married, which helped to silence his critics and settled the lawsuit.\n\nThen Folsom did something that would seemingly kill any political career and admitted he was the father of the cashier's son. Pundits wondered if Folsom would win re-election the next time he was eligible (consecutive terms in Alabama weren't allowed at the time).\n\nBut to everyone's surprise, at least to everyone who didn't live in Alabama, Folsom was easily elected to a second term in 1954. Why? Political commentator Steve Flowers points to the same reason that Roy Moore may win: Alabamians hate being told how they should vote by anyone who doesn't live in the state.\n\nHistorian Wayne Flynt points to the state motto, \"We Dare Defend Our Rights\" and argues it's baked into the consciousness of the state's citizens, especially when Alabamians are mocked for being \"backwards.\"\n\ntoggle caption Alabama Department of Archives and History\n\n\"If sophisticated, better educated cultures that are less evangelical make fun of you and your people you react with a 'bunker mentality,\" says Flynt.\n\nWhen it comes to issues of sexual morality, Flynt argues Alabamians are actually of two minds.\n\n\"On one hand we celebrate the virgin and on the other we celebrate the floozy. We celebrate the saint and we celebrate the 'hell of a good fella,'\" which includes people like Folsom.\n\nFolsom's third bid for governor in 1962 ended with a loss to yet-another populist politician, George Wallace. Folsom's defeat was said to be due to a disastrous appearance on television in which he appeared to be drunk. Folsom later claimed that he had been drugged.\n\nAlthough Big Jim's career faded after that election, his son, Jim Folsom, Jr., went on to become a force in state politics and was elected twice as lieutenant governor. \"Little Jim,\" as he is known, became governor in 1993 after the incumbent resigned due to a corruption scandal and served in that post for nearly two years.", "keywords": ["governor", "folsoms", "kissing", "folsom", "state", "elected", "political", "jim", "scandal", "alabama", "moore", "roy", "grappled"], "polarity": 0.0964886964886965, "subjectivity": 0.3756734006734007},

The anthropologist, who has spent four decades teaching at Princeton University, was introducing a class called Cultural Freedoms: Hate Speech, Blasphemy, and Pornography \u2014 and his question was meant to shock.\n\n\"What is worse,\" he asked students last Tuesday, according to The Daily Princetonian, \"a white man punching a black man, or a white man calling a black man a n*****?\"\n\nThe student newspaper reports that Rosen, a white man, went on to use the racial slur multiple times in the ensuing discussion, despite increasingly strong objections from some students. Citing student accounts, the Princetonian notes Rosen defended his use of the word as \"necessary\" and intended to \"deliver a gut punch\" \u2014 but by lecture's end, several students had walked out in protest.\n\nNow, just one week later, the course is no more. It was canceled by Rosen after a weeklong storm of debate over the incident, including one criticism that the effect of his words \u2014 no matter the intent behind them \u2014 \"can only be described as personal assault, even though the injuries are not visible on the surface of the skin.\" A handful of national media outlets caught wind of the simmering controversy, as well.\n\nUniversity spokesman Michael Hotchkiss tells NPR the decision to cancel the course after just one week was Rosen's, and that the school exerted no pressure on him to do so. Rosen himself did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I respect professor Rosen's decision about how to teach the subject in the way that he did, by being explicit in using very difficult words \u2014 and they are very difficult words,\" Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber said at a previously scheduled town hall meeting Monday.\n\n\"It's a tough kind of conversation to have,\" he added, \"and I think professor Rosen himself has expressed his view \u2014 and certainly it is my view \u2014 that it is important to have the kind of conversation when people feel uncomfortable about the language and why they might or might not feel that it's appropriate to use the language.\"\n\nCarolyn Rouse, chairwoman of the university's anthropology department, also defended her colleague in a letter to the Daily Princetonian shortly after news of the incident surfaced. She wrote that this is far from the first time Rosen has begun a course in this way, \"breaking a number of taboos\" \u2014 such as saying a racial slur or having a student wipe her feet on the American flag \u2014 in order to elicit a visceral response in students and explore why.\n\nAccording to its description, the course had planned to explore the power of oppressive symbols and how \"freedom of expression is always limited, both by the harm that may be said to occur if unbridled and by the constraints of the dominant culture.\"\n\n\"This is the first year he got the response he did from the students. This is diagnostic of the level of overt anti-black racism in the country today. Anti-American and anti-Semitic examples did not upset the students, but an example of racism did,\" Rouse wrote. \"This did not happen when Obama was president, when the example seemed less real and seemed to have less power.\"\n\nYet others, including parent De'Andre Salter, see the matter in starkly different terms. Salter took to the pages of the same student paper to rebut the points of Rouse's argument the day after it was published.\n\n\"Has anyone offended by flag desecration been oppressed, discriminated against, or systemically denied civil rights? In fact, both flag desecrators and those offended by them have been offered more protections than those called 'n*****' by their oppressors,\" Salter wrote in part.\n\nTimothy Haupt, a lecturer in the writing program at Princeton, argued that though there may be teaching value in drawing out an emotional reaction, the issue rests in how Rosen handled that reaction.\n\n\"My main concern here is with Rosen's response to student discomfort and confusion, which strikes me as profoundly unproductive, because he appears to have avoided (and perhaps indefinitely postponed) an important teaching moment,\" Haupt said.\n\nHaupt noted Rouse's point about students' heightened sensitivity to examples of racism \u2014 but, he countered, \"if a shifting context has influenced how students respond to certain course material, doesn't that suggest that we as educators have the responsibility to adapt our teaching to guarantee a favorable outcome?\"\n\n\"Rosen could have stepped back, clarified the difference between using hate speech and talking about it, and then asked his class how they felt comfortable representing the term going forward \u2014 so that the conversation could continue,\" Haupt added. \"But that isn't what happened.\"\n\nStill, the university is standing by its longtime professor.\n\n\"I both believe the academic freedom is important to make the pedagogical decision and I respect the pedagogical decision that he made,\" Eisgruber said Monday, \"although I also appreciate it's a controversial one and I understand why it's controversial.\"", "keywords": ["students", "slur", "teaching", "white", "contention", "amid", "rosen", "student", "course", "words", "wrote", "cancels", "decision", "speech", "man", "hate", "professor"], "polarity": 0.0033597883597883643, "subjectivity": 0.4793452380952381},

That certainly hasn't helped there.\"\n\nPointing to Chicago to suggest that gun laws don't work is not a new talking point \u2014 Trump claimed Chicago had \"the toughest gun laws in the United States\" in a 2016 presidential debate; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise pointed to Chicago as a place with high crime despite tight gun laws.\n\nAnd the rhetoric goes beyond politicians. The right-wing site Breitbart has on many occasions posted articles with headlines containing the phrase \"gun-controlled Chicago.\"\n\nThis can sound like a potent talking point \u2014 it is a huge city with a notorious crime problem, which Trump already used regularly to talk about creating law and order. It also packs the added rhetorical punch of being closely linked to President Obama, whose actions Trump has worked hard to undo.\n\nBut while gun violence in Chicago is high, the rest of this common talking point doesn't really hold water.\n\nHigh crime and tough gun laws\n\nIt's also true that there were more than 4,000 shooting victims in Chicago in 2016. It's also true that Chicago has suffered a massive amount of gun crime recently. In 2016, homicides in Chicago sharply rose, mostly as a result of gun homicides, as the University of Chicago crime lab found in a January report.\n\nGun homicides in the city rose by 61 percent between 2015 and 2016. That helped make the gun homicide rate in Chicago particularly huge compared to other similar cities. The rate was 25.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016, compared to 14.7 in Philadelphia and just 2.3 in New York.\n\nIt also had a relatively high number of guns recovered \u2014 243 per 100,000 residents. That's roughly on par with Philadelphia and much higher than Los Angeles or New York.\n\nBut it's not true that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country, as other fact checkers have also repeatedly found.\n\nIt is true that Illinois has tougher gun laws than many other states. The state is one of seven that requires licenses or permits to buy any firearm, and it's one of five that requires waiting periods for buying any firearm. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun laws nationwide, has given the state a B+ for its gun laws.\n\nChicago itself has some tough laws \u2014 there is an assault-weapons ban in Cook County, for example. But it's not true that Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. At one point, it did have much tougher laws \u2014 it had banned handguns in the city limits, but a 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared that ban unconstitutional, and a 2010 ruling reaffirmed that. The city also had had a gun registry program since 1968, but ended it in 2013 when the state passed a law allowing the concealed carry of weapons.\n\n\"We generally think of California as having the strongest gun laws in the country,\" said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"The whole state's laws are pretty strong.\"\n\nThe center has given California an A rating and ranks it No. 1 in terms of the tightness of its gun laws. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales, among other things.\n\n\"Some cities go even beyond that,\" Shearer added. \"San Francisco has a safe storage law, requiring that guns kept in the home are kept locked.\"\n\nThat's a regulation that Chicago, for example, does not have.\n\nQuibbling over exactly what part of the U.S. is No. 1 in terms of gun-law strictness, however, isn't the most compelling part of Sanders' statement. She also said that having gun regulations \"certainly hasn't helped\" in Chicago.\n\nThat's a much more controversial claim \u2014 and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n\nState lines don't stop guns\n\nIt's important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana. So while it's easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.\n\n\"It's not a scientific study. It's an anecdote,\" said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University. \"They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates. Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.\"\n\nD.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws. (It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.)\n\nNeither Wisconsin nor Indiana requires licenses or permits to purchase a gun, for example, nor do they require waiting periods. While Illinois has that B+ rating from the law center, Wisconsin has a C- and Indiana a D-.\n\nAnd there's good evidence that being next-door to those states keeps Chicago criminals well-supplied with guns. A 2015 study of guns in Chicago, co-authored by Cook, found that more than 60 percent of new guns used in Chicago gang-related crimes and 31.6 percent used in non-gang-related crimes between 2009 and 2013 were bought in other states. Indiana was a particularly heavy supplier, providing nearly one-third of the gang guns and nearly one-fifth of the non-gang guns.\n\nOther evidence corroborates this \u2014 a 2014 Chicago Police Department report found that Indiana accounted for 19 percent of all guns recovered by the department between 2009 and 2013.\n\nNew firearms trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released last week likewise shows that Illinois as a whole faces a massive influx of guns. Of around 8,700 firearms recovered in Illinois and for which the bureau found a source state, more than half came from out of state \u2014 1,366, nearly 16 percent, came from Indiana alone.\n\nBy comparison, 82 percent of guns recovered in Indiana and traced were from within Indiana, suggesting that criminals in that state don't have to cross state lines, like those in Illinois, to get their weapons.\n\nAll of this might suggest that criminals will just go to whatever lengths necessary get their hands on guns, regardless of whatever laws are in place.\n\nBut that's the wrong way to think about it, Cook said.\n\n\"No one's in a position to say that Chicago's various special regulations and Illinois's regulations are doing no good,\" he said, \"because we don't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those.\n\nSources:\n\n2016 Gun Law State Scorecard.

We'll just talk among ourselves,\" commands Bill Doherty, a family therapist who teaches at the University of Minnesota. \"Those of you who are in the blue group, your job is to listen and learn something here.\"\n\nDoherty challenges the red group to name some of the things about their fellow conservatives that bother them.\n\n\"Uh, OK then, I'll throw out a name,\" says one man. \"Trump.

Increasingly, Americans socialize with, worship alongside and even date only people who share their ideology.\n\nFiguring out how to talk across this divide is hard. But there's one group of professionals that has a long history helping people find common ground \u2014 marriage and family therapists.\n\nHealing divisions\n\nThis exercise is called a fishbowl. It's been used in group therapy sessions for decades.\n\n\"What happens is, people in the middle forget about the other group,\" Doherty explains. \"They're just talking to each other. And so it's a chance to kind of eavesdrop on a group that you'd never have a chance to do before, and then you get some things from that that you can't get any other way.\"\n\nThe fishbowl is one part of a day-long workshop. Participants also discuss stereotypes \u2014 both of themselves and of the other side \u2014 and they engage in question-and-answer sessions.\n\nAll of these exercises are drawn from Doherty's experience as a counselor. They're meant to heal divisions within a family or other social group.\n\nThis workshop applies them to the political divide.\n\n\"These are not mostly purples,\" says Doherty. \"These are reds and blues. But they are willing to listen, and what I believe is that a lot of Americans are willing to listen.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chas Sisk/Nashville Public Radio Chas Sisk/Nashville Public Radio\n\nDoherty has been running these workshops since late last year \u2014 just a few weeks after the election \u2014 on behalf of a program called Better Angels.\n\nThe organization's name refers to a line in President Abraham Lincoln's First Inaugural Address \u2014 the voice of conscience that prizes unity over division. It was delivered less than six weeks before the outbreak of the Civil War, another time when Americans were deeply divided.\n\nBetter Angels hopes to bridge this era's political chasm.\n\n\"Just about every issue you can think of \u2014 not just a few, but every issue \u2014 is just gridlocked,\" says David Blankenhorn, the organization's president and founder. \"We don't even agree on our ability to talk to each other any more.\"\n\n19th-century approach\n\nBetter Angels holds itself out as a political movement in the making. It's held 40 workshops so far across the Midwest, the Northeast and the South, and it draws inspiration from the Farmer's Alliance, which began at the grassroots in the 1800s and eventually became a third party, the Populists. The Alliance faded away shortly after the turn of the 20th century, but only after shaking up the political landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Better Angels wants to change the way politics is conducted today.\n\n\"We'd ultimately like to bring together political leaders and everybody else,\" says Blankenhorn. \"But beginning at the level of just citizen-to-citizen, can we talk to one another? ... Can we at least recognize the goodwill of the other side?\"\n\nBut organizers admit, one of the biggest challenges they face is selection bias. Participants have to want to hear the other side, and although the workshops are free of charge, they have the means to spend a day getting it.\n\nThe group meeting that met in Brentwood on a recent Saturday was overwhelmingly white, Judeo-Christian and middle class. They're not tasked with finding issues they agree on, but through the discussions, it nonetheless emerges that many share some common views, on topics like opposing welfare fraud and supporting some level of immigration.\n\nEven one of the participants, Brentwood resident Beth Malow, wonders whether she's truly hearing the other side. She describes herself as a moderate, fiscally conservative Democrat.\n\n\"For me, that was really understanding somebody who, let's say, voted for Donald Trump, and what it was that motivated him. Was it wanting change?\"\n\nBut none of the conservatives who attended Malow's workshop were ardent Trump supporters. Several from the red group confess they didn't even vote for him; those that did, generally aren't happy with his performance.\n\nStill, Malow says the conversation has widened understanding of what people mean when they call themselves \"conservatives.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chas Sisk/Nashville Public Radio Chas Sisk/Nashville Public Radio\n\n\"One thing we don't want to do is consider ourselves to be uni-dimensional. People are multidimensional. People have many different sides.\"\n\nAnother person who's on hand is Greg Smith. Despite an ailing back, he's driven all the way from southwestern Ohio to sit in as an observer. In the spring, Smith took part in one of the first red/blue workshops.\n\n\"I was what one might consider a real hardcore conservative,\" he recalls. \"And just kind of immovable.\"\n\nBut through Better Angels, Smith met a Muslim man who also lives in southwestern Ohio. Smith says they've become friends, meeting for lunch and even going to a service at his Pentecostal church. Soon they plan to visit a mosque.\n\n\"It's been an eye-opener. I've actually changed my viewpoint of some people, even President Obama,\" he says. \"I've changed the way I've looked at some things.\"\n\nSmith is now training to becoming a Better Angels moderator.\n\nHe wants to learn how to lead these conversations in his community.", "keywords": ["talk", "group", "smith", "bridge", "marriage", "sisknashville", "chas", "counseling", "political", "uses", "workshops", "divide", "methods", "better", "angels", "public", "help"], "polarity": 0.07227011494252875, "subjectivity": 0.34966475095785443},

America was built on her citizens. ... Look at the 19th century. What built America's called the American system, from Hamilton to Polk to Henry Clay to Lincoln to the Roosevelts. [It was] a system of protection of our manufacturing, financial system that lends to manufacturers, OK, and the control of our borders. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on. The American system.\" \u2013 Steve Bannon\n\nPresident Trump's former strategic adviser offered this riff about American history on CBS's 60 Minutes. He was responding to interviewer Charlie Rose, who said that \"people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy. That's what immigration has been in America.\" Bannon said he was \"dead wrong.\"\n\nSo let's explore: Does the history Bannon cited support his case?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nFirst: Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. He was born in the West Indies. In the 18th century he fought for his adopted country in war (as immigrants often have) and then, as treasury secretary, he contributed immensely to his adopted country's economy (as immigrants often have). He argued for the government to pay Revolutionary War debts, dreamed up a sophisticated financial system, and ended up on the $10 bill. Even in the 21st century, he continues to generate economic activity as the subject of a Broadway musical.\n\nBannon is close enough in calling Hamilton a citizen, since he was present at the founding of the country \u2014 although all Founding Fathers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, who arrived in the territory of native nations. This illustrates the essential problem in claiming the country was built by citizens and not immigrants: Immigrants often contributed and also became citizens.\n\nIt's meaningful that Bannon cites Abraham Lincoln, too, in his argument about immigrants. In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation supporting construction of a transcontinental railroad, which began a few years later. It was difficult to find laborers willing to work in harsh conditions, so railroad executives hired immigrants. Chinese workers were among those who laid tracks over the mountains from the west, until they met crews of Irish laborers coming from the east. Their meeting in Utah was an iconic American moment.\n\nImmigrants contributed more than brawn. During the Civil War, Confederate rebels launched the Virginia, a seemingly invulnerable ironclad warship. President Lincoln's government responded with its own ironclad, called the Monitor, so innovative that it became the ancestor of all modern warships. It was designed by a brilliant engineer named John Ericsson, a Swedish immigrant.\n\nAs a politician, Lincoln was forced to address resistance to immigration. A powerful anti-immigrant movement rose up in the 1840s and '50s against Irish Catholics. The Know-Nothings, as they were called, won many elections, but Lincoln declined to join them. \"I am not a Know-Nothing,\" Lincoln wrote. \"That is certain. How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.\"\n\nBannon also asserts that 19th century Americans focused on \"the control of our borders.\" That is the opposite of the case. Americans were repeatedly moving beyond their borders. American settlers captured much of Tennessee from American Indians; they took parts of Florida from Spain; and in the most audacious move of all, sheared off Texas from Mexico. In each case some of the Americans involved could have been labeled \"illegal immigrants.\" One of the presidents Bannon referenced, James K. Polk, confirmed the annexation of Texas by going to war against Mexico. Some Mexicans perforce became Americans, because the borders had moved past them.\n\nBannon also cites specific 19th century economic policies. He is correct that there really was an \"American System.\" Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky made that his brand name for a basket of programs. Clay supported tariffs on imports to protect American industry. He supported internal improvements, such as roads and canals. And he supported the creation of a national bank (an idea borrowed from the immigrant Hamilton).\n\nClay's system was immensely appealing to many Americans \u2014 Lincoln among them. It set the terms of national debate for decades. But tariffs that Clay supported also caused intense political conflict, and were denounced as special interest deals for manufacturers. When South Carolina first defied federal authority around 1830, decades before the Civil War, the dispute was not over slavery but a tariff. Then as now, there were arguments for and against any given tariff. The arguments against them are ones Bannon has employed in other contexts. A protective tariff empowers the government to interfere in the economy, and demands supreme wisdom by government officials to avoid unforeseen consequences. Tariffs may become tools of what Bannon has described as \"the administrative state,\" which he proposed to \"deconstruct\" when in the White House.\n\nThe \"administrative state\" argument was also used against Clay's Bank of the United States \u2014 it was described as a corrupt and unconstitutional exercise of government power. Who made this case? Andrew Jackson, a president Bannon reveres and compares to Donald Trump. Jackson also famously vetoed Clay-supported road building. The fight between Jackson and Clay was part of an eternal American debate over the scope of government. In his use of history, Bannon has favored both sides of this argument.\n\nThe 19th century was a time of tremendous growth and ferment in the United States, when Americans were wrestling with some of the same questions we face now: Who are we? What does our country stand for? And who counts as an American?\n\nBannon is correct to find this history relevant, though perhaps not the way he intends. He's right that Americans built a powerful country in the 19th century. But that country was diverse, fed off immigration, was constantly changing, and was not really walled off from the world. Any suggestion otherwise is factually wrong.\n\nSteve Inskeep is co-host of NPR's Morning Edition and is writing a book on America's 19th century westward expansion.", "keywords": ["century", "system", "lincoln", "americans", "war", "steve", "fact", "bannon", "kind", "check", "american", "america", "19th", "country", "1800s", "immigrants", "bannons"], "polarity": 0.14430465367965367, "subjectivity": 0.4239989177489178},

The White House estimates that could cover up to 1.8 million people.\n\nIn exchange, the White House wants an immigration measure to include $25 billion for a border wall, though the memo concedes that border security \"takes a combination of physical infrastructure, technology, personnel, [and] resources.\" In other words, not necessarily the coast-to-coast physical structure on the Southern border that Trump promised at campaign rallies.\n\nThe White House also wants changes to the legal immigration system, including policies that prioritize family members \"to spouses and minor children only.\" And the administration wants to completely eliminate the visa lottery system, which the memo says \"is riddled with fraud and abuse and does not serve the national interest.\"\n\nA senior White House official frames the outline as a \"bipartisan compromise position,\" but Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly rejected including changes to the legal immigration system as part of any DACA fix, even as they've offered to increase funding for border security. And for some Democrats the window of bipartisan outreach seems to have closed.\n\n\"The White House is using Dreamers to mask their underlying xenophobic, isolationist, and un-American policies, which will harm millions of immigrants living in the United States and millions of others who want to legally immigrate and contribute to our country,\" Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement in reaction to the White House framework.\n\nAnd a Democratic lawmaker who has been a forceful advocate for the cause of those enrolled in DACA suggested that meeting the White House's demands would come at too high a price. \"$25 billion as ransom for Dreamers with cuts to legal immigration and increases to deportations doesn't pass the laugh test,\" tweeted Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted that the proposals are part of \"an unmistakeable campaign to make America white again.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has promised to hold Senate floor debate on an immigration measure in the coming weeks, offered praise for the outline but made it clear Congress will still craft the actual language of a bill. \"I am hopeful that as discussions continue in the Senate on the subject of immigration, members on both sides of the aisle will look to this framework for guidance as they work towards an agreement,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\nThe memo mirrors the broad priorities that White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other Trump administration officials have been outlining for weeks. But as President Trump has repeatedly shifted his public statements on any immigration measure, congressional leaders have been increasingly anxious for more clarification on what the White House wants from an eventual bill.", "keywords": ["weeks", "system", "outlines", "white", "wants", "trump", "memo", "border", "proposal", "house", "immigration", "trumps", "measure"], "polarity": 0.021547619047619048, "subjectivity": 0.22543974732750247},

He even played high school basketball against the Blackfeet Nation.\n\nBarnes points to Kennerly.\n\n\"This guy played basketball against him, although now he has to change his story,\" he says. \"He was telling me before, 'Oh yeah, we used to whip Whitefish's ass all the time.' \"\n\nNowadays, Kennerly puts it more diplomatically and says he simply used to play against Zinke.\n\n\"We've had a connection for a long time,\" Barnes says. \"We've lobbied him in the state legislature, we've lobbied him in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nWhen the congressman became interior secretary, the first place he visited was Glacier National Park, inviting the Blackfeet to join him for a prayer.\n\nBut Land Tawney, president of the Montana-based sportsmen's group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, says it felt like Zinke was proposing a new national monument for more politically ambitious reasons.\n\n\"I think the secretary has talked about wanting to come back to Montana after he's done being secretary and potentially run for governor,\" Tawney says.\n\nProtecting public lands is a big issue in Montana. While Zinke has encouraged mining, drilling and reducing the size of national monuments elsewhere in the country, he's left existing national monuments in Montana alone and he's urged mining bans near Yellowstone National Park.\n\nThose proposals imply Zinke has protected public lands in his home state, according to Tawney.\n\n\"I think the people of Montana hold our special places very near and dear,\" he says. \"If you do not protect those places I think it's a political nightmare for you in this state.\"\n\nDavid Parker, a political scientist at Montana State University, says Zinke may even want to run for president some day.\n\n\"Whatever his ambitions are, Montana is important to that moving forward,\" Parker says. \"You can't say you're going to be on a national stage and be a serious candidate if you don't have strong support in your home state.\"\n\nZinke's political ambitions didn't really matter to Barnes.

McNear remained in California.\n\nThe first letter in the collection, which the university says Obama wrote at a campus cafe, \"drinking V8 juice and listening to a badly scratched opera being broadcast,\" as he put it, finds Obama articulating what would become familiar themes in his later writing, feelings of not belonging and alienation (themes that many 21-year-olds might find familiar).\n\nIn September 1982, he writes of a college friend who will soon marry and a high school friend who manages a supermarket.\n\n\"I must admit large dollops of envy for both groups, my American friends consuming their life in the comfortable mainstream, the foreign friends in the international business world,\" Obama wrote McNear. \"Caught without a class, a structure, or a tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me.\n\n\"The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions, classes, make them mine, me theirs. Taken separately, they're unacceptable and untenable.\"\n\nHe ends the letter, which was written on yellow-lined note paper, \"I trust you know that I miss you, that my concern for you is as wide as the air, my confidence in you as deep as the sea, my love rich and plentiful, Love, Barack.\"\n\nIn a November 1982 letter, Obama writes of the enjoyment he takes in his relationship with McNear, and the challenge of \"forging a unity, mixing it up, constructing the truth to be found between the seams of individual lives. All of which requires breaking some sweat. Like a good basketball game. Or a fine dance. Or making love.\n\n\"We will talk long and deep, Alex, and see what we can make of this.\"\n\nIn June 1983, Obama writes McNear during a trip he took back to Indonesia, where he lived as a child and where his mother and sister remain.\n\n\"I can't speak the language well anymore. I'm treated with a mixture of puzzlement, deference and scorn because I'm American, my money and my plane ticket back to the U.S. overriding my blackness. I see old dim roads, rickety homes winding back towards the fields, old routes of mine, routes I no longer have access to.\"\n\nHe also expresses to McNear some uncertainty about the future of their relationship. \"I think of you often, though I stay confused about my feelings,\" Obama writes. \"It seems we will ever want what we cannot have; that's what binds us; that's what keeps us apart.\"\n\nLater that year, Obama and McNear are no longer lovers, but remain friends. He writes her of his struggles finding a job in New York, and of his tight finances. \"Salaries in the community organizations are too low to survive on right now, so I hope to work in some more conventional capacity for a year, allowing me to store up enough nuts to pursue those interests next,\" he says.\n\n\"One week I can't pay postage to mail a resume and writing sample,\" he writes, \"the next I have to bounce a check to rent a typewriter.\"\n\nBy 1984, Obama has found a job at Business International where he says, \"[c]uriously enough, I've emerged as one of the 'promising young men' of Business International, with everyone slapping my back and praising my work.\"\n\nHe writes he has \"cultivated strong bonds with the black women and their children in the company, who work as librarians, receptionists, etc.,\" while \"the only black men are teen messengers.\"\n\nHe concludes:\n\n\"The resistance I wage does wear me down \u2014 because of the position, the best I can hope for is a draw, since I have no vehicle or forum to try to change things. For this reason, I can't stay very much longer than a year. Thankfully, I don't yet feel like the job has dulled my senses or done irreparable damage to my values, although it has stalled their growth.\"\n\nEmory says facsimiles of Obama's letters will be on view Friday.

{"title": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/08/30/547411439/fact-check-4-claims-from-trumps-tax-speech", "text": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump pitched a tax overhaul package on Wednesday in a speech that was heavy on politicking and light on the particulars.\n\nTrump's tax policy ideas are still sketchy \u2014 when pitched in April, they amounted to one page of bullet points. In his Wednesday remarks, he didn't add much more detail beyond the broad strokes, saying he wants lower rates for the middle class, a simpler tax code, lower corporate rates and for companies to \"bring back [their] money\" from overseas to the U.S.\n\nIn his speech in Springfield, Mo., though, he said a few things that were misleading or could use more context. Here are four fact checks:\n\n1. Economic growth rate\n\n\"We just announced that we hit 3 percent in GDP. Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration during an eight-year period never hit 3 percent. So we're really on our way.\"\n\nHe's right that on Wednesday, the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the second quarter. This was an upward revision from a previously announced 2.6 percent (and will still be revised again).\n\nBut he is making it sound as if growth during his administration is already appreciably faster than it was during the Obama administration. That's not true. Quarterly GDP growth during the Obama presidency did hit 3 percent several times.\n\nThere's a technicality here, though: Trump used the phrase \"on a yearly basis.\" If he's talking about calendar years, he's right, but barely. According to Commerce Department data, annual GDP growth during Obama's presidency hit a high of 2.9 percent in 2015 \u2014 so, just shy of 3 percent. But then, if he is measuring any given 12-month period, he's not right; year-over-year GDP growth was at times over 3 percent during the Obama presidency.\n\nEither way, that 3 percent rate he pulled out is how annual growth would look if growth from the second quarter were to hold for a full year. Reporting the GDP rate in this annual way makes it easier to show whether growth was faster in, say, this quarter than it was in prior years. But once again, it still has that hypothetical aspect to it.\n\nAnd that leads to a more important point here: Many economists believe that sustained 3 percent growth, like Trump says he can help create, is unlikely. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget earlier this year tried to game out how that kind of GDP growth could happen. Its outlook was not rosy.\n\n\"By our estimates, returning capital growth, productivity growth, and prime-age labor force participation to where they were in the 1990s would result in 2.9-percent growth,\" they wrote. And getting to those levels, they added, would be \"an unlikely scenario given recent trends.\"\n\nIn other words, while Trump is celebrating this one quarter of growth, seeing it quarter after quarter after quarter would be a surprise.\n\n2. Comparing U.S. growth with other countries'\n\n\"You look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's 7, 8, 9. And I speak to them, leaders of the countries \u2014 'How are you doing?' 'Not well. Not well.' 'Why?' 'GDP is down to 7 percent.' And I'm saying, 'We were hitting 1 percent just a number of months ago.' \"\n\nWe can't fact-check Trump here in the strictest sense (that is, we don't really know what these other leaders are telling him), but we can check the assumption that we can compare the U.S.'s growth rate with other countries'. The answer: It doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The countries that are growing at 7 percent are emerging market economies like China or India or other emerging market economies,\" said Nick Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nHe explained that these countries have what some economists call a \"latecomer advantage\" \u2014 an additional lift that comes from starting out behind other countries. For example, he pointed to China, which has grown quickly in part because of foreign firms coming in and setting up shop there. So when Volkswagen sets up a plant in China, it's bringing in processes and technologies from the outside.\n\n\"They can do joint ventures or have foreign firms come in, they can license technology, they can improve labor productivity,\" he explained.\n\nThis is what helps a country like China or India have an economic growth rate of around 7 percent.\n\n3. A \"simple\" tax code\n\n\"We need a tax code that is simple, fair and easy to understand. And that means getting rid of loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests. Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax rates, reduced the number of tax brackets from 15 to two, and lowered tax rates for individuals and businesses. Since then, tax laws have tripled in size.\"\n\nThe Reagan tax plan, approved by Congress in 1986, did cut back on loopholes, and it did cut the number of brackets down to two.\n\nBut there's one important point buried in here, and it's that bit about the number of tax brackets and setting rates. Trump said he wants to make the tax code \"simple, fair, and easy to understand.\" Brackets and rates are not what make the tax code byzantine (\"fair\" is subjective, and we're staying out of that here).\n\n\"It's a very mild form of simplification,\" said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank, in an interview with NPR in 2015. \"The real complication in the system is in the tax base, not in the rate structure. Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you're eligible for the [earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans], given the child rules \u2014 once you've got that, then you just plug in the rates.\"\n\nThe brackets-simplicity argument is one Americans are bound to hear more as Congress debates a tax code overhaul; politicians try to draw this connection often. But slicing down deductions \u2014 and potentially upsetting some groups of voters \u2014 could be a tougher sell.\n\n4. The corporate tax rate\n\n\"Today we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent. And it's way more than that. And think of it \u2014 in some cases way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and many other nations also.\"\n\nThe top federal corporate tax rate is indeed 35 percent, and in some states, corporate tax rates can push that rate higher. In Iowa, the top corporate rate is 12 percent, and in five other states plus the District of Columbia, the rate is 9 percent or higher, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. (One could quibble with \"way higher,\" then, but in general, Trump is right on this.)\n\nThat's what puts the U.S. \"behind\" other countries, in Trump's estimation. Except what matters is the effective tax rate. Deductions and credits help bring U.S. companies' tax rates below what they would otherwise pay. The effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is only around 18.6 percent, which is on the high end compared with other advanced economies but not unusually high \u2014 it's a few percentage points below Japan, a few above Germany, and right in line with the U.K.\n\nAnd those tax rates vary widely from firm to firm: A recent report found that out of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies, 39 percent paid zero corporate taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015.", "keywords": ["way", "trump", "fact", "rate", "growth", "rates", "corporate", "check", "quarter", "gdp", "countries", "speech", "claims", "tax", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.06621248499399764, "subjectivity": 0.40658563425370153},

They speak of the threats and dangers posed by those in the U.S. illegally. Their words largely echo those of President Trump in warning that immigrants steal jobs from Americans and drag down the standard of living.\n\nA blunt Trump campaign ad released during the recent government shutdown accused Democrats of being \"complicit in all murders by illegal immigrants.\"\n\nBut it wasn't always so. For decades, leading figures in the GOP went out of their way to sound a compassionate note when it came to immigration policy. In recent years that rhetoric fell out of line with where the Republican base was, giving Trump the opportunity of a lifetime in 2016.\n\nReagan opposed \"putting up a fence\"\n\nEven in the age of Trump, Ronald Reagan remains the iconic conservative standard bearer for many in the party.\n\nAt a 1980 GOP presidential debate in Houston, Texas, Reagan spoke of Mexico as \"our neighbor to the south.\" He added, \"We should have a better understanding and better relationship than we've ever had.\" And as he continued, Reagan sounded a lot like he was weighing in on today's immigration debate.\n\n\"Rather than talking about putting up a fence,\" the future president said. \"Why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems?\" It's the kind of line you might hear from just about any Democratic senator in 2018.\n\nOn the stage debating him that day was another 1980 GOP presidential hopeful and future president, George H.W. Bush. He was asked by an audience member if children in the country illegally should be allowed to attend U.S. public schools.\n\nBush didn't hesitate, saying he doesn't want to see 6- or 8-year-olds being uneducated or \"made to feel that they're living outside the law.\"\n\nTIME YouTube\n\nReagan eventually signed a major immigration law that toughened border security, but offered amnesty to immigrants in the country illegally who entered before 1982.\n\nThe \"compassionate conservative\"\n\nA couple of decades later, the presidency of George W. Bush brought another major push for immigration overhaul. Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer notes that the 43rd president's campaign slogan of \"compassionate conservatism\" applied to immigration.\n\nFleischer says that because Bush had been governor of Texas, he had a realistic view of who was coming across the border. \"As a border governor, he had a personal understanding and a personal relationship with many of the immigrants who crossed the Rio Grande and came to Texas for work and liberty and for America's opportunity,\" Fleischer said.\n\nBush proposed changes to U.S. immigration law at an event at the White House in January 2004 that would make it easier for people to cross back and forth over the border to work legally in the United States. Bush described the problems he saw brought about by existing law. \"Many undocumented workers walked mile after mile, through heat of day and cold of the night. Some have risked their lives in dangerous desert border crossings,\" Bush said. \"Workers who seek only to earn a living end up in the shadows of American life.\"\n\nTrump harnesses the GOP base\n\nOver the past decade, though, a very different discussion of immigration has taken hold within the GOP, eventually building to the launch of Trump's presidential campaign in June 2015.\n\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump said that day at Trump Tower. \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we're getting.\"\n\nPair that with the \"Build the Wall, Build the Wall\" chanting by the candidate and the crowds at Trump rallies both before and after his election, and you get a pretty good distillation of how Trump's immigration rhetoric has tracked with the GOP base.\n\n\"Donald Trump talks about immigration in a way that's very different from how George Bush talks about it, or Mitt Romney talks about it, or John McCain talked about it,\" Fleischer said. \"But it's also true that Donald Trump won the election.\"\n\nSo far, such talk has worked with Trump's hard core supporters. What it means in terms of getting what he wants from Congress, or down the road at the ballot box, remains to be seen.\n\nKey, according to Fleischer, is how working-class voters look at the issue.\n\n\"Frankly, I think the biggest change was the economy weakened,\" he said. \"People in America were worried about their jobs and their livelihood, and they did worry about a surge of people coming through illegally, a lower-priced labor force that would squeeze Americans.\"\n\nEconomists say what drives wages goes way beyond immigration, but such worries gave the topic more potency than it previously had within the GOP.\n\nBut Mark Krikorian, an advocate for less immigration at the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Immigration Studies, has a his own theory. He doesn't think attitudes toward immigration have changed much at all among Republican voters. He thinks it's a case of past leaders simply being out of touch with where the party rank and file were on the issue.\n\n\"Ordinary Republican voters were just much more hawkish on immigration than Republican politicians and advisers and fixers and donors and the whole political class,\" Krikorian said.\n\nConservative voters were strong enough to prevent passage of immigration legislation pushed by President George W. Bush, whose support among Hispanics reached 40 percent in the 2004 election, a high for the GOP.\n\nIn 2013, conservatives in the House blocked an immigration bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. It came as the Republican Party was looking for ways to appeal to Hispanic voters following Mitt Romney's loss as the GOP presidential nominee in 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Krikorian said Trump recognized an opening: \"He took advantage of that gap between what the actual voters wanted and what the political class was offering.\"\n\nThere were other early signs of how the issue would play within GOP politics. In 2010, Marco Rubio won a Senate seat from Florida after successfully wooing support from the rising Tea Party movement. Once elected, Rubio \u2014 the son of Cuban immigrants \u2014 began working on the 2013 immigration legislation with a bipartisan group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight.\"\n\nHe was immediately shunned \u2014 and jeered in some cases \u2014 by Tea Party conservatives who once saw him as the future. Rubio ran for president in 2016, but never seriously threatened Trump's chances, as the eventual nominee made the immigration issue his own.\n\nAll of this is taking place as the United States becomes a more diverse nation, with Hispanics the fastest growing minority population in the country. In fact, the U.S. is on track to be a majority-minority nation by the year 2044, according to the U.S Census Bureau.\n\nIt was former President Barack Obama's back-to-back election victories in 2008 and 2012 that prompted a great deal of soul-searching within the Republican Party about immigration and about appealing to minority voters more broadly.\n\nPart of the proposed solution was to speak compassionately about the issue of immigration. Here's how former George W. Bush adviser Karen Hughes put it in an opinion piece published by Politico:\n\n\"The immigration rhetoric that came out of the Republican primary seemed harsh, unwelcoming and offputting to many minority voters. Obama increased his share of the Hispanic vote and won it 69 percent to 29 percent (per The New York Times exit poll); likewise he built a huge margin among Asian voters, 74-25, almost doubling the margin of his support compared to 2008. Both of those constituencies are hardworking, upwardly mobile, family-oriented, and should be open to Republican appeals if we don't make them feel unwelcome.\"\n\nTrump's election in 2016 seems to have put such sentiment on hold indefinitely for the GOP.\n\nNow Congress is tackling immigration once again. This time it appears there will be some kind of legislation passed. It may include some resolution for many of the undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nWhat's different this time is that many Republicans lawmakers have closed that gap with the GOP base. Any immigration legislation that passes will likely not be in line with what Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush once supported, but by virtue of being something President Trump supports likely would have the approval of his base.", "keywords": ["voters", "evolution", "trump", "border", "theyre", "gop", "gops", "republican", "immigration", "president", "george", "bush"], "polarity": 0.0634386790579451, "subjectivity": 0.4711899466486623},

Following the 2017 off-year election, the state is performing a first-in-the-nation risk-limiting audit of the statewide results.\n\n\"We're here to celebrate the fact that we've finally reached this milestone in our nation,\" Secretary of State Wayne Williams said.\n\nThe idea is to find strong statistical evidence that the election outcome was the correct one. The effort comes during a year when new revelations became public about Russian-backed attempts to break into state election systems and President Trump claimed without evidence that millions of people illegally cast ballots in 2016.\n\nThe kickoff day for the audit last week started with Williams holding up a Colorado Rockies hat in one hand, and a Denver Broncos hat in the other. The Rockies hat was full of the names of people in the room, members of the public, elections officials from other states, and a few computer scientists. The Broncos hat was full of plastic ten-sided dice.\n\nNo, this was not a pre-audit game of parcheesi, or the early stages of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. It's the key to generating a 20-digit number, called a \"seed,\" that the risk-limiting audit software needs. When a name was drawn from the Rockies cap, applause and cheers erupted from the room. Then the lucky contestant chose a die from the Broncos hat and rolled a number. This happened 20 times, until the seed was complete.\n\nWhy? The elaborate dance was the only way to obtain a truly random number.\n\nOnce fed into the software, the seed is used to target specific boxes of ballots in each Colorado county at random. The closer the race, the more ballots need to be pulled. Actual human beings will then compare those ballots to the election night record of how the machine counted them. It's an audit of the election process, an attempt to make sure the machines are interpreting ballots correctly.\n\nWhen Philip Stark's name was pulled from the hat, a particularly loud round of cheers went up. That could have something to do with Stark's formula, the one that needs that 20-digit number. In essence, Stark was the reason everyone was there that day.\n\nThe method of auditing elections produced by the University of California, Berkeley professor is different from others used in the past. Conventionally, audits start with the premise that the results are correct. Not this one.\n\nWith this risk-limiting audit, \"you start by assuming that the answer is wrong, you start by assuming that the reported winner didn't really win,\" he explained. From there, local officials work backward. \"Then you start saying 'I'm going to collect evidence,' and if the evidence becomes convincing that the winner really did win, I get to stop auditing.\"\n\nUnelected until proven elected, so to speak. Stark said this method could cut down on the number of ballots that need to be audited to ensure that an election's result is sound.\n\nThe software company Free & Fair built on the idea, taking Stark's formula and scaling it up so that states like Colorado can use the method statewide. Previously, it's been used in other states at the local level.\n\nThe software is open source, so other states can take it and modify it for their own use. Officials from Rhode Island came to observe the process in Colorado, along with members of the federal Election Assistance Commission. This whole process has been almost ten years in the making for Colorado and Williams, the secretary of state whose office is responsible for voting and elections, was basking in the moment.\n\n\"This is in many ways a new day for ensuring the integrity of elections,\" he said.\n\nColorado's audit must be completed, and the election certified, the day after Thanksgiving.

She noted that many, while supportive, expressed concerns about retaliations by their bosses if they spoke out. She noted that of the women who originally signed the letter, only five are staffers at the state Capitol.\n\n\"It's a power dynamic that's difficult even for female lawmakers,\" Corbin said. \"Even for women in the Legislature, men often control fundraising, your ability to get bills passed \u2014 even women at the highest levels feel that they're not insulated\" from retaliation.\n\nShe stressed that many men at the state Capitol have reached out to ask what they can do to help. But Corbin noted, some men are oblivious to sexual harassment, even when it happens right in front of them.\n\n\"They don't know what it looks like or how to intervene,\" Corbin said. \"Some of them don't even see what's happening with their own colleagues.\"\n\nThe women leaders write that \"millions of Americans were shocked\" to learn of Weinstein's behavior.\n\n\"We were not. This same kind of inappropriate, sexually harassing behavior cuts across every industry and facet of our society. No matter a woman's age, weight, religion, sexual orientation, race, social status, or position of power, she is not insulated from this behavior. It is pervasive,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter goes on to detail the ways in which all of the letters' signatories have endured or witnessed \"some form of dehumanizing behavior by men with power in our workplaces.\"\n\nTheir list is long and explicit: Groping. Touching. Inappropriate comments about bodies and abilities. Insults and sexual innuendo, frequently disguised as jokes. Promises and threats.\n\n\"They have leveraged their power and positions to treat us however they would like,\" the group wrote, noting that they didn't speak up before out of fear, out of shame.\n\n\"Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands. They are bosses, gatekeepers, and contacts. Our relationships with them are crucial to our personal success,\" they wrote. \"We don't want to jeopardize our future, make waves, or be labeled 'crazy,' 'troublemaker,' or 'asking for it.' Worse, we're afraid when we speak up that no one will believe us, or we will be blacklisted.\"\n\nThe signatories include Democrats and Republicans; dozens of lawmakers and other elected officials; lobbyists, political consultants; party leaders. In short, pretty much every sector of California's political world.\n\nThey are asking other women to come forward, and have launched a website to collect stories and support one another. And they are demanding that men support them.\n\n\"We're done with this,\" the letter states. \"Each of us who signed this op-ed will no longer tolerate the perpetrators or enablers who do. What now? It's time for women to speak up and share their stories. We also need the good men, and there are many, to believe us, have our backs, and speak up. Until more women hold positions of power, our future is literally dependent on men.

But in doing so, he left out the parts of the remarks that inflamed people's tempers the most, like his comment that there was violence \"on many sides.\"\n\nThat's just one of the misleading or untruthful things Trump said. We fact-checked 10 of his statements.\n\n1. Anti-Trump protesters\n\n\"And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK? That I can tell you.\"\n\nIt's impossible to fact-check exactly what Trump knew about protesters \u2014 if Secret Service agents spoke to Trump about protesters or what agents told him, for example.\n\nBut we do have at least some context on this claim: Trump very likely did see some protesters on his way to the convention center where his rally was held. In a pool report, Washington Times reporter David Boyer wrote about the anti-Trump activists along the route as the presidential motorcade drove to the rally site:\n\n\"We saw a smattering of supporters holding Trump/Pence signs and waving in the neighborhood near the hotel. As we got closer to the convention center, we saw more and more protesters. Hard to judge how many, but there were several hundred that we passed. \"Several people made obscene gestures at the motorcade. Some signs included 'Fire Trump' and 'Sad!' Also, 'Love One Another.' \"\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Trump didn't get the full scope of how many protesters were there, according to NPR's Geoff Bennett, who was traveling with the president as well. The motorcade didn't drive by the area where the overwhelming majority of protesters were gathered, Bennett reports. Those protesters numbered in the \"thousands,\" as Fox News and the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n2. Charlottesville statement\n\n\"I am really doing this to show you how dishonest these people are. Here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville. ... Here is what I said on Saturday:\n\n\" 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Va.' This is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event.\"\n\nThe key part here is this sentence: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.\"\n\nTrump did say that, but he left out the second part of that sentence. The full sentence was: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides\" (per a transcript from Vox).\n\nIt was that \"many sides\" part that angered many people \u2014 it appeared to put the KKK, neo-Nazi and other white supremacist rallygoers on the same moral footing as the counterprotesters who opposed them.\n\nHe made the comparison more than once in his responses to the events in Charlottesville. The Tuesday after the protest, he said:\n\n\"OK, what about the alt-left that came charging \u2014 excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" he said in response to a reporter's question. He later added, \"You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\"\n\n3. CNN ratings\n\n\"CNN, which is so sad, so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.\"\n\nEarly in August, CNN released new data showing that its ratings are healthy. According to the report:\n\n\"Year to date, 2017 is pacing to be CNN's highest on record in Total Day among total viewers and highest among 25-54 since 2003. 2017 is also pacing to be CNN's second largest audience since 2008 in primetime among 25-54 and total viewers.\"\n\nIn addition, Variety reported in June that CNN had its \"most-watched first quarter in 14 years.\"\n\nOf course, CNN isn't alone in getting these ratings boosts; all three major cable news networks \"saw double-digit ratings growth across the board for the second quarter of 2017,\" Variety also reported.\n\nTrump has made the claim before as part of his ongoing attacks on the media. He said CNN's ratings were down in July, too; PolitiFact likewise at the time found this to be \"flat wrong.\"\n\n4. \"Racism was evil\"\n\n\"I said racism was evil. Did they report that I said racism was evil? No.\"\n\nMultiple headlines from an array of news outlets reported that Trump called racism \"evil\" in his Aug. 14 address \u2014 in which he also called out the KKK and neo-Nazis specifically after political pressure to do so.\n\n5. New York Times \"apology\"\n\n\"The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, 'Well it wasn't really that much of an apology because they were losing so many people because they were misled.' \"\n\nTrump has claimed multiple times that the Times \"apologized,\" though this time he seemed to back off slightly by saying it \"essentially\" apologized. Either way, the New York Times did not apologize, as NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote in a fact-check of a Jan. 29 Trump tweet.\n\n\"New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper's coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that 'after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?' And a column from the paper's public editor (or ombudsman), Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its data/forecasting vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper's reporters could have done a better job of tapping into 'the sentiments of Trump supporters.' \"However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology.\"\n\nThe Times itself in a March 29 tweet responded to Trump: \"False, we did not apologize. We stand by our coverage & thank our millions of subscribers for supporting our journalism.\"\n\n6. Health insurance premiums\n\n\"Arizona is a disaster in terms of your price increase ... 116 percent.\"\n\nThis figure is correct. It comes from an October 2016 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. It found that among all states, Arizona would have the largest average premium hike in 2017, as measured by silver plans offered to 27-year-olds.\n\nBut when talking about Affordable Care Act premium increases, it's misleading to not also mention tax credits.\n\n\"The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act,\" as Will Stone, from NPR station KJZZ in Tempe, told NPR in March.\n\nStone added that GOP efforts to overhaul health care would very likely have made the situation in Arizona worse.\n\n\"The Republican replacement ... would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona.\"\n\n7. Job numbers\n\n\"Since I took the oath of office, we have added far more than 1 million jobs in the private sector. Unemployment is right now at almost a 17-year low.\"\n\nFrom February through July, U.S. firms have added 1,074,000 jobs, according to numbers from the Labor Department (with the caveat that those numbers are still subject to revision). That's solid growth, but it's not out of the norm for the last few years.\n\nAnd unemployment is 4.3 percent. The last time it was that low was May 2001, and the last time it was lower than that was February 2001 \u2014 so it has been 16 1/2 years since unemployment was lower than it is now.\n\n8. Economic growth\n\n\"Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent. Remember, everybody said you will not bring it up to 1 percent.\"\n\nEconomic growth in the second quarter was indeed 2.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter. One can quibble with the word \"surged\" here, but 2.6 percent isn't at all an unusually high economic growth number. Economic growth is often around or above that level.\n\nBut as far as \"everybody\" saying that Trump wouldn't be able to boost economic growth above 1 percent, that's false. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee in its December meeting, for example, projected 2.1 percent economic growth for 2017. Economic advisory firm IHS likewise projected that in 2017, growth would be above 2 percent \u2014 2.3 percent, to be exact.\n\nTrump himself has said he's aiming for even higher growth: 3 percent, to be exact (and that's down from a 4 percent prediction he had made before). Even sustained 3 percent growth is unlikely to happen, according to many economists.\n\n9. Increasing wages\n\n\"Wages are rising.\"\n\nWages are indeed rising, but not very quickly \u2014 in fact, considering the low unemployment rate, economists continue to wonder why they aren't rising faster.\n\n\"The mystery continues to be with the labour market this tight, and the level of improvement we continue to see, that wages stubbornly stay at 2% year-over-year wage growth. To me that continues to be the mystery of the jobs report,\" as Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told the BBC after the July jobs report was released.\n\nIn the last jobs report, wage growth accelerated slightly, to 2.5 percent annually, as Bloomberg reported. That's a positive development, but wage growth can bounce around from month to month; if the upward movement becomes sustained, that will be a more promising sign. As CNN reported after the last jobs report, many economists would consider wage growth around 3 to 3.5 percent to be a better sign that the job market is healthy.\n\n10. Stock market highs\n\n\"The stock market is at its all-time high in history.\"\n\nTrump is right: The Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 one of the most closely watched stock indexes \u2014 has posted several record highs this year, passing the 22,000 mark in early August. The S&P 500, another popular index, has likewise hit multiple highs this year.\n\nAll stock index records come with the caveat that they are not adjusted for inflation. In addition, Trump can't really claim credit for that entire rally, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in July. While his policy agenda of deregulation and lower corporate taxes may have some in the business community feeling confident, low interest rates and faster global growth are also likely helping to push stocks higher.", "keywords": ["report", "protesters", "reported", "trump", "economic", "fact", "growth", "check", "thats", "speech", "phoenix", "trumps", "times", "2017", "statements", "jobs"], "polarity": 0.051950585844028466, "subjectivity": 0.4435372732913719},

But that outcome was still unsatisfactory for many immigrant advocates because they've heard this before. Some have been fighting for the DREAM Act since they were teenagers and are now nearing 40.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nAll right, as we just heard, a big sticking point in the congressional negotiations over immigration is the fate of the DREAMers, the millions of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, it's a fight that's been escalating for decades.\n\nJOEL ROSE, BYLINE: The DREAM Act started with one undocumented immigrant. She's sometimes called the first DREAMer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TEREZA LEE PERFORMANCE OF CHOPIN'S \"FANTASIE-IMPROMPTU NO. 4 IN C SHARP MINOR, OP. 66\")\n\nROSE: Tereza Lee is a pianist and music teacher. This is her performing last year at member station WNYC. Lee was born in Brazil to Korean parents. She moved to Chicago when she was 2 and became a teenage prodigy. Her mentor encouraged her to apply to the top conservatories in the country, but Lee refused. Eventually, she confessed what no one outside her immediate family knew - she was in the country illegally.\n\nTEREZA LEE: I was hysterical. And I was in tears. And I told her, please don't report me to the police.\n\nROSE: Instead, Lee's mentor went to Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. She inspired Durbin to introduce a bill in 2001 that would create a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. He called it the DREAM Act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDICK DURBIN: If you grew up in this country and graduated from high school, if you had no serious problems with any criminal activity or background, we would give you a chance - just a chance.\n\nROSE: The name stuck, and young undocumented immigrants started to identify as DREAMers.\n\nCRISTINA JIMENEZ: I have been organizing since I was 19 years old, and I'm 33 (laughter). So it's been quite a time.\n\nROSE: Cristina Jimenez came to the U.S. from Ecuador when she was 13. She's the co-founder of the activist group United We Dream.\n\nJIMENEZ: Every year that we fought for the DREAM Act I had hope that we could win. And every year, you know, I would be disappointed and sad.\n\nROSE: The DREAM Act finally passed the House in 2010, almost a decade after it was first introduced. But it stalled in the Senate. Here's Republican Jeff Sessions - then a senator, now the attorney general - explaining why he voted no.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEFF SESSIONS: This bill is a law that at its fundamental core is a reward for illegal activity.\n\nROSE: Hard-liners consider the DREAM Act an amnesty that would encourage more illegal immigration. But DREAMers and their allies kept up pressure on the White House, and in 2012 President Obama announced a new policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in the Rose Garden.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: Now, let's be clear. This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix.\n\nROSE: Indeed, the Trump administration is terminating DACA, leaving roughly 700,000 young immigrants without work permits or protection from deportation. Today, public opinion is largely behind letting the DREAMers stay. That idea has support from some Republicans as well as most Democrats. But the issue is caught up in the larger debate about immigration. The White House says any deal should include big changes to the legal immigration system and billions of dollars for a border wall. That's left the Democratic Party split with some willing to make concessions and others flatly refusing. Still, Cristina Jimenez says, this is progress.\n\nJIMENEZ: I never thought that it would take us this long, but I feel really proud of the fact that the entire country is now engaging in the conversation about our lives and our families and our right to be here.\n\nROSE: While that debate continues, roughly a hundred people are losing their DACA status every week and don't know if they'll ever get it back. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report we say that roughly 100 people are losing their DACA status per week.

{"title": "So What Exactly Is 'Blood Quantum'?", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/02/09/583987261/so-what-exactly-is-blood-quantum", "text": "So What Exactly Is 'Blood Quantum'?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leigh Wells/Getty Images/Ikon Images Leigh Wells/Getty Images/Ikon Images\n\nIf you're Native American, there's a good chance that you've thought a lot about blood quantum \u2014 a highly controversial measurement of the amount of \"Indian blood\" you have. It can affect your identity, your relationships and whether or not you \u2014 or your children \u2014 may become a citizen of your tribe.\n\nBlood quantum was initially a system that the federal government placed onto tribes in an effort to limit their citizenship. Many Native nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, still use it as part of their citizenship requirements.\n\nAnd how tribes use blood quantum varies from tribe to tribe. The Navajo Nation requires a minimum of 25 percent \"Navajo blood,\" and Turtle Mountain requires a minimum of 25 percent of any Indian blood, as long as its in combination with some Turtle Mountain.\n\nBlood quantum minimums really restrict who can be a citizen of a tribe. If you've got 25 percent of Navajo blood \u2014 according to that tribe's blood quantum standards \u2014 and you have children with someone who has a lower blood quantum, those kids won't be able to enroll.\n\nSo why keep a system that's decreasing your tribe's rolls and could lead to its demise?\n\n\"I use the term 'Colonial Catch 22' to say that there is no clear answer, and that one way or another, people are hurt,\" says Elizabeth Rule. She's a doctoral candidate at Brown University who specializes in Native American studies, and also a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation.\n\n\"The systems are so complicated,\" she explains, \"but it's all part of tribes deciding on their own terms, in their own ways, utilizing their own sovereignty [to decide] what approach is best for them.\"\n\nAs we explored blood quantum in this week's episode, we thought a primer of what, exactly, this system is and how it works \u2014 or doesn't \u2014 might be useful. Here's my interview with Elizabeth Rule, edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nFirst of all, what's blood quantum?\n\nBlood quantum simply is the amount of \"Indian blood\" that an individual possesses. The federal government, and specifically the Department of the Interior, issues what is called a \"Certified Degree of Indian Blood,\" and that is a card similar to an ID card. So the way that blood quantum is calculated is by using tribal documents, and usually it's a tribal official or a government official that calculates it.\n\nBut really it's a mathematical equation. So the quantum is a fraction of blood that is derived going back to the original enrollees of a tribe who were counted on Census rolls, and then their blood quantum was documented, and usually those original enrollees had a full blood quantum. Typically.\n\nHow did people know that those original enrollees had \"full blood quantum\"?\n\nWell, they didn't. And that's that's one of the major problems with blood quantum today is that a lot of times, the people taking the rolls were federal government officials who were unfamiliar with Native ways of establishing and defining their own communities.\n\nAnd so, for example, these officials would mark someone potentially as \"full blood\" when potentially that person was not. And that assumption was based on their appearance, on their level of cultural involvement with their community.\n\nBut a great example for how to understand this problem in real life is that there is a history of freedmen who are black individuals who were living as fully incorporated members of Indian tribes. And when these original roles were taken, oftentimes these freedmen were not included, even though those individuals may be of mixed heritage: black and Indian. Because of their black appearance, they were listed on a separate roll. And today, the ramification is that they do not have that original enrollee [in their past]. They do not have enough blood quantum, and therefore oftentimes cannot be extended tribal membership.\n\nCan you talk to me about how the concept of blood quantum came to be used for Native tribes?\n\nCertainly, American Indians have been racialized. But our primary identity continues to be a political one. Blood quantum really emerges as a way to trace race between generations of Native people starting at the turn of the 20th century. And again, I think it's helpful to understand the way that blood quantum works through another example that people may be more familiar with \u2014 and that's the \"one drop rule.\"\n\nBlood quantum emerged as a way to measure \"Indian-ness\" through a construct of race. So that over time, Indians would literally breed themselves out and rid the federal government of their legal duties to uphold treaty obligations.\n\nThe one drop rule measured the amount of \"black blood\" that black people had in society. And that ensured that every person who had at least one drop would be considered black and would be covered under these discriminatory laws and, even in the earlier days, enslaved.\n\nBlood quantum emerged as a way to measure \"Indian-ness\" through a construct of race. So that over time, Indians would literally breed themselves out and rid the federal government of their legal duties to uphold treaty obligations.\n\nOne of the questions that kept coming up is: OK, so why don't tribes just ditch these blood quantum requirements and switch to an enrollment requirement that uses lineal descent? (Lineal descent basically means that, if your ancestors were enrolled in a tribe, you can be, too.)\n\nThat is the question of the century. And first, I want to be clear that I don't intend to speak on behalf of any specific tribes or even on behalf of my own, but I'm happy to walk you through some of those arguments that exist in support of maintaining blood quantum requirements for tribal membership. ...\n\nThe thing that I've found to be most interesting about both arguments \u2014 in support and against blood quantum requirements \u2014 is the language of survival. So, lineal descendant supporters think about high memberships through the lens of existence as a resistance right. And so there's a desire to build up tribes' numbers and capacity in order to survive and perpetuate the tribe.\n\nOn the other side, those who defend blood quantum requirements also evoke this language of survival, and they look upon those blood quantum minimums as a way to preserve an already existing closed community that's very close and ... usually very culturally connected.\n\nEven though they're using what a lot of people say is a \"Colonialist construct\"?\n\nYes. And I don't think that anyone would argue that it isn't that. That history is very clear. But, tribes today of course have to adapt, and blood quantum for some tribes in their view has been a way to preserve their community.\n\nI also want to emphasize that it is the tribe's sovereign right to determine their own membership and whether that involves a blood quantum minimum or lineal descent system.\n\nUltimately their decision has to be respected in order to uphold tribal sovereignty.\n\nYou've used the phrase \"personal gains\" before to refer to some people who might've claimed Indian heritage. Can you walk me through what specifically those personal gains look like?\n\nYou hear every time a tribe changes over to lineal descent, or that there is a newly recognized tribe, for example, that usually there's a mass group that's interested in joining. And potentially, some of those incentives would be financial gain if the tribe, for example, has gaming revenue or other industries. Of course, there is a desire on some individuals' part to claim an identity for affirmative-action purposes. But again, I would say that is certainly the minority of this side of the cases. But it does happen and I just want to point it out again to show that there are difficulties on both sides and that there's not a clear-cut answer yet.\n\nIf each tribe is able to determine their own their own enrollment requirements, are there any tribes out there that you've heard of that are deciding to forego lineal descent and blood quantum \u2014 and deciding to use another completely different method?\n\nI have heard of one example in Canada, where a First Nation has decided to open enrollment to people who have no Indian ancestry at all. Meaning that those individuals don't meet the federal Canadian requirements of being a \"status Indian,\" and they also don't have that blood quantum or descendancy from an original enrollee. It's an extremely progressive and interesting move, and they're really changing the game.\n\nListen to our episode on blood quantum from earlier this week, and check out this essay from Savannah Maher, a former NPR producer, about her own struggle with blood quantum.", "keywords": ["requirements", "way", "tribe", "tribes", "quantum", "blood", "indian", "original", "thats", "native", "exactly"], "polarity": 0.17658166267389575, "subjectivity": 0.4690732568402472},

He also bundled, helping to raise an unknown amount of other people's money donated to Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBy comparison, the Center for Responsive Politics says San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer gave Democrats and liberal groups $91 million just in the 2015-16 election cycle.\n\nDespite his frequent checks to candidates and party committees, which raise their money under tight contribution limits, Weinstein never ventured into the deep end of political giving, where America's wealthiest political players write seven- or eight-figure checks to largely unregulated super PACs. And his companies, Miramax and the Weinstein Company, don't appear in federal disclosure reports.\n\nHis personal giving was outweighed by two other factors. He was a leader in a famously liberal industry. And as a bundler, he delivered much more in other people's money than he gave on his own. It all led to close connections with top-tier Democrats.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Weinstein's home in 2012 for a fundraiser, Weinstein told the $35,800-per-ticket crowd, \"You can make the case that he's the Paul Newman of American presidents.\"\n\nThe New York Times once described Weinstein as \"a family friend\" of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And when host Charlie Rose interviewed him on CBS This Morning in 2012, they had this exchange.\n\nRose: \"So Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, which of those three is your favorite?\"\n\nWeinstein: \"I have no favorites. It's like the Beatles.\"\n\nThis week, Barack and Michelle Obama, whose eldest daughter recently interned for the Weinstein Company, issued a statement saying they \"have been disgusted\" by the accounts of Weinstein's actions, while Hillary Clinton told CNN that his conduct \"was just intolerable in every way.\"\n\nMuch of Weinstein's cash went to either the Democratic National Committee or the party's House and Senate campaign committees. But the longest list of beneficiaries \u2014 now the longest list of politicians purging his contributions \u2014 is on the Senate side of the Capitol. Over the years, he gave to 30 Senate hopefuls \u2014 including Weinstein's sole Republican recipient, 2010 Senate candidate John Chachas in Nevada.\n\nThirteen Weinstein recipients are now sitting senators, and 12 have said they're getting rid of his money. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who got a total of $1,375 from Weinstein, said that she's contributing $10,000 to a women's shelter in Los Angeles. And Hillary Clinton has said she intends to donate Weinstein's past contributions to charity.\n\nMike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, said Weinstein's exit from Democratic politics won't matter. \"There may have been a time when one individual was make or break,\" Fraioli said, but it's gone. \"There's just so much money in the system now.\"", "keywords": ["cash", "clinton", "likely", "weinsteins", "money", "senate", "political", "impact", "hillary", "purge", "party", "democrats", "weinstein", "democratic", "obama", "low"], "polarity": 0.08364571035025582, "subjectivity": 0.42334464777646585},

But he's also been stymied by Congress and by the courts.\n\nHere's a look at what the Trump White House has accomplished on each of those 10 promises \u2014 and what it hasn't.\n\n1. \"We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall.\"\n\nThe border wall remains more aspiration than reality. The Department of Homeland Security is waiving environmental rules to speed up construction of prototypes near San Diego.\n\nBut so far, Mexico has balked at paying for the wall. And so has Congress. The House has appropriated nearly $1.6 billion for the first phase of construction, but the Senate hasn't.\n\n2. \"We are going to end catch and release.\"\n\nAdministration officials say they're following through on Trump's promise to end so-called catch and release. That's how many critics describe the policy that allowed many immigrants to go free until their court dates, which can often be years away because of court backlogs.\n\nIn practice, it's not clear that the Trump administration is handling these cases much differently than previous administrations did.\n\nBut there has been a dramatic drop in the number of people apprehended at the Southwest border since Trump took office \u2014 a 46 percent drop during the first seven months of the year compared to 2016, according to a DHS official. The total for March was the lowest in at least 17 years, although the numbers have started to creep back up since then.\n\n3. \"Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests are up more than 43 percent since late January compared to the same period in 2016, according to a DHS official. \"We are still continuing to prioritize our resources on those individuals that create and pose the greatest public safety and national security threat,\" the official said. Seventy-two percent of those arrested had criminal convictions, a much lower percentage than the final years of the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has pushed Congress for funding to hire more agents for ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But like funding for the border wall, Congress has yet to sign off.\n\n4. \"Block funding for sanctuary cities.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is trying to follow through on that promise to punish so-called sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. DOJ made some law enforcement grants contingent on whether those cities do more to help ICE.\n\nBut Chicago and California quickly took the administration to court. That's in addition to lawsuits filed earlier this year by San Francisco, Seattle and other self-described sanctuary cities.\n\n5. \"Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\"\n\nThis probably refers to two Obama-era executive actions including DACA, which protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation.\n\nThe Trump White House dropped its support for a related program called DAPA, which was supposed to help the parents of those children.\n\nBut so far, the White House has allowed DACA to continue, much to the dismay of immigration hard-liners. Texas and other states are threatening to sue if the administration doesn't pull its support for DACA by Sept. 5.\n\n6. \"We are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\"\n\nThis is part of what Trump's travel ban executive order was supposed to do.\n\nThe order Trump signed just a week after taking office would have blocked travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration says are known havens for terrorists.\n\nFederal courts put the original order on hold. But the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of the travel ban to take effect until it can hear legal challenges to the ban in the fall.\n\n7. \"We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.\"\n\nTrump pointed out in Phoenix last year that immigrants with criminal records can wind up staying in the U.S. because their home country won't take them back. The White House has reportedly cut the number of non-cooperative countries from 23 to 12. Immigration hawks say that's a big win, and that the administration deserves more credit for it.\n\n8. \"We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.\"\n\nFor years, Congress has required the Department of Homeland Security to create a system to track everyone who comes in and out of the country using biometric technologies like facial recognition or fingerprint scanners.\n\nIn recent years, a majority of new undocumented immigrants have overstayed temporary visas, while the number crossing the border illegally has fallen.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is testing a few prototype systems at U.S. airports this summer. But experts say a comprehensive solution that will work at more than 300 land, sea and air ports of entry remains a long way off.\n\n9. \"We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\"\n\nIn the spring, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to \"Buy American\" and \"Hire American,\" and urging others to do the same.\n\nBut critics point out that Trump's own companies continue to hire foreign guest workers and manufacture overseas. And just as the White House's \"Made in America\" week was underway in July, the administration announced it would allow an additional 15,000 temporary foreign workers.\n\n10. \"We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the White House threw its support behind the RAISE Act, which would prioritize immigrants with valuable skills and high-paying U.S. job offers, and gradually reduce the number of other foreign nationals who can reunite with their families already living in the U.S. But there seems to be little enthusiasm for the bill in the Senate.", "keywords": ["wall", "trump", "white", "illegal", "fact", "administration", "order", "house", "fight", "check", "border", "immigration", "president", "congress", "immigrants"], "polarity": 0.059213277253049985, "subjectivity": 0.36531139315230216},

Charlie Dent Discusses How House Will Approach Immigration Bill\n\nNPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with the Pennsylvania Republican about how the House is looking to pass a DACA bill. Dent has asked Speaker Ryan to bring two bipartisan bills to a vote, which he thinks have a chance to pass.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nSo the shutdown is over. The Federal Government is open at least for the next 16 days when the next budget deadline looms and federal funding runs out again.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nNow the deal that ended the shutdown rests on a promise - a promise by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on immigration. At stake is the fate of the DREAMers - these are the immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children - and also the future of DACA, the program that has protected many of those DREAMers from being deported.\n\nHere's the rub. Promises made in the Senate may or may not fly in the House. And House Democrats and Republicans are far from united on the way forward on an immigration deal.\n\nKELLY: Well, let's talk to one of those House Republicans, Congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. He is on the line now from his district. Hey there, Congressman.\n\nCHARLIE DENT: Hi, Mary Louise. How are you?\n\nKELLY: Hi. I'm well, thanks. And thanks for taking the time. Let me start by asking your reaction to the shutdown which of course is over now. From where you sit, what did the shutdown accomplish?\n\nDENT: Well, this government shutdown in my view was entirely pointless. It was thoroughly unnecessary. What we need actually is a bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement. And we also recognize that there's not likely to be one of those until we have some kind of path forward on the DREAMer, DACA issue tied to border security.\n\nSo it seems now that we've established some type of a path forward, so I'm hopeful that we'll be able to get off of this treadmill of continuing resolutions so that we can, you know, really get on a better path towards budgetary stability and hopefully a resolution on these DREAMers who came to this country no fault of their own.\n\nKELLY: You've mentioned the importance of a bipartisan deal. How likely is that in the House? I mean, the House last year passed one significant piece of legislation, which was the tax overhaul. And you did it without Democratic support.\n\nDENT: Yeah. That's a different matter. That was done through reconciliation. Any changes to DACA will go through a more regular order process where there would be a requirement for a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. So the only way to pass a DACA bill will be in a bipartisan manner certainly in the Senate and also in the House. There are not 218 Republican votes for some kind of a DACA border security bill. And even if we did have 218 Republican votes in the House for such a bill, you know, to what end, I mean, 'cause the Senate wouldn't take it up. So bottom line is the only path forward is a bipartisan one on the DREAMers and border security.\n\nKELLY: Congressman, is it a given to you that there needs to be a big, sweeping immigration bill that takes on all of this at once, or might there be some value to just working on DACA, getting that passed and then turning attention to the other outstanding issues?\n\nDENT: I prefer this incremental approach. You know, DACA, border security - we can manage that together along with maybe a little bit of the diversity visa reform. I prefer dealing with this in smaller pieces. Rather than a comprehensive bill, I would recommend a comprehensive process so that you would have perhaps multiple bills but dealing with, you know, different issues.\n\nKELLY: And did - I mean, you were in the House yesterday I assume to pass this vote that's - you know, ended up ending the shutdown. I mean, were you seeing groups of bipartisan lawmakers actually sounding open to a path forward here?\n\nDENT: Yes, I've seen that. Now, the compromise in the Senate - it's kind of interesting that this great compromise in the Senate changed the bill that the House sent them by one week - from February the 16th to February the 8th, eight days. I mean, that's - that was the big change, and - but what was more important than I guess that change was the path forward that there's - there seems to be a sincere desire on both sides to move on DACA and DREAMers. And we have to do that because if we don't do that, there's not going to be a budget agreement.\n\nKELLY: You sound optimistic, I have to say, which is - given that we're just coming off of a government shutdown and the - you know, the latest in a round of continuing resolutions just over the issue of keeping the government open - forget fixing some of the huge problems that need to be addressed - I mean, what causes you to feel like this is something you actually see a solution to?\n\nDENT: What causes the optimism? Well, I'm an Eagles fan.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDENT: And they won. And we're going to win the Super Bowl. But...\n\nKELLY: So you're having a good week. There you go.\n\nDENT: I guess, you know, you might want to ask me in a few weeks. If this process breaks down in the Senate, then you know, obviously my optimism would've been misplaced. But I do think that we should be optimistic about a path forward. The real issue - where this is going to get very interesting - if the Senate does pass this this immigration bill with border security. And they'll have over 60 votes. It'll be a strong bipartisan vote, I suspect. Then the pressure will be on the House of Representatives really to act. And I would encourage our leadership, the speaker to allow for a vote. And that's the way I think we should proceed.\n\nKELLY: That's Pennsylvania Republican Charlie Dent. Congressman, thanks so much for your time.\n\nDENT: Thank you so much - really appreciate it, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: And go, Eagles.\n\nDENT: Go, Eagles. Fly, Eagles; fly.\n\nKELLY: (Laughter) OK. Thanks again.\n\nDENT: Thank you. [CORRECTION:A previous headline and Web introduction to this story incorrectly identified Charlie Dent as a senator.

Advocates are looking to follow suit with ballot measures in Utah, Missouri and Idaho in 2018.\n\nVirginia may also have another go at expansion after the Legislature thwarted Gov. Terry McAuliffe's attempt to expand Medicaid. Virginia voters elected Democrat Ralph Northam to succeed McAuliffe as governor in January, and Democrats made inroads in the state legislature, too.\n\nAn exit poll of Virginia voters on Election Day found that 39 percent of them ranked health care as their No. 1 issue. More than three-quarters of the Virginians in this group voted for Democrats.\n\nA study from the Urban Institute may shed some light on why Medicaid eligibility remains a pressing problem: medical debt. While personal debts related to health care are on the decline overall, they remain far higher in states that didn't expand Medicaid.\n\nIn some cases, struggles with medical debt can be all-consuming.\n\nGeneva Wilson is in her mid-40s and lives outside of Lowry City, Mo. She has a long history of health problems, including a blood disorder, depression and a painful misalignment of the hip joint called hip dysplasia.\n\nShe's managed to find some peace living in a small cabin in the woods. She keeps chickens, raises rabbits and has a garden. Her long-term goal is to live off her land by selling what she raises at farmers markets.\n\nHer health has made it hard to keep a job and obtain the insurance that typically comes with it. And Missouri's stringent Medicaid requirements \u2014 which exclude nondisabled adults without children \u2014 have kept her from getting public assistance.\n\nSince graduating from college more than 20 years ago, Wilson has mostly had to pay out of pocket for medical care, and that's left her with a seemingly endless pile of medical debt.\n\n\"As soon as I get it down a little bit, something happens, and I have to start all over again,\" Wilson says.\n\nRight now her medical debt stands at about $3,000, which she pays down by $50 a month. She desperately needs a hip replacement, but she canceled the surgery because, even with deeply discounted rate from a nearby hospital, she can't afford it.\n\n\"Approximately $11,000 is what would come out of my pocket to pay for the hip. That's my entire pretax wage from last year,\" Wilson says. \"So it's kind of on hold, but I don't know if I can survive the year without going ahead and trying to get it done.\"\n\nFor many people like Wilson, medical debt can be nearly as problematic as their illness. In 2015, 30.6 percent of Missouri adults ages 18 to 64 had past due medical debt, the seventh-highest rate in the country. Kansas, at 27 percent, had the 15th highest rate. In Maine, which voted to expand Medicaid this week, it was 27.7 percent.\n\nResearchers Aaron Sojourner and Ezra Golbertstein of the University of Minnesota studied financial data from 2012 to 2015 for people who would be eligible for Medicaid where it was expanded.\n\nThey found that in states that didn't expand, the percentage of low-income, nonelderly adults with unpaid medical bills dropped from 47 to 40 percent within three years.\n\n\"The economy improved and maybe other components of the ACA contributed to a 7 percentage point reduction,\" Sojourner says. \"Where they did expand Medicaid, it fell by almost twice as much.\"\n\nThose states saw an average drop of 13 percentage points, from 43 to 30 percent.\n\nIn Kansas, the rate of medical debt for nonelderly adults fell by 4 percentage points to 27 percent. In Missouri, the rate dropped 4 points to 31 percent, according to the Urban Institute. In Maine, it dropped only 1.4 percentage points between 2012 and 2015.\n\nMedicaid, as opposed to private insurance, is the key, says The Urban Institute's Kyle Caswell, because it requires little out-of-pocket costs.\n\nEven if Medicaid patients need lots of care, there aren't on the hook for big out-of-pocket costs in the same way someone with private insurance might be.\n\n\"We would certainly expect that their risk to out-of-pocket expenses to be much lower, and ultimately the risk of unpaid bills to ultimately be also lower,\" Caswell says.\n\nBut Medicaid's debt-reducing advantages over private insurance could disappear under the leadership of the Trump administration.\n\nShortly after Seema Verma was confirmed as the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, she and Tom Price, then head Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the governors outlining their plans for Medicaid.\n\nThe letter encouraged states to consider measures that would make their Medicaid programs operate more like commercial health insurance, including introducing premiums and copayments for emergency room visits.\n\nVerma says that by giving recipients more \"skin in the game,\" they will take more responsibility for the cost of care and save the program money.\n\nRepublican proposals in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would have eliminated or limited Medicaid expansion. And that would have affected the last few years' downward trend in medical debt.\n\n\"Anything that reduces access to Medicaid most likely would have the reverse effect of what of we're seeing in our paper,\" Caswell says. \"Reduced access to Medicaid would likely increase exposure to medical out-of-pocket spending and ultimately unpaid medical bills.\"\n\nAs Geneva Wilson tends to her chickens, she says she tries not to think too much about her medical debt or how she'll pay for that hip replacement.\n\n\"It's going to the point where, if I were to go shopping at Walmart, I would have to get one of the carts you drive because I can't manage,\" she says.\n\nWilson has already sold her jewelry, some furniture and a wood stove to pay down her debts. Now there's not much left to sell except her cabin and her land.\n\n\"Probably the homestead and garden that I want, that I've been wanting and trying to work for, I don't think they are a viable dream either,\" Wilson says. \"It's hard losing your dreams.\"\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KCUR and Kaiser Health News.

And at Thursday's championship parade, you'd likely hear many of the same full-throated chants that we heard right after the win. The Eagles fight song, obviously. Some colorful suggestions for what the vanquished Tom Brady could do to himself, also obviously. And then another, more charged exhortation: Free Meek Mill!\n\nMeek Mill, whose real name is Robert Williams, is one of the highest profile rappers ever to come from Philly. And when the Eagles ran out onto the field on Super Bowl Sunday, they did so over Meek's \"Dreams and Nightmares,\" a song that they had been playing at the team's practices since the playoffs began.\n\nThe Eagles picked \"Dreams and Nightmares\" as their hype song for functional reasons \u2014 it's a song about overcoming long odds and constructed to make you feel like you can run through a brick wall \u2014 but there was something political about the choice as well. Meek had been on probation for nearly a decade stemming from a gun conviction in 2008, when he was 21. Then last year, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating those probation terms. He had a long and spotty probation history, with a grip of failed drug tests and missed court appearances, some of which extended his probation.\n\nNone of which is especially remarkable for people on probation, which is exactly why he has become a poster boy for critics of the criminal justice system. They point out that failing a drug test, or driving outside of the county, or failure to hold down a job are not jailable offenses for anyone but probationers. For Meek, the violations that finally got him sent to prison were an airport fight and a reckless driving charge for popping a wheelie on a motorcycle in a video he posted to Instagram, even though charges in both instances were dropped. (Several Eagles players had expressed public support for Meek after his sentencing and showed up at a rally in Center City last fall to protest his incarceration.)\n\nThere are many, many people of far less means than Meek Mill in similar binds \u2014 ostensibly free, but constrained by their probation terms. (Imagine trying to find a job or public housing with a felony conviction and restrictions on where you can travel.) There are currently more Americans on probation than on parole, in prison or in jail combined \u2014 and the racial disparities in probation are as stark as they are in every other part of our criminal justice system. A 2014 study by the Urban Institute found that across four different counties in the U.S., black probationers were 55 percent more likely to have their probation revoked than white people were.\n\nMeek's story comes just as Philadelphia rethinks its approach to crime and punishment. For decades, Philly's district attorneys have been notoriously tough on crime, which is one reason the city currently has the highest incarceration rate of the 10 largest U.S. cities. But the current mayor, Jim Kenney, ran on a platform of police reform and getting rid of stop-and-frisk. And the new DA, Larry Krasner, is a former defense lawyer who made his name suing the police department, wants to abolish cash bail and was championed by activists from Occupy Philly and Black Lives Matter. (As you might imagine, that has not always engendered them to the city's police and prosecutorial brass.)\n\nIt's fitting, then, that the Eagles managed to smuggle a little of this messy context, however briefly and however elliptically, into the Super Bowl. The NFL tried its best to hermetically seal the game off from the tensions roiling the wider world. Any notion that the NFL existed outside the sphere of politics was always a tortured fiction, and it was demolished for good this season, when the biggest storyline was the on-field protests around race and the criminal justice system. In a move that seemed especially aimed at reassuring fans who might have been turned off by that kneeling, and felt it unpatriotic, there was an especially showy celebration of several World War II veterans during the coin toss. There was no visible protest on display that day, not even from Malcolm Jenkins, the Eagles outspoken safety. But there was Meek, at least, if only in sound and spirit.", "keywords": ["especially", "song", "system", "probation", "little", "protest", "super", "justice", "sneaked", "meek", "prison", "bowl", "eagles"], "polarity": 0.0880828966355282, "subjectivity": 0.44139230652388545},

Trump's Question Answered\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. David Ake/AP J. David Ake/AP\n\n\"So this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? ... [Jefferson] was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue?\" \u2014 President Trump, Aug. 15, 2017\n\nThe president made this statement Tuesday while jabbing at reporters over a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAnd he used one of his standard rhetorical techniques, \"whataboutism.\"\n\nWhile defending the protesters and claiming that they weren't all white supremacists, he changed the subject to attack others. \"What about the alt-left?\" he said, when asked about the white nationalist alt-right. (\"Alt-left\" is a term seemingly invented for whataboutism, making liberals seem like the moral equivalents of the \"alt-right,\" whose members coined that term themselves.)\n\nThe president's whataboutism on history is the focus here.\n\n\"Are we going to take down statues of George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?\" Trump asked, given Washington's and Jefferson's slave ownership. He added, \"You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nWell, let's take on those questions. The president is not the first person to ask.\n\nWashington did own slaves \u2014 and does not get a pass for freeing them at the end of his life. Jefferson was a \"major slave owner,\" too \u2014 and is even more to be criticized, because he understood that slavery was wrong, calling it a \"moral depravity\" and a \"hideous blot.\"\n\nNor were they alone among our Founding Fathers: James Madison was a slave owner; even Benjamin Franklin owned two slaves before the practice was banned in Pennsylvania. Slavery was so deeply entrenched in the economy that it touched nearly everyone who lived before the Civil War, even those who did not own a slave.\n\nThis is an awkward reality for the keepers of memorials and historic sites. Keepers of the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's home, have been forced to wrestle with the reality that he took Indian land, used enslaved laborers on multiple plantations and even personally chased escaped slaves. The Hermitage has responded by expanding displays showing the dark side of this historic figure, but it is not planning to tear down the house.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" them? Must they all go if Robert E. Lee goes?\n\nNot necessarily, because they are not all the same.\n\nSome figures stood for something larger. Washington guided the foundation of a country that eventually preserved freedom for all. Jefferson authored the Declaration of Independence, in which a single phrase \u2014 \"that all men are created equal\" \u2014 became a hammer that later generations would use to help smash the chains of slavery.\n\nIt's possible to make a case for honoring such men, so long as we are also honest about their flaws. They were participants in a great experiment in self-government, which has expanded over time to embrace more and more people of all races, not to mention women, too.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" Lee? What did he stand for?\n\nLee, who is connected by marriage to the family of Washington, resigned from the Army to fight against his country, on the Confederate side in the Civil War.\n\nThen and later, Confederate apologists dismissed the idea that they were fighting to defend slavery. They said they were fighting for \"states' rights\" or against Northern oppression. But conflict over slavery was what drove the fight for states' rights and divided the country for years before the war. The election of Abraham Lincoln, a president who was critical of slavery, triggered the rebellion.\n\nAnd the Confederate vice president, Alexander H. Stephens, was more frank than others in stating the rebels' aims. In an 1861 speech, he declared that the \"cornerstone\" of the Confederacy was \"that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\nOther Confederates may have fought for different reasons; it is said that Lee went over to the rebel side because he could not bear to fight against his native Virginia. But Stephens' \"cornerstone\" speech accurately describes the larger cause that Lee willingly served and generally accepted: a drive to overturn the idea of equality, which Stephens called an \"error.\" This cause was the reason that many Confederate statues were built in the era of Jim Crow segregation, from after Reconstruction to the civil rights movement starting in the 1950s. Aside from Southern \"heritage\" or \"pride,\" many explicitly represented white supremacy.\n\nThere is still a case to be made for Lee as a brilliant general, who won battle after battle and kept his army together for years, even though it was massively outnumbered and undersupplied. He is a significant figure in the American story.\n\nUlysses S. Grant, the general who defeated him, gave the best epitaph of Lee, saying the Confederate general \"had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought.\"\n\nBut let's be honest. In Charlottesville over the weekend, the \"Unite the Right\" protesters chanted \"blood and soil\"; others listened to Richard Spencer, who has called for an all-white homeland. Members of one group, Identity Evropa, \"seem to revel in goading counter-protesters into violent clashes,\" according to a profile of a member on KQED. Counterprotesters were indeed goaded into clashes \u2014 and a car, allegedly driven by an Ohio man on the white-nationalist side, drove into them, killing a woman.\n\nIs it remotely possible that Spencer and Identity Evropa and the driver of a Dodge Challenger came to defend the statue of Lee because of his skill in military tactics and strategy?\n\nTo have such defenders says a lot about the cause that Lee represented. To have the president of the United States compare Lee to Washington is simply, factually wrong.", "keywords": ["figures", "white", "whatabout", "fact", "washington", "jefferson", "cause", "question", "answered", "historical", "check", "slavery", "lee", "confederate", "slave", "trumps", "president"], "polarity": 0.06441643323996266, "subjectivity": 0.4289729225023342},

That's where the measure hit a snafu late Friday night, triggering the stalemate. The House later passed the 17-day extension by a 266-150 vote.\n\nShortly before the Monday procedural vote was set to begin, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced that he would vote to reopen the government along with enough Democrats needed to advance the bill. After 24 hours of furious negotiation over plans to consider immigration legislation in the coming weeks, the Senate voted to move forward with the continuing resolution, which would fund the government through Feb. 8.\n\nIn exchange for his support, Schumer said, he has received assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that if an agreement isn't reached by then, the GOP leader will bring a vote to the floor on legislation to grant legal status to those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, roughly 700,000 immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children. The bill also extends the expired Children's Health Insurance Program for six years.\n\nMcConnell says Democrats caved because they realized holding out for a DACA deal tied to the funding deal was not wise politically.\n\n\"I think if we've learned anything during this process it's that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the American people didn't understand,\" McConnell said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nSchumer, however, argued that blame for the weekend-long stalemate lay at the president's feet.\n\n\"The reason the Republican majority had such difficulty finding consensus is they could never get a firm grip on what the president of their party wanted to do. These days, you never know who to deal with when it comes to the Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"The Republican leaders told me to work out a deal with the White House. The White House said, work it out with Republican leaders on the Hill. Separately, President Trump turned away from not one, but two bipartisan compromises. Each would have avoided this shutdown.\"\n\nIn statement later Monday, Trump said that with the government on the path to reopening, the administration would work on immigration legislation \u2014 but \"only if it's good for our country.\"\n\n\"I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, border patrol, first responders and insurance for vulnerable children,\" Trump said. \"As I've always said, once the government is funded, my administration will work towards solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if and only if it's good for our country.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dodged questions at the daily briefing as to whether that would include a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, which many hard-line conservatives oppose. And she insisted that the president has been clear about what he wants in an immigration bill, despite shifting positions over the past week that even GOP leaders have complained about.\n\nWith the measure moving forward, it will now be hard for Democrats to argue they extracted many concessions from GOP leaders. McConnell's promise is just that \u2014 a promise. \"Some of us struggle to trust him,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told NPR's Morning Edition, \"because of the famously vulgar way that President Trump sort of blew up the last time that Sens. [Lindsey] Graham and [Dick] Durbin offered him a bipartisan deal [on immigration].\"\n\nDemocrats were trying to frame the deal as a temporary victory, though. Senate Minority Whip Durbin took the floor to call the DACA issue the \"civil rights issue of our time\" and underscore the importance of passing an immigration bill by the new deadline, which he said McConnell had assured them would be on a level playing field.\n\nWhile many Senate Democrats had remained entrenched in their opposition to any funding deal that didn't include a DACA fix, a growing number of moderate lawmakers were wary of an extended shutdown fight. Most of the endangered Democrats who are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won all voted to advance the measure, except for Montana Sen. Jon Tester.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who faces a potentially competitive re-election this fall, sounded optimistic about the agreement.\n\n\"What you have is pretty much an ironclad commitment that if we don't resolve this \u2014 and that's what we're going to try to do with the Graham bill \u2014 resolve the DACA issue by Feb. 8, the commitment is you go to the floor with a neutral bill, like a shell, and you let the Senate process work,\" Nelson said.\n\nMany Democrats had worried that the Republican talking point that Democrats were siding with \"illegal immigrants\" over the military and government would resonate with voters as the stalemate extended into the workweek Monday morning.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted that argument himself.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who has argued for tougher immigration standards, also echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"Shutting down the government and depriving American citizens of services because you want amnesty for illegal immigrants is a massive political blunder,\" said Cotton.\n\nTrump has generally kept a low profile during the shutdown. He canceled a planned trip to Florida where he hoped to celebrate the first anniversary of his inauguration with a high-dollar fundraising party.\n\nAides say the president spent the weekend telephoning lawmakers and working with staff to minimize fallout from shuttered government operations.\n\nSanders pushed back on allegations from Schumer and other Democrats that Trump was absent from negotiations over the weekend and never reached out to their side. \"What the president did clearly worked,\" Sanders countered. \"The vote just came in 81-18.\"\n\nA group of about 20 senators met for several hours on Saturday and again on Sunday afternoon to hash out the plan that ultimately allowed both sides to back down from their increasingly entrenched positions and vote to reopen the government.\n\nRepresentatives from those talks briefed leaders Sunday afternoon, but the suspense dragged out for nearly six hours before McConnell made his announcement.\n\nSeveral of the senators in the bipartisan group said they worried a prolonged shutdown could become harder to fix and would cause greater damage to the country.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., who is one of several Democrats up for re-election in states where Trump won in 2016, joined the talks. \"One of the things we learned from the last shutdown was that as time goes on, positions harden,\" Heitkamp said. \"Resolution gets more difficult the longer we wait.\"\n\nHowever, more liberal senators \u2014 including several potential 2020 hopefuls such as Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 all voted against the measure, standing firm over the DACA issue.\n\nTwo conservative GOP senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, also voted no, though they have repeatedly opposed on principle any continuing resolutions as a way to keep the government funded.\n\nNPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley and NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["shutdown", "bringing", "trump", "funding", "signs", "bill", "senate", "deal", "house", "vote", "democrats", "end", "immigration", "president"], "polarity": 0.00861952861952862, "subjectivity": 0.4001515151515151},

Bob Marshall in a Northern Virginia district near Washington, D.C. Marshall had held the seat since 1992 and had been a prominent religious conservative in Virginia politics.\n\nThe race was one of this year's most high profile, drawing national and international attention.\n\nMarshall refused to debate Roem and said in an interview earlier this year that \"Danica clearly is out here doing this for making a marker in the national character that you can engage in this behavior \u2014 which clearly goes against the laws of nature and nature's God \u2014 and hold public office to make decisions on behalf of the common good. ...

She rarely made her identity a topic on the campaign trail.\n\n\"What motivates me to run is the fact that my mother has been commuting up and down Route 28 for more than 30 years ... and Del.

I can smell the desert and the cigarette smoke through the phone.\n\n\"And I guess the answer is that it's not not because he's Native. You know?\"\n\nI do know.\n\nShe and I were raised by different tribes on reservations 3,000 miles apart. As children, though, we internalized the same directive: Find yourself a Native man. Good blood for your babies.\n\nI know how messed up it sounds. But it's about survival.\n\nIt's called blood quantum. Lots of Native nations, including my friend's, use it to determine who can and can't enroll as a citizen. But even in tribes like my own that use different enrollment policies, the notion that Indigeneity can be quantified \u2014 that it's our \"blood\" that makes us Native or not \u2014 is impossible to avoid.\n\nHere's how it works: Track down a tribal census document from the 1800s. Assume every person listed was a certified, \"full-blooded\" Indian and do the math from there. Choose an arbitrary fraction to serve as your citizenship cut-off. And if anyone's personal fraction happens to fall below that standard, they're out of luck. Traditional or not, blood quantum is the law of the land. You either buy in or you die out. Just another colonial reality we have little choice but to participate in.\n\nFor me, the hierarchy has always been clear\u2014if not Mashpee Wampanoag then Aquinnah or Herring Pond. If not Wampanoag then Narragansett. Then Pequot. And if you find yourself too far from home to lock down an Eastern Woodlands man to father your children, he damn well better be Indigenous to somewhere on this continent.\n\nFind yourself a Native man. Good blood for your babies. I know how messed up it sounds. But it's about survival.\n\nIncidentally, the man I love now looks uncannily like John Smith from the Disney Pocahontas movie. He is German. Maybe English. He's not sure how much of either, and no one ever asks. Sometimes he'll ask me, \"Is there any part of you that wants me to be different?\" What he means is, do I ever find myself wishing he were Native. Three years into our relationship, I'm still not sure how to answer.\n\nIt's odd to think about high school-aged me, on the lookout for an Indian baby daddy. Especially because, even now, I'm not sure if motherhood is something I want for myself. But at 14 and 15, I was meeting Native boys on the powwow circuit and running equations in my head. How much Indian \"blood\" did he have? What kind? Did his fraction plus mine equal legitimate tribal citizenship for our offspring? Would his brown skin and high cheekbones survive the wild labyrinth of our genes so that my babies might not have to fight to be seen as Indigenous?\n\nOn the phone, my friend tells me that her current beau checks most of these boxes. They've only been together for two months, but she's done the math. (1/4 + 5/8) \u00f7 2 = 7/16 and just like that, their babies will be Indian enough. The hard part is over. All that's left to do is fall in love and stay there.\n\nHere's the thing about blood quantum: it's not real. It has no basis in biology or genetics or any Indigenous tradition I'm aware of. It's a colonial invention designed to breed us out of existence. But it's got all these smart people\u2014traditionalists, university students, Indigenous language revitalists\u2014running around doing mental math, convinced it's our best shot at keeping our cultures alive.\n\nI won't pretend that I'm above it. The prospect of having kids even more mixed than I am makes me anxious. If, in a century, the Wampanoag tribe no longer exists\u2014if we lose our land, our traditions, our language\u2014will it be my fault? If my babies end up looking like him, if they feel more white than Wampanoag, have I wasted my ancestors' sacrifices?\n\nMy mom's five-year-old foster sons are blonde-haired and blue-eyed and right now they're learning to count in W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak. P\u00e2saq, nees, nuhsh, y\u00e2w, the words sound at home in their voices. \"Savannah,\" they asked me once, \"How come you're Wampanoag?\" And I said, \"How come you are?\" They considered the question for a moment, then one of them piped up, \"We're Wampanoag because our mom made us that way.\" I knew just what he meant because mine did, too.\n\nMy boyfriend also wants to learn the language. When we visit my mom, he points to labels placed around the house to help the kids build vocabulary and reads them aloud. Ushq\u00f4t, kunakuneek, wun\u00f4k, I repeat each word with the correct pronunciation and he tries again.\n\nI love him because he can gut a fish and make a friendship bracelet, because he's 6'3\" and he sings in the bathtub, because he asks for one French braid when he wants to look fancy and two when he needs cheering up. Do I want him to be different? God, no. But when I think about the future\u2014not just mine but my tribe's, all of Indian Country's\u2014I start to doubt myself.\n\nOne thing I know now that I didn't three years ago: If we have kids together someday, it won't be their blood that makes them Wampanoag.\n\nMost days I think I'm done doing mental math. No more worrying that I'm being selfish, that I'm letting colonialism do its job. But when the guilt and the self-suspicion creep up on me, he will be there.

And if he doesn't, let me know, and I'll attack him.\"\n\nThose are the words of (now) President Trump, but they're not from any current controversy. They're from 2009, from an interview in the ESPN documentary Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?, which aired that same year. Trump is talking about Charley Steiner, the longtime ESPN sportscaster who's now the play-by-play radio announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1980s, Steiner was the announcer for the New Jersey Generals, the football team Trump had bought that was part of the upstart USFL, a professional football league that lasted three seasons playing in the spring instead of, like the NFL, in the fall.\n\nThe words come shortly after filmmaker Mike Tollin tells Trump something that Steiner said regarding his purchase of the Generals in 1983, in the league's second year: \"[Trump] figured that he could buy his way onto the back page of the New York Post, he could move to Page Six, the gossip page, and then ultimately, the front page. Donald Trump was no longer a Donald, but the Donald.\"\n\nAs you know, the part about making it to the front page eventually came true, though Steiner probably wouldn't have predicted how.\n\nSmall Potatoes, which is available to rent on streaming services, provides some interesting additional context \u2014 along with his flirtation with buying the Buffalo Bills shortly before his 2016 presidential campaign began \u2014 for Trump's recent condemnation of NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality. Trump has gone so far as to proclaim via Twitter that owners should prohibit these protests and should fire anyone who engages in them. It's worth remembering that his history with the NFL is long. (So, in fact, is his history with ESPN, which made this documentary he greatly disliked, and with whom he also got into it recently over ESPN commentator Jemele Hill calling him a white supremacist.)\n\nTollin's thesis in Small Potatoes \u2014 which later earned him a public feud over the film with Trump that did take place on Page Six \u2014 is that the USFL was killed by Trump's stubborn insistence on the doomed idea of moving USFL football to the fall to compete directly with the NFL. Players interviewed for the film, including stars like Jim Kelly and Steve Young, say they had a feeling the push to the fall was a bad idea. The USFL was small but growing. Why throw yourself against the incredibly powerful NFL? But Trump didn't want to coexist as a smaller league and wait to see what happened. He went after a bigger prize.\n\nTrump became the public face of a lawsuit against the NFL by the USFL in 1986, arguing that the NFL constituted a monopoly that, among other things, prevented the USFL from getting fall television contracts. Ultimately, the jury believed that the monopoly existed, but not that the USFL had been damaged by it in the way it claimed. It awarded the USFL $3. One possible explanation for the lack of damages? The NFL had argued that the USFL had planned not to actually play separately in the fall, but to force the NFL to merge with it and adopt at least some of its teams. That could mean the USFL wasn't really harmed by not getting TV contracts it never intended to get.\n\nThe verdict was for $3 plus interest, actually \u2014 a check for $3.76 that Tollin has on hand and gives to Trump during the prickly 2009 interview. The tiny verdict \u2014 the arguably empty victory \u2014 quickly led to the USFL folding altogether.\n\nBecause political lenses can be so disorienting, it can be worthwhile to look back at documents from before politics really dominated a person's image. Here, Tollin makes an argument in 2009 that Trump was impatient and overeager for a confrontation with the NFL. And no less a figure of the 1980s than Burt Reynolds, who was also involved with the league, says in an interview that Trump's \"dream was to be in the National Football League. And they didn't want him.\"\n\nThat's not the way Trump sees the story or his interest in the league, and he's steadfast in his arguments to Tollin that he was right, that spring football was never going to be a success. What would have happened if the league had stayed in the spring and tried to grow gradually is speculation, for both men.\n\nAt the end of the 2009 interview with Tollin, while taking off his microphone, Trump asks Tollin whether he agrees or disagrees with Trump's thinking about what the league should have done. Tollin suggests that he thinks the league could have carried on for a while playing in the spring, had it continued as it was. \"It would have been small potatoes,\" Trump says, patting Tollin on the shoulder. \"Have a good time.\"\n\nThe documentary \"Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?\" can be found as an episode within Volume 1 of ESPN's series 30 For 30, which is available to rent on platforms including iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.", "keywords": ["trump", "usfl", "small", "tollin", "potatoes", "nfl", "long", "donald", "football", "page", "league", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.033650629673356955, "subjectivity": 0.373974321133412},

President Trump said it in a Thursday speech in West Virginia, and House Speaker Paul Ryan mentions it a lot.\n\nThe claim: The U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\n\nThe short answer: That is generally true, though many businesses end up paying far less than the statutory rate.\n\nThe long answer: The U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate at least among advanced economies. Compared with nations in the OECD \u2014 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of highly developed countries \u2014 the U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate in the world. The top corporate tax rate in the U.S., a combination of federal and state and local taxes, is nearly 39 percent this year. That's well above most other OECD nations.\n\nTrump would like to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and Ryan has reportedly said that 20 percent to 25 percent is more realistic. Either way, doing so would pull the U.S. well away from the top of this list.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnyway: The \"mostly\" in the \"mostly true\" here comes from the fact that a couple of other places beat out the U.S., outside of OECD countries. According to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the U.S. comes in third out of 188, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. (Tax Foundation's list includes some U.S. territories.)\n\nHowever, it's not quite that simple. Those rates above are the statutory rates \u2014 the rates set by law. And that is not the rate that many companies in the U.S. end up paying. Deductions and credits help push down businesses' total tax liability, meaning that many companies end up paying far less than the statutory rate. Here is the average effective tax rate for U.S. corporations.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe U.S. is still toward the top of the spectrum, but it's nowhere near the ultra-high level (relative to other countries) that the statutory rate is at.\n\nWhen many politicians talk about overhauling the tax code, both on the corporate and income side, they talk about this discrepancy between effective rates and statutory rates \u2014 the phrase often used is \"broaden the base, lower the rates\" (or some configuration thereof). The idea is to lower the statutory rates but close some of the loopholes that push those effective rates so far from the statutory rates.\n\nOne other way to put corporate tax rates in perspective: the total size of corporate revenue. That has fallen off over time.\n\nAnd on this measure, U.S. corporate taxation isn't all that big compared with other countries'. As of 2014, U.S. corporate tax revenues were at around 2.2 percent of the GDP. The OECD average was 2.8 percent.\n\nLikewise, the share of government revenue as a whole that comes from corporations has fallen off over time, a fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders highlighted on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 the idea being that the government has grown less reliant on corporate tax revenue.\n\nLoading...\n\nThere are a number of factors at play here. The top corporate tax rate has been lowered over the years, for example; in the late 1960s, it was as high as 52.8 percent.\n\nBut it's also true that over time, businesses have increasingly paid taxes through the income tax code, as the Tax Foundation points out. \"C-corporations\" pay corporate taxes, but \"S-corporations,\" also known as \"pass-through entities,\" pay through the individual income tax code. S-corporations include many small businesses run by middle-class Americans, but some very wealthy Americans, including Trump, also own S-corporations, as the New York Times pointed out this spring.\n\nAll this jargon has been important to the tax overhaul fight already, as Republicans have considered imposing a cap on pass-through income. That is \u2014 the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent is the top rate an S-corporation might pay. Trump has floated a 15 percent cap on pass-through income, which would cut taxes for some S-corporations massively. But this plan has been heavily criticized, with opponents saying it would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and encourage people to reconfigure their businesses to avoid paying taxes.", "keywords": ["highest", "world", "rate", "fact", "rates", "scorporations", "corporate", "check", "statutory", "does", "income", "businesses", "taxes", "tax"], "polarity": 0.1275830527497194, "subjectivity": 0.4094323392656725},

But on Tuesday, it could be the first to approve it at the ballot box.\n\nQuestion 2 asks Maine voters if they want to provide roughly 70,000 Mainers with health care coverage by expanding eligibility of Medicaid, known as MaineCare. It provides health coverage for people living at or near the poverty line.\n\nThe national battle over Medicaid expansion began with a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision that conservatives originally hoped would hobble the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature legislative achievement.\n\nBut instead of repealing the law's individual mandate requiring that most Americans obtain health insurance, the court upheld it. The court then struck down a provision requiring all states to expand eligibility of Medicaid.\n\nThat surprise 2012 court ruling shifted the political battle. While the GOP-led House of Representatives would go on to take over 50 symbolic ACA repeal votes, progressive and conservative activists descended on state legislatures to fight over Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe intensity of those battles illustrated the importance of Medicaid expansion as a component of the ACA. The program not only lowered the number of people without health insurance, it also has arguably made repealing the health care law harder.\n\nMedicaid funding cuts included in Senate bills to repeal ACA were the primary reason that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, broke ranks with most of the GOP to oppose the bills.\n\n\"First, both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the Medicaid program. Expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036,\" she said in September. \"This would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors.\"\n\nCollins has also cited the impact on Maine's rural hospitals, which are heavily dependent on Medicaid reimbursement payments.\n\nEffects On The Uninsured\n\nArchitects of the federal health care law sought to lower the number of people without health insurance by requiring most Americans to have coverage. The law also lets states expand access to Medicaid, a federal program run by the states and funded with a mix of state and federal money.\n\nIn 2013, Maine's legislature voted to expand the state's program, and Republican Gov. Paul LePage vetoed the bill. It was the first of a half dozen vetoes.\n\nAbout 9 percent of Maine residents lacked insurance in 2016, comparable to 8.6 percent in the 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid. That could be because the state had expanded its program in 2002 and 2003.\n\nThe number of people enrolled in Medicaid has been dropping, as the LePage administration moved aggressively to restrict eligibility\n\nIn 2012, there were 345,000 Mainers receiving Medicaid. There were 268,000 through June of this year, according the Department of Health and Human Services. The state spends $2.6 billion on the program, with two-thirds of that coming from the feds.\n\nMeanwhile, roughly 70,000 Mainers have fallen into what's known as the ACA coverage gap. The gap occurs in the 19 states that did not expand Medicaid.\n\nThe ACA originally conceived Medicaid expansion as a bridge between low-income adults already eligible for Medicaid coverage and those who could qualify for subsidies to purchase their own individual plans.\n\nBut without expansion, thousands of Mainers neither qualify for subsidies nor Medicaid.\n\nMost of the 70,000 people who would gain coverage if Question 2 passes earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 a year for an individual and $34,000 for a family of four.\n\nFor And Against\n\nConservative and progressive activists have engaged in a long, pitched fight over Medicaid expansion. The arguments for and against expansion haven't changed much, and neither have the methods of persuasion.\n\nConservatives repeatedly note that Maine was an early expander of Medicaid in 2002-2003. They claim that the state's uninsured rate was unaffected by increasing eligibility and that the program became a budget buster, creating deficits when state revenues declined during the economic downturn.\n\nProgressives counter that early expansion helped keep Maine's uninsured rate steady while other states saw a surge. Additionally, they argue that the higher federal reimbursement rate offered through the ACA protects the state.\n\nIf expansion passes, the federal government will initially cover 94 percent of the cost. That ratchets down to 90 percent by 2020 and stays at that level, as long as Congress doesn't cut reimbursements.\n\nBut Brent Littlefield with the anti-expansion Welfare to Work PAC says there's still a cost to Maine taxpayers.\n\n\"The current plan would have state taxpayers paying between $50 million to $100 million per year,\" he says.\n\nThe expansion debate has been marked by its heated rhetoric. Opponents have repeatedly called would-be recipients \"able bodied,\" while calling the proposal \"welfare expansion\" \u2014 descriptions designed to tap sharply divided public perceptions of people receiving public assistance.\n\nProponents, meanwhile, have been stressing the human impact, focusing on personal stories of those who would benefit from the program.\n\nHigh Stakes\n\nWelfare ToWork YouTube\n\nQuestion 2 has been billed by some as a final resolution, but it could also be a litmus test for public sentiment about the Affordable Care Act. GOP repeal efforts have not polled well. While the ACA has not been a centerpiece of the proponents' arguments for expansion, an affirmative expansion vote on Nov. 7 could be spun as a tacit public endorsement for the health care law, because Medicaid is such a key component.\n\nLocally, the political stakes are high. LePage has been a leading critic of expansion, and he's taking an active role in opposing Question 2. Defeating Question 2 could validate the governor's stance. Conversely, an affirmative vote could deal a blow to the governor's full-court press against the law.\n\nBut a victory for supporters of Question 2 could be fleeting. The state legislature changed, delayed or attempted to repeal all four of the ballot initiatives that voters approved last year.\n\nSteve Mistler is chief political correspondent for Maine Public Radio.", "keywords": ["access", "expansion", "medicaid", "health", "states", "program", "state", "care", "aca", "maine", "decide", "voters", "public"], "polarity": 0.0886111111111111, "subjectivity": 0.39570261437908494},

But the Census Bureau says the 2020 census won't include it.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAnd now to the U.S. Census coming up in 2020. There were plans to add a new category to the forms for people of Middle Eastern or North African descent. But the U.S. Census Bureau has decided against it. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports on the reaction.\n\nHANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Naseem Alkobadi left Yemen as a young girl with her family 15 years ago. And after they settled in New York City, she noticed that when you fill out an official form here in the U.S., there always seemed to be a question about race and ethnicity.\n\nNASEEM ALKOBADI: Everywhere - you can see it when you go to a doctor or schools. You always get this option.\n\nWANG: And Alkobadi says she wasn't sure which check box is for her.\n\nALKOBADI: Honestly, it was hard for me to pick. I was like, oh, my God. What should I put? Should I put Asian or...\n\nWANG: Other? Alkobadi says because Yemen is on the continent of Asia, she settled on Asian. And when she can on forms, she writes in Arab. But she says on the 2020 census, she would've liked to mark a box for Middle Eastern or North African.\n\nALKOBADI: It should be there because they had many nationalities. So why is it not there? It's unbelievable.\n\nWANG: Mohammad Barakat is disappointed by the Census Bureau's decision, too. He works at the Arab American Family Support Center based in Brooklyn and remembers grappling with the race question as a first-grader.\n\nMOHAMMAD BARAKAT: My parents came here from Palestine. They didn't really know English. And so whenever there was paperwork, I had to do it.\n\nWANG: And on one of those forms...\n\nBARAKAT: I remember seeing white, and then in parentheses, anyone from the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nWANG: Which are the regions, along with Europe, that the U.S. government defines as white. But Barakat got was perplexed. He went to school and asked his teacher if he could answer Asian.\n\nBARAKAT: And she's like, well, if you want to put Asian, go ahead. But I think you should put white. And so I went around, asking other teachers. And they all said you're white. You're white. I'm like, but look at me.\n\nWANG: Barakat says he doesn't look white, and he's culturally not white. But, sometimes, he marks white if he sees the Middle East and North Africa listed next to it. Or he looks for a box for other, so he can write in Arab. This makeshift way of answering surveys means that information about people with roots in the Middle East or North Africa is often hidden within data about other groups.\n\nMAYA BERRY: The fight right now is to say the category should be there because it will arrive at a better count.\n\nWANG: Maya Berry is the executive director of the Arab American Institute, which is trying to get support in Congress to overturn the Census Bureau's decision. But she admits the timing of this push is not ideal. Following President Trump's travel bans against countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen, many in the Middle Eastern and North African communities in the U.S. worry about giving the federal government more personal information.\n\nBERRY: That's the burden that our communities had to bear - trying to make a determination about - do you advocate for the inclusion of a category or not?\n\nWANG: Berry says getting a Middle Eastern or North African check box onto the census is one fight.

Luther Strange, R-Ala., at a campaign rally Friday night, when he used a segue in his speech that was supposed to convince voters that continuing to have Strange in the Senate would make all Alabamans winners \u2014 an argument with emotional appeal in a state known for its fierce love of football.\n\nCNN via YouTube\n\nAnd while he was on the subject of football, Trump took the opportunity to expound on his thoughts regarding NFL players, like Colin Kaepernick, who last year began kneeling during the national anthem in protest over perceived social injustices against African-Americans. Trump's take: It's unpatriotic and NFL team owners should fire those refusing to stand.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now'?\" he said to roaring applause.\n\n\"He's fired!\" Trump said, paraphrasing his popular reality TV catchphrase.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took on Stephen Curry of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors in a tweet. The president rescinded an offer for what has become a traditional celebratory visit to the White House for any championship team of a major professional sport.\n\nHe wrote: \"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nThe president was reacting to Curry's statement Friday that the popular star player didn't want to visit the White House and meet with Trump because Curry believed that passing on the traditional event would send the message that \"we won't stand for\" some of Trump's past remarks. \"This is my opportunity to voice that,\" Curry also said, of the possibility of not going to the White House as expected.\n\nSaturday afternoon, Trump was back online attacking the NFL.\n\n\"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile none of Trump's tweets or remarks were explicitly about race, they led to an escalating war of words between the president and black athletes, activists and celebrities on social media. And the president, who was almost immediately cast as being divisive, took a serious pummeling from NFL team owners and notable black public figures.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Saturday morning, \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players.\"\n\nLate Friday night, before Trump had sparked controversy involving Curry, Max Garcia of the Denver Broncos couldn't help comparing Trump's comments about kneeling in the NFL during the campaign rally with how he responded to events in Charlottesville, Va., last month that left one counterprotester dead.\n\n\"What an emphatic response, where was this passion in response to Charlottesville...\" Garcia wrote on Twitter with a video of Trump.\n\nIndividual NFL teams, including the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers all issued statements Saturday condemning Trump's remarks.\n\nJed York, CEO of the San Francisco 49ers, for whom Kaepernick played last year when he began the kneeling protest, issued this statement:\n\n\"The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for. Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice.\"\n\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross said, \"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness. We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites.\"\n\nMeanwhile, current and former luminaries in the NBA weighed in online Saturday expressing support for Curry and criticizing Trump.\n\nBasketball megastar LeBron James, who has nearly as many followers on Twitter (38.4 million) as Trump does on his personal account (39 million), defended Curry, his sometimes rival on the court.\n\nJames wrote, \"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, James' tweet has been liked more than a 1.1 million times and retweeted more than a half million times. According to Twitter, the message is James' most retweeted post to date.\n\nJames later recorded and posted a two-minute video to Twitter in which he said, \"It's not about dividing. We as American people need to come together even stronger.\"\n\nChris Paul, who plays for the Houston Rockets and is president of the NBA Players Association, questioned the president's attention to the issue in the first place. \"With everything that's going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who's kneeling and visiting the White House??? #StayInYoLane,\" Paul wrote on Twitter.\n\nRetired longtime Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant contributed this to the online conversation, suggesting Trump was not living up to his ubiquitous campaign slogan: \"A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly 'Make America Great Again.' \"\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the Warriors formally announced they were not visiting the White House \u2014 or Trump. \"We accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited,\" the team said in a statement.\n\n\"In lieu of a visit to the White House,\" the NBA champions added, \"we have decided that we'll constructively use our trip to the nation's capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion \u2014 the values we embrace as an organization.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/AP\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was \"disappointed\" the team would not be visiting the White House. Curry, for his part, suggested Trump's effort to target him was beneath the dignity of the presidency.\n\nThe dual controversies also elicited reaction Saturday from black celebrities including musician John Legend, actor Jesse Williams and filmmaker Ava DuVernay, among others.\n\nSome politicians also joined the fray on Twitter.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took a jab at Trump for comments he has made in the past ridiculing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being of prisoner of war. \"And if a person wants the privilege of serving as President, they shouldn't be allowed to disrespect military heroes who were taken prisoner,\" Schiff tweeted.\n\nCalifornia's lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, congratulated the Warriors for the stance. \"Couldn't be more proud of the @warriors. Thank you for speaking truth to power and standing up for our fundamental California values,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the country's growing divisiveness, suggested that if the kneeling protest spread, NFL players would be playing into Trump's hands: \"btw, Trump wants you to kneel\u2014because it divides the nation, with him and the flag on the same side. Don't give him the attention he wants,\" Sasse tweeted.\n\nSeemingly answering Sasse, Trump backers argued that the president's comments have nothing to do with race and are purely about patriotism and respect for the flag.\n\n\"Has our world turned upside down! Our President criticized for believing our flag & anthem should be respected & honored #StandForTheFlag,\" Ronna Romney, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski expressed similar sentiments on Fox News Saturday.\n\nSome in the Washington press corps wrote Saturday that the president is deliberately using coded language to appeal to his base of white voters who see themselves as part of an aggrieved group in America, rapidly losing power and influence relative to ethnic and racial minorities.\n\n\"To address a largely white crowd as 'people like yourselves,' and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as 'those people,' does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville,\" political journalist Mike Allen wrote on Axios.com Saturday morning.\n\nRon Brownstein, another seasoned political journalist in D.C., spent most of the day on Twitter putting forth the argument that exploiting racial and economic anxieties and divisions was one of Trump's key political strategies.\n\n\"Point of this fight is not very hard to find- more signaling to white racial resentment, which has been central to Trump message from day 1,\" Brownstein tweeted.\n\nBrownstein reaffirmed his point in a later tweet when another journalist questioned whether Trump was utilizing any strategy at all. \"Yes, pretty clearly from day 1: to appeal to parts of older, blue-collar, non-urban white America most uneasy about demographic & eco change,\" Brownstein wrote.\n\nAnother journalist was more blunt. \"There is an unmistakable racial element at play, since he is targeting prominent black players,\" CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote Saturday afternoon about Trump's NFL comments.\n\nAnd Stelter's CNN colleague Chris Cillizza saw something similar, writing Saturday that the context of Trump's criticisms was inherently racial given that both the NBA and NFL have mostly white team owners and mostly black players. Cillizza went on to point out that Trump's comments Friday and Saturday bore two rhetorical hallmarks that went back to his presidential campaign: using racially coded language and espousing a seemingly simplistic view of the black community.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout most of Saturday, the hashtag #TakeAKnee trended on Twitter across the U.S., as people sympathetic to Kaepernick wondered about what NFL players would do Sunday and as they talked about posting photos of themselves kneeling in solidarity.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Kaepernick-style protest spread to professional baseball.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Eric Risberg/AP\n\nCatcher Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A's took a knee during the national anthem before a game Saturday night in California.

The plan prioritizes highly skilled workers over family members for green cards.\n\nThe administration reasons that too many low-skilled immigrant workers are entering the country, costing Americans jobs and wages.\n\nMiller said the U.S. has, in recent years, issued green cards without regard to whether an immigrant can \"pay their own way or be reliant on welfare, or whether they'll displace or take a job from an American worker.\"\n\nCalling a green card the \"golden ticket\" of immigration, Miller said Trump's proposal \"puts the needs of the working class ahead of the investor class.\"\n\n\"We're protecting blue-collar workers,\" he said.\n\nThe claim:\n\n\"We've seen significant reductions in wages for blue-collar workers, massive displacement of African-American and Hispanic workers, as well as the displacement of immigrant workers from previous years who oftentimes compete directly against new arrivals who are being paid even less,\" Stephen Miller said.\n\nMiller went on to say the \"numbers of low-skilled [immigrant] workers in particular is a major detriment to U.S. workers.\"\n\nThe question:\n\nHave immigrants taken jobs from and lowered wages for American blue-collar workers?\n\nThe short answer:\n\nEconomists disagree whether or how much an influx of immigrants depresses wages. Some have found that new immigrants depress wages for certain groups, such as teenagers or workers with a high school diploma or less. Others say the overall effect on the economy is tiny, and an influx of immigrant workers vitalizes the economy overall.\n\nEither way, the forces driving wage reductions for blue-collar workers go far beyond immigration.\n\nThe long answer:\n\nIt is true that wages for low-wage workers have declined \u2014 they fell 5 percent from 1979 to 2013. That may not seem like a huge drop, but during that same period, the hourly wages of high-wage workers rose 41 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nHowever, economists disagree over whether an influx of immigrant labor caused or contributed to declining blue-collar jobs and wages.\n\nAsked to provide a study that supported the administration's assertion, Stephen Miller cited work from George Borjas, a Harvard labor economist, on how the Mariel boatlift affected blue-collar wages in Miami. In 1980, 125,000 Cuban immigrants came to the U.S., mostly Miami, from the town of Mariel.\n\nBorjas, Miller said, \"went back and re-examined and opened up the old data, and talked about how it actually did reduce wages for workers who were living there at the time.\"\n\nBorjas' new analysis found that the wages of high school dropouts in Miami dropped between 10-30 percent after the refugee influx (the analysis looked at 1977 to 1993).\n\nBut an earlier study on the boatlift, from 1990 by Princeton economist David Card, looked at wages of \"less-skilled\" workers overall (as opposed to just high school dropouts) and found \"virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier.\"\n\nThe debate remains unsettled, and it's impossible to extrapolate the effect of the boatlift on Miami to the whole country.\n\nA recent analysis commissioned and published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found \"the literature on employment impacts finds little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers.\"\n\nOverall, the analysis called the inflow of foreign-born people \"a relatively minor factor in the $18 trillion U.S. economy.\" However, the analysis does cite recent research that immigration could reduce the number of hours worked by teenagers and some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.\n\nThere are, of course, other forces that have depressed blue-collar wages: increased automation, globalization, declining unionization and government policies on overtime. The Trump administration recently said it would not defend an Obama-era rule that made workers who make less than $47,000 per year (up from about $24,000) eligible for overtime.\n\nNot just about economics\n\nThe politics of the bill reach beyond economics. At Wednesday's briefing, Miller was also asked to defend the fact that the bill prioritizes English-speaking immigrants. Miller, along with adviser Steve Bannon, have led an ethnonationalist wing at the White House. Bannon has complained about the number of Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley, implying that they are adversarial to America's \"civic society.\"\n\n\"Are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?\" CNN's Jim Acosta asked.\n\n\"The notion that you think this is a racist bill is so wrong and so insulting,\" Miller answered, adding that the country's foreign-born population into the U.S. \"has quadrupled since 1970.\"\n\nWhile Miller is correct that the foreign-born population has increased, in 1970 the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S. was the lowest in a century. The share of the population that's foreign born today is about the same as the late 1800s and early 1900s, according to the U.S. Census.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt is important to note that Trump's plan would have a steep uphill battle to get through this Congress. Still, not surprisingly, there is also debate around how Trump's drastic proposal will affect blue-collar wages moving forward. The Trump administration hopes the plan will free up future jobs for American low-wage workers. But Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, who has advised John McCain and donated to McCain and Hillary Clinton's campaigns, told Politico the plan is a \"mistake\" that will cause the labor force to come to a \"standstill\" in the next decade. \"It is hard to imagine a policy that would do more damage to long-term economic growth,\" he said.\n\nAs NPR's Brian Naylor noted, economists believe the country's low unemployment rate (4.4 percent) coupled with retiring baby boomers will result in a labor shortage in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, an open letter signed by 1,470 economists argued that \"the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh their costs, and smart immigration policy could better maximize the benefits of immigration while reducing the costs.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Trump praised highly skilled workers, which his plan now prioritizes \u2014 but studies are also mixed on whether those workers positively impact wages or also depress the wages of American-born workers.\n\nScott Horsley and Shaheen Ainpour contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["workers", "analysis", "immigrant", "fact", "plan", "lowered", "bluecollar", "check", "miller", "american", "wages", "immigration", "trumps", "immigrants"], "polarity": 0.05794889892715983, "subjectivity": 0.3878397327310371},

It's currently the only Republican-held legislative chamber on the West Coast.\n\nIf the Democratic candidate Manka Dhingra wins, Washington state's government would be fully controlled by Democrats. Democrats currently control the governorships and state legislature in six states, compared to 26 held by Republicans. The race is also another test of Democratic grass-roots enthusiasm during the Trump presidency. In 2017, Democrats have flipped eight state legislative seats from Republican control in special elections like this one.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/AP\n\nWith full control of Washington state, Democrats argue the West Coast states could take an ever more aggressive lead in opposing Trump administration policies, especially around regional efforts to tackle climate change. That's one reason this special election has drawn so much money and attention from out-of-state interests.\n\nDemocrats are doing their best to link Republican candidate Jinyoung Lee Englund to President Trump. The district is filled with prosperous, well-educated voters and includes parts of Redmond where Microsoft is headquartered. Hillary Clinton carried the district in 2016.\n\nEnglund describes herself as an entrepreneur and vows to oppose new state taxes. She once worked for the state's influential Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are casting Dhingra, who's a prosecutor supervising special courts for veterans and the mentally ill, as a sinister ally of Seattle's beyond-progressive politics. In one attack ad, actors impersonating liberal Seattle \"types\" (including a cyclist who exclaims \"F*** the cars!\") express glowing support of the Democrat and sneer at suburban \"soccer moms.\"\n\nDuring a debate sponsored by the local Fox affiliate last month, Englund argued that keeping the seat in Republican hands was the only thing preventing a carbon tax and a state capital gains tax. \"When I go door to door, the issues that people talk to me about are feeling overburdened by taxes.\"\n\nBut Democrats say the Republican-controlled Senate has blocked popular legislation on climate change, voting rights and gun regulations.\n\nDhingra noted in the debate that in 2016, Washington voters overwhelmingly passed an initiative to allow families to seek removal of guns from people in crisis.\n\n\"Because our legislators are unable to act. And what we have the opportunity to do \u2014 it's only one vote \u2014 is change the fact that we're not governing,\" Dhingra said.\n\nAt least $6 million has poured into the race, with billionaire donors like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and climate activist Tom Steyer making six-figure donations to Dhingra and her allies.\n\nRepublican donors from around the country are also going all-out. The Washington, D.C.-based Republican State Leadership Council, whose top contributor is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has given $450,000 to a PAC run by the Washington Senate Republican Caucus. The oil company Phillips 66 has donated $350,000 to a PAC that supports Englund.\n\nOne big issue in the race has been the county's initiative to open \"supervised drug consumption sites,\" where people can consume heroin and other drugs under medical supervision. A task force of experts proposed the sites as one step in dealing with the opioid crisis.\n\nEnglund calls for a statewide ban on the sites. Several suburban cities have enacted their own bans. Dhingra would allow the consumption sites if communities are willing to host them.

Really, who knew they cared so much?\n\nThe qualifiers for the president's claims around black joblessness are pretty significant; indeed, they're actually the whole story. Most of the improvement in the jobs figures are part of an ongoing trend that can be attributed to the Fed's management of the economy under Janet Yellen, whom President Trump declined to renominate to run the nation's central bank. And while the black employment numbers were historically low, at the time of Trump's speech, the most recent jobs data put black unemployment at 6.8 percent. If those numbers were the overall national figures, the country would be in or near a recession. Consider that for as far back as the data goes, black unemployment has consistently been around twice the rate of joblessness for white people, in strong economies or sluggish ones. If the broader economy is on solid footing, black unemployment numbers is high. When the nation is a downturn, black employment figures teeter on the catastrophic.\n\nEven the relatively low black unemployment numbers that Trump touted in his State of the Union speech couldn't hold; by the end of the week, new jobs figures showed that black unemployment actually spiked nearly a full point to 7.7 percent. And if black unemployment is never that low, white unemployment is almost never that high, with a notable recent exception of a sustained fallow period between 2009 and 2011 during the Great Recession. (In January, white unemployment fell to 3.3 percent.) Taken together, the January numbers are another example of the precarity of the black economic condition and the extent to which racial disparities in joblessness have calcified into a permanent, structural feature of American life.\n\n\"[Politicians] using improvement in the numbers to ignore the disparities, but there's almost no celebration to be had,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Privacy program at the Brookings Institute. He said that black people were \"the sacrificial lambs for full employment,\" as a desire for aggressive interventions to lower joblessness tends to dry up when the economy is doing better, even as black people are still struggling. And it means that the kinds of policy decisions that get made when the economy is robust \u2014 say, raising interest rates \u2014 might be good for banks but make it even harder for black borrowers with less family wealth and lower incomes to get loans for homes and businesses. \"[Lawmakers] have not demonstrated the stomach to really invest in ways to create inclusive economies,\" Perry said. \"It's still federal investment, but in a gated community kind of way.\"\n\nAnd yes, a major part of understanding the employment gap means understanding discrimination, which as we've written before, is a knowable, quantifiable component of the labor market. Even when you control for education, black folks are less likely to be employed and have lower starting salaries than similarly situated white people. When the economy is more robust, that racial gap in employment does shrink, because there's more competition among employers for workers; which is to say that it becomes more costly for employers to discriminate than when jobs are more scarce. But that gap in employment remains, and the gains we do see in black employment tend to be clustered in lower-paying sectors like retail or the gig economy.\n\nThere are rural, white communities where unemployment numbers looks like black unemployment numbers, but their employment prospects, too, tend to also be obscured by federal jobs numbers. Conversely, there are communities across the country where black employment and wages actually outpace national averages \u2014 they tend to be places that have large, black middle classes due to their proximity to federal jobs, universities, military bases, and the steady private investment that flows around those institutions. Perry said those regions could serve as a template for how to reduce the racial jobs gap \u2014 lawmakers in Washington could direct funding and investment to bolster those anchor institutions, while investing in the kind of infrastructure jobs that create jobs and transferable job skills for communities where people are consistently out of work for long stretches of time.\n\nWhich brings us back to President Trump. He's never never really explained which specific policies he's championed or enacted that would have lowered the low (but still really high) black unemployment rate for which he's claimed credit. And of course, that's not really the point of him invoking any of this: his boast and Republicans' rapturous applause to it was a way to ding the Democrats (and Trump's black predecessor) for their supposed inaction toward alleviating the plight of black people.

Because the issues that we were facing could not be ignored.\"\n\nFor our podcast episode this week, we spoke with Amber Senter and Andrea Unsworth about Supernova Women and about the challenges they've faced in an industry run predominantly by white people. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are the barriers of entry for people of color trying to operate a successful weed business?\n\n\n\nSenter: Our skin color, obviously, because people don't have to give us anything because of that. I mean, not only am I black, but I'm also a woman. Two levels of barriers there. Convincing someone to give you $250,000 so you can start a business, that's challenging in itself. Even with all the experience that might be bringing to the table, you're still going to get doubted.\n\nWhereas if I were a white man, coming up with some corny idea \u2014 people are just throwing money at them. You know? And then there's other people who have proven product, made a million dollars in sales on their own, and are having problems raising $100,000, because they're people of color, women of color in the industry. We deal with the same barriers that would exist in any industry, and then it's compounded because we're talking about a federally illegal substance.\n\nYou say it can be really hard, as a manufacturer, to go into a dispensary and talk to the buyer, because the buyer is a often a white guy. Can you break down that dynamic?\n\nSenter: First of all, when you're walking up to the dispensary, the people of color that are working in the dispensary are either going to be the security crew or the bud tenders, but none of the management. No one that's making any decisions. But that's how the whole industry currently is. Me, as a manufacturer looking for investment \u2014 there's no people of color investors. I mean they're out there, but they're hard to find.\n\nUnsworth: At the end of the day, we've been locking up people of color for 30 years, who have been selling cannabis. Now that it's legal, they say, \"Great, it's legal, but you have to have a million dollars to start.\"\n\nWell, how can you have a million dollars if, for the past 30 years, you and all your relatives have been getting locked up and trying to spend that money on bail money? And raising your family without a father, without an uncle, without a son? Those are the realities.\n\nThis whole thing of starting on a level playing field is ridiculous. [Nearly] 80 percent of the lock-ups are people of color. You're locking up all of these people who are trying to be entrepreneurs, but now that it's legal, you're allowed to say, \"Oh, you can come into our industry, but you can't have a criminal record. You can have a million dollars, but it can't be from cannabis, it has to be from your 401(k), or investments, or from your daddy.\"\n\nI mean, who are these people? These are not people of color.\n\nOn the site for Supernova Women, it says you want to foster a space for hard conversations. What type of hard conversations are y'all having?\n\nSenter: I'm a manufacturer. We make cannabis products that we turn around and sell to dispensaries. And often times going into the dispensary, I have to deal with people that do not look like me. Typically white males. And I've got to convince them to first hear me out, and then try my product and then, if they think the product is good enough, to get it on their shelves.\n\nWith the cultural differences and everything, these things are a fine dance, and a lot of people feel uncomfortable when you bring up these kinds of situations and things that we deal with. And I'm saying a lot of people \u2014 it's white folks. You know, they don't want to hear these things. So we create a safe space where we can discuss these issues and real-life things that we deal with daily.\n\nUnsworth: And I would say that those are the type of conversations that prompted things like the Oakland Equity Program, because that was not even on the table when we were first talking about cannabis.\n\nAt least we need to recognize that there has been an unfair \u2014 an unjust war \u2014 on people of color that has had an impact over the past 20 to 30 years, that has kept them out of the cannabis industry that is now burgeoning. And so if we're going to have folks coming into the cannabis industry, we have to at least acknowledge that there has been demonstrable damage done to a lot of these communities that would love to be entrepreneurs that should have been some of the first in line.\n\nBecause they've had innovative products and they've had the network, and they've had the skill to distribute cannabis for years, but were maybe locked up or put behind bars or just, you know, didn't have enough.", "keywords": ["industry", "black", "things", "legally", "color", "white", "weed", "women", "selling", "theyve", "cannabis", "supernova", "youre"], "polarity": 0.05500380517503807, "subjectivity": 0.4687404870624048},

How?\n\nThe glimpse I've gotten into the White House through Bannon, through all the other White House officials and campaign officials that I interviewed for this book [is] that on a day-to-day basis what's really going on there is a kind of Darwinian fight for survival. Everybody in there is busy either stabbing other people in the back or trying to protect their own back.\n\nOne of the themes I touch on in the new preface is why it is that this whole populist/nationalist project failed \u2014 the one that got Trump elected \u2014 once he got to the White House. And I think the answer is that Bannon ultimately decided to spend his time pursuing his internal enemies and nursing his own grievances. And that is the way that a lot of other senior people in the White House have behaved and continue to behave.\n\nOn Bannon's public persona and unkempt appearance\n\nHe cultivated this image of himself as a kind of behind-the-scenes Machiavelli, because I think he was shrewd enough to know that if you're out in front of the cable news cameras, Trump is eventually going to turn on you. ...\n\n'Saturday Night Live' had just done their little skit where the Bannon character is Death who comes out as the Grim Reaper \u2014 and Bannon just thought it was the greatest thing in the world, thought it was hilarious.\n\nBannon was delighted with his portrayal in the popular culture. I remember him calling me up one Sunday morning \u2014 this would be probably back in the spring or the summer when Saturday Night Live had just done their little skit where the Bannon character is Death who comes out as the Grim Reaper \u2014 and Bannon just thought it was the greatest thing in the world, thought it was hilarious.\n\nSo all of this, I think, is a very carefully crafted image that is meant to distinguish him as someone different than kind of the lickspittle sycophants who are often representing Trump on cable news, people like Corey Lewandowski who kind of go on and shower Trump with obsequious praise. I think Bannon has much more of an ego than that, views himself as not just a serious figure but as a historical figure who was the brains behind the ideas that got Trump elected.\n\nOn Bannon leaking to the press\n\nBannon was notorious for leaking to the press. He was on the phone with reporters all day every day in the transition and in the White House. The idea that Bannon is hostile to the press \u2014 he famously dubbed us \"the opposition party\" \u2014 is a complete fiction and meant to cultivate this idea that Trump and the people around him were constantly and unfairly under assault by reporters.\n\nBannon loves talking to reporters. He loves trying to shape the narrative, and ultimately, I think his sloppiness in talking to reporters and authors is what cost him his job. But he would use the press not only to kind of shape the daily news, but to go after his enemies and try to plant a dagger in the back of whoever it was that he was upset with these days.\n\nEverybody in the White House knows this. Everybody in the press knows this. And I think Trump knew it too, which is why he ended up leaving as early in the Trump administration has he did.\n\nOn the falling out between Trump and Bannon\n\nWhat Bannon wanted to do when he left the White House was essentially to move the nationalist movement, as he thought of it, beyond just Donald Trump. The real cause of their falling-out \u2014 Trump's and Bannon's \u2014 was Bannon thought that presidential election was a referendum on a set of ideas, this kind of vision of right-wing populism, and Trump thought it was a referendum on Trump.\n\nAnd Bannon knew when he left the White House that he needed to advance this movement beyond Trump, who wasn't really committed to it anyway, as we've subsequently seen. And so what he wanted to do was elect a set of Senate candidates who were essentially mini-Trumps who would oust Mitch McConnell, the establishment-friendly Senate majority leader, and give Bannon a base of support within the Congress to essentially change Washington and change the Republican party in a way that would make everybody Trumpist.\n\nOn Bannon's willingness to come back to the White House\n\nThere isn't an obvious outlet for him to be able to speak and say things, and I think that's one reason why he has let reporters like me and a few other folks back into his world \u2014 to essentially have a megaphone to spread this idea and to try to get back on Trump's radar as someone who is still in his corner and is still willing to fight for him if Trump wants to reach out and repair that relationship. One thing is clear is that Bannon is willing and eager to go back, despite all the ignominy heaped on him by the president.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

So, we at NPR decided to fact-check it and provide some of that context. Trump is still listening to Gingrich, so his comments may be indicative of what Trump believes about the Russia investigation.\n\nHere are nine fact checks and points of context from the interview:\n\n1. \"The Justice Department is an extraordinarily left-wing institution.\"\n\nThe DOJ's mission statement is as follows:\n\n\"To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\"\n\nThe department adds:\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson wrote, 'The most sacred of the duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.' This sacred duty remains the guiding principle for the women and men of the U.S. Department of Justice.\"\n\n2. \"Ninety-seven percent of [DOJ's] donations went to Hillary Clinton. ... In terms of Mueller's law firm, it was 99.82 percent went to Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nGingrich's evidence for calling DOJ \"an extraordinarily left-wing institution\" relied on political contributions. It's a constant complaint among conservatives that government workers are liberal. And if you go strictly based on political contributions, they have a point.\n\nOn the 97 percent figure, that's true, according to an analysis by The Hill from October.\n\nThe 99.82 percent figure isn't quite right, but the actual number is still large \u2014 anywhere from 75 percent to 89 percent depending on how you calculate it.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics's database shows that employees at WilmerHale, Mueller's former law firm, gave $582,571 to congressional Democratic candidates and $186,726 to Republicans. That's 75 percent of donations to Democrats.\n\nOverall, WilmerHale employees gave $1,130,577 to Democrats and $306,217 to Republicans. That's 77 percent to Democrats\n\nFor just the presidential race, here is how the donations broke down:\n\n\u2014Hillary Clinton (D) $326,798\n\n\u2014Jeb Bush (R) $32,813\n\n\u2014Scott Walker (R) $5,400\n\n\u2014John Kasich (R) $2,350\n\nSo for the presidential race, that is 89 percent of donations to the Democrat.\n\nBut these numbers are not the whole picture. A few things to also consider:\n\n(1) Most people think about their pockets first, and Republicans are more likely to cut government and freeze pay than Democrats. \"Government employees are, on balance, more moderate or more liberal as opposed to the general population. Not across the board, but in general,\" Hamline University professor David Schultz told The Hill in October. He added that they are \"more likely to believe in government as opposed to, let's say, a privatization program.\"\n\n(2) There is no record of Mueller having made a political donation.\n\n(3) As of at least 2001, Mueller was a registered Republican. (Fired FBI Director James Comey also was a registered Republican for most of his life until recently.)\n\n(4) WilmerHale has represented former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort; Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\n3. Who is the author of the book Gingrich kept referring to?\n\nThe former speaker repeatedly referenced a book called Licensed to Lie by Sidney Powell. The book has been widely cited among conservative outlets. Powell served as an assistant U.S. attorney from the late 1970s to late 1980s in the Western and Northern districts of Texas and in a very short stint in Virginia. She has since written for conservative outlets, such as Fox, Breitbart and Newsmax. And she has also written for the New York Observer, which was once owned by Kushner.\n\n4. \"I think that [President Trump is] deeply troubled by the entire way that both Comey and Mueller have operated.\"\n\nComey and Mueller have received bipartisan praise at varying times. That includes from Trump and Gingrich.\n\nDemocrats were irked by the way Comey handled the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Trump once said it \"took a lot of guts\" for Comey to announce that he would reopen that investigation shortly before the presidential election. But Trump later cited Comey's mismanagement of the Clinton email investigation when he fired him in May.\n\nMueller has been mum on his investigation into Russian interference in the election and potential ties to the Trump campaign, but he built up a star team of investigators and attorneys. Those moves didn't sit well with Trump loyalists.\n\nGingrich back in May said: \"Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.\"\n\nBut a month later, after he saw whom Mueller was bringing on board, Gingrich changed his tune.\n\n5. \"In terms of people he's been hiring, these are paid killers.\"\n\nAs for that team, Gingrich is echoing a Trump phrase for people who are tough. Trump uses \"killers\" not literally, but figuratively for shrewd businesspeople he likes or lawyers or news networks he doesn't.\n\nDespite the lawyers' years of experience, the White House has made a concerted effort to muddy up the investigators, calling out what it sees as conflicts. That strategy has centered on political contributions.\n\nTrump has taken to Twitter to accuse Mueller of having \"conflicts\" based on political donations from some of those attorneys (in addition to his friendship with Comey). Other White House officials have done so as well.\n\nNPR's Carrie Johnson put all of it in context on NPR's Morning Edition earlier this month, speaking with Rachel Martin:\n\n\"Robert Mueller has hired a number of lawyers. It is true that some of them have donated to Democrats. At least one has donated to Republicans, too. But Rachel, an important point of context here \u2014 even key Republican figures on Capitol Hill, like Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have said he does not believe political donations pose a conflict of interest. And in any event, Justice Department policies prohibit lawyers from looking at the donation history when they make hiring decisions.\"\n\nOf course, Trump also has given lots of money to Democrats in the past. Up until 2011, he gave more to Democrats than Republicans. He has since made up for it to the GOP.\n\n6. Gingrich lamented, \"the degree to which the attorney general [Jeff Sessions] has not exercised any authority over\" the conduct of Comey and Mueller and that \"the whole point that Trump is making is that he stepped aside and therefore he's not the leader of the department.\"\n\nThere are a couple things here:\n\nFirst, when it comes to the attorney general not exercising his authority over the actions of Comey and Mueller, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation because of Justice Department rules. They state, as follows:\n\n\"No DOJ employee may participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution, or who would be directly affected by the outcome. Political relationship means a close identification with an elected official, candidate, political party or campaign organization arising from service as a principal advisor or official; personal relationship means a close and substantial connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce partiality.\"\n\nSessions was a key political campaign adviser to Trump, and some of his political team now works in the White House. Even Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor whose name has been bandied about as someone who could replace Sessions, has said he thinks it was appropriate that Sessions stepped aside.\n\nAlso, put Gingrich's statement in the context of what Anthony Scaramucci, Trump's new communications director, said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show Tuesday. He asserted that Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama, was a \"pretty good hockey goalie\" for the president.\n\nThe attorney general may serve at the pleasure of the president, but he is not supposed to protect him. The attorney general is expected to be one of, if not the most, independent of Cabinet officials. He should be able to do his job free from interference or influence from the White House.\n\nWhen pressed, Gingrich went on to say, \"It is the attorney general's job to enforce the law,\" but he continued to question the basis for Mueller's investigation.\n\nSecondly, Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation does not mean he is not the \"leader of the department.\" He recused himself from one investigation.\n\nPerhaps it's revealing that Trump, and surrogates like Gingrich, are treating Sessions' recusal as if he has stepped aside from his entire job. Conservative media outlets have been urging Trump to keep Sessions on, because he is simpatico with a lot of what they believe, especially when it comes to immigration. They understand that the scope of the job is beyond any single investigation.\n\n7. \"Mueller is engaged in a fishing expedition\"\n\nGingrich also claimed Mueller's investigation should never have been launched, because there is \"no evidence of a crime.\" In doing so, he cited \"Andy McCarthy,\" a former Justice Department prosecutor.\n\nWho is McCarthy? NPR's Scott Neuman reports: As assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Andrew McCarthy was indeed the lead prosecutor in the successful 1995 case against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 others in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n\nIn the pages of the conservative National Review, McCarthy has written on several occasions that he sees no evidence of a crime warranting the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nHow is a special counsel appointed and what reasons did DOJ give for appointing Mueller? NPR's Johnson points to the legal code for appointing a special counsel:\n\n\"The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and \u2014 \"(a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and \"(b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.\"\n\nRod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, used that authority to appoint Mueller on May 17. His reasoning was, in part, laid out this way:\n\n\"My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted. I have made no such determination. What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.\"\n\nAs for why the FBI and DOJ believe this investigation is important, it might best be summed up by Comey from his testimony back in March:\n\n\"I truly believe we are a shining city on a hill to quote a great American, and one of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair democratic system and the elections that undergird it. And so, when there's an effort by a foreign nation-state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it's very, very serious \u2014 threatens what is America. And if any Americans are part of that effort, it's a very serious matter. And so you would expect the FBI to want to understand \u2014 is that so? And, if so, who did what?\"\n\n8. \"The history of Comey's last independent counsel Patrick Fitzgerald who Comey got appointed after they knew there was no crime and after they knew who had leaked the CIA agent's name and they told the person who leaked to shut up and they then went after Scooter Libby who was Dick Cheney's chief of staff because they wanted to get Cheney and they then locked up a New York Times reporter for 85 days to get her to testify. And you looked at that record you would assume automatically Mueller is going to get somebody.\"\n\nYou can't be blamed if you didn't quite get all that. Don't worry, NPR's Neuman unpacks it: There's a lot here, but what Gingrich seems to be suggesting is that Mueller is likely to go on a fishing expedition because Comey hired overly zealous prosecutors in the past.\n\nAs evidence, he is pointing to the Valerie Plame case, which was prosecuted and overseen by Comey appointee Patrick Fitzgerald. Plame, you might recall, was the covert CIA officer looking into evidence of Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons-of-mass-destruction program in the run-up to the Iraq War. Her classified identity was blown by an anonymous senior administration official, who was revealed much later to be Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage.\n\nBut Armitage was never charged with a crime. Instead, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby was caught up in the scandal. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 30 months (later commuted by President George W. Bush) on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\nGingrich appears to be saying that Fitzgerald led an aggressive and meandering investigation and that Mueller will do the same, possibly sweeping up individuals who aren't necessarily the obvious focus of the Russia investigation.\n\nGingrich's logic here, as well as his conclusion, though, is more than a bit strained. FBI investigations can, and often do, lead in many directions and sweep up tangential criminal activity from the original focus.\n\n9. \"If you read Sidney Powell's book Licensed to Lie and you look at the Enron case and then you look at Weinstein, he's one of the first lawyers he hired. This is a guy who the Supreme Court by 9 to 0 said destroyed Arthur Andersen.\"\n\nGingrich misspoke here. He should have said Weissmann, not Weinstein. Neuman explains the background: Andrew Weissmann oversaw corporate fraud and foreign bribery investigations at the DOJ before being tapped by Mueller for the Russia probe.\n\nThe Supreme Court case that Gingrich refers to dates to 2005. It was a big federal obstruction of justice conviction won by the government in 2002 against accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP. Andersen employees shredded documents related to the collapse of Enron in 2001 ahead of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the energy firm.\n\nThe justices ruled that instructions to the jury didn't make clear that the government needed to prove that destruction of documents was a deliberate effort to undermine the SEC inquiry.\n\nMadeline Garcia and Abigail Censky contributed research to this report.", "keywords": ["critique", "comey", "newt", "trump", "fact", "scathing", "mueller", "gingrich", "political", "general", "check", "gingrichs", "department", "investigation", "trumps", "attorney", "justice"], "polarity": 0.07844662972280778, "subjectivity": 0.42311471105973714},

To the surprise of many who have only seen his name, Allan is white. And that's taken him on a lifelong odyssey of racial encounters.\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"My name is Jamaal ... I'm white.\"\n\nAllan grew up in southern Oregon, in a house on 18 acres with a commune on one side and a llama ranch on the other.\n\nThe origins of his name weren't that remarkable, Allan tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris.\n\n\"My parents decided they wanted less traditional names for their children. ... My dad was a Los Angeles Lakers fan and they had had a player named Jamaal Wilkes, and that name kind of came up,\" he says.\n\nHis mother \u2014 who was pregnant with Allan's sister at the time \u2014 fell in love with the sound of the name. Their parents named his sister Madera, and they named their son Jamaal \u2014 \"just to spice things up a bit, I guess,\" he says.\n\nAs Allan wrote for a blog called The Poetry Question:\n\n\"Growing up I never thought twice about my name (of course I was next door to a commune, hanging out with Orly, Oshia, Lark Song, River Rocks, Sky Blue, and more than one Rainbow). \"In a high school soccer game I was called 'a white man with a [horrific racial expletive deleted] name.' \"In January of 2002 I flew to London. I was randomly selected for additional passenger screening. It was me, Muhammad, Abdul, Tariq, and an old white haired lady named Jenny Smith. Seriously. I'm not sure what was faster, Jenny Smith's pat down or the dropping of the TSA agent's face when I responded to the name Jamaal.\"\n\nJamaal means \"beauty\" in Arabic.\n\n\"Learning the meaning behind it and, well, the beauty that comes in the sound of the name, I like that quite a bit,\" Allan says.\n\nIt's also a name that give him an unusual perspective on questions of identity, race and cultural stereotypes.\n\nWhen he goes out in Des Moines for drinks with friends who are black, the waitress or bartender often hands his debit card to someone else \u2014 someone black.\n\n\"They're making an assumption based on the name on the card and not paying attention to who handed it to them,\" Allan says. \"They say, 'Jamaal, oh that must be the black guy sitting here.' \"\n\n'We Could Use Some Diversity Here'\n\nThese kinds of assumptions also spill over into his professional life as a teacher.\n\n\"People usually don't bring it up on a first day, but after I've developed a rapport with the students and they feel comfortable having open conversations, they'll say, 'You know, when class started I thought you were going to be black,' \" Allan says.\n\nAnd he uses that as a jumping-off point for more questions: Why you would assume that and what did that mean? And were you disappointed? What were your thoughts when you actually saw me?\n\nThe question of someone's name, particularly if it has ethnic overtones, can have real consequence. One study found that after responding to 1,300 classified ads, applicants with black-sounding names were 50 percent less likely to get a callback than white-sounding names with comparable resumes.\n\nBut the opposite was at work in Allan's case. The principal who hired him told him he was lucky to get the job because they hadn't been planning to take another student teacher. Then Allan's application showed up.\n\n\"They scanned through it ... and they saw someone named Jamaal who played basketball, listed Muhammad Ali among his heroes and inspirations, and thought, 'We could use some diversity here, so let's bring this guy on, I think he'd be good for some of our younger minority male students,'\" he says. \"And, well, then I showed up.\"\n\nIf someone argued that the only reason Jamaal Allan got the job was affirmative action \u2014 well, the joke would be on them.\n\nThe school got diversity with Allan, but not necessarily the kind they thought. Not many people can say they grew up between a commune and a llama ranch.\n\n\"They said we need more diversity, we need someone who resonates well and connects with some of the young male students here,\" Allan says. \"It may not have been because of how I look, but through actions, that was exactly what they got.\"\n\nOn Allan's first day of work, he showed up at school and introduced himself to one of the secretaries.\n\n\"And she said, 'Oh, you're Jamaal, I expected you were going to be' \u2014 and there was a very long, very pregnant pause,\" Allan recalls. \"And the word she came up with was 'taller.' \"\n\n\"I just sort of chuckled and said, 'Yeah, I get reactions like that a lot.' \"", "keywords": ["card", "allan", "white", "school", "diversity", "thought", "race", "words", "allans", "jamaal", "im", "named"], "polarity": 0.07163033758104181, "subjectivity": 0.43819304717192037},

How?\n\nTo mark Black History Month, Penguin Classics is reprinting six early 20th century books by African-American writers. The five Harlem Renaissance novels, along with W.E.B Du Bois' 1903 masterwork, The Souls of Black Folk, are much more than a summons to reader-ly duty. Rather, they're a shake up and wake up call, reminding readers of the vigorous voices of earlier African-American writers, each of whom had their own ingenious take on \"the race problem\" and identity politics.\n\nWith a respectful nod, I'm going to bypass Du Bois' monumental essay collection, along with Harlem Renaissance superstars Claude McKay and Langston Hughes, in favor of three remaining revelatory novels by somewhat less celebrated writers.\n\nNella Larsen, the only female writer featured, makes the cut with her 1929 novel Passing. It's a page-turner premised on an idea that's discussed a lot these days: the idea of race as \"performance.\"\n\nLarsen's two main characters are upper-middle-class black women who knew each other back in the day and have been thrown together again by fate. Both women are light skinned, but one of them, Clare Kendry, has chosen to climb up the class ladder by passing as white.\n\nAt one point, Clare's clueless white husband says in conversation about black people: \"I don't dislike them, I hate them.\" Of course, the joke there is that he makes that boast while talking with two black women, one of whom is his wife.\n\nIn her sharp introduction to this edition of Passing, scholar Emily Bernard illuminates Larsen's own experience with the color line: Larsen was the daughter of a Danish mother and a West-Indian father. Passing is undeniably melodramatic, but it's infused with a sly humor and nervous awareness that Clare's daily act of \"performing whiteness\" will inevitably take a devastating toll.\n\nPassing is not an option for Wallace Thurman's heroine in The Blacker the Berry...: Emma Lou Morgan is so dark she thinks of herself as \"dipped, as it were, in indigo ink.\"\n\nThe Blacker the Berry... stirred up a hullabaloo when it came out in 1929 because it was the first novel to focus its plot on race prejudice or \"colorism\" among African-Americans.\n\nAlways hoping to find a more inclusive racial community, Emma Lou takes off to Los Angeles for college and then on to New York and Harlem. But everywhere she goes, lighter-skinned black women \u2014 the so-called \"blue veins\" \u2014 get exclusive access to the desirable sororities, jobs and potential husbands.\n\nThurman, whose literary career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis at 32, creates a complicated character in Emma Lou. By the time she arrives in Harlem, Emma Lou has realized her dark skin makes marriage unlikely, so she does something startling: She enjoys a series of sexual relationships without commitment or shame.\n\nApart from the vibrant character of Emma Lou, Thurman's novel presents some of the most layered portrayals of New York City life I've ever come across, from seedy employment agency waiting rooms to swank Harlem hot spots.\n\nThe dedication page of George S. Schuyler's extraordinary 1931 work of speculative fiction, Black No More, lets readers know that this is going to be a wild ride. Schuyler, who was black, writes:\n\nThis book is dedicated to all Caucasians in the great republic who can trace their ancestry back ten generations and confidently assert that there are no Black leaves, twigs, limbs, or branches on their family trees.\n\nBlack No More is a satiric tour de force that rips into myths of white supremacy, black nationalism and the American Dream. The story follows a black man named Max Disher as he gambles on a new invention, the Black-Off machine, that turns black folks white. Here's a jubilant Max after the procedure:\n\nGone were the slightly full lips and Ethiopian nose. Gone was the nappy hair. ... He was free!

The anthropologist, who has spent four decades teaching at Princeton University, was introducing a class called Cultural Freedoms: Hate Speech, Blasphemy, and Pornography \u2014 and his question was meant to shock.\n\n\"What is worse,\" he asked students last Tuesday, according to The Daily Princetonian, \"a white man punching a black man, or a white man calling a black man a n*****?\"\n\nThe student newspaper reports that Rosen, a white man, went on to use the racial slur multiple times in the ensuing discussion, despite increasingly strong objections from some students. Citing student accounts, the Princetonian notes Rosen defended his use of the word as \"necessary\" and intended to \"deliver a gut punch\" \u2014 but by lecture's end, several students had walked out in protest.\n\nNow, just one week later, the course is no more. It was canceled by Rosen after a weeklong storm of debate over the incident, including one criticism that the effect of his words \u2014 no matter the intent behind them \u2014 \"can only be described as personal assault, even though the injuries are not visible on the surface of the skin.\" A handful of national media outlets caught wind of the simmering controversy, as well.\n\nUniversity spokesman Michael Hotchkiss tells NPR the decision to cancel the course after just one week was Rosen's, and that the school exerted no pressure on him to do so. Rosen himself did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I respect professor Rosen's decision about how to teach the subject in the way that he did, by being explicit in using very difficult words \u2014 and they are very difficult words,\" Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber said at a previously scheduled town hall meeting Monday.\n\n\"It's a tough kind of conversation to have,\" he added, \"and I think professor Rosen himself has expressed his view \u2014 and certainly it is my view \u2014 that it is important to have the kind of conversation when people feel uncomfortable about the language and why they might or might not feel that it's appropriate to use the language.\"\n\nCarolyn Rouse, chairwoman of the university's anthropology department, also defended her colleague in a letter to the Daily Princetonian shortly after news of the incident surfaced. She wrote that this is far from the first time Rosen has begun a course in this way, \"breaking a number of taboos\" \u2014 such as saying a racial slur or having a student wipe her feet on the American flag \u2014 in order to elicit a visceral response in students and explore why.\n\nAccording to its description, the course had planned to explore the power of oppressive symbols and how \"freedom of expression is always limited, both by the harm that may be said to occur if unbridled and by the constraints of the dominant culture.\"\n\n\"This is the first year he got the response he did from the students. This is diagnostic of the level of overt anti-black racism in the country today. Anti-American and anti-Semitic examples did not upset the students, but an example of racism did,\" Rouse wrote. \"This did not happen when Obama was president, when the example seemed less real and seemed to have less power.\"\n\nYet others, including parent De'Andre Salter, see the matter in starkly different terms. Salter took to the pages of the same student paper to rebut the points of Rouse's argument the day after it was published.\n\n\"Has anyone offended by flag desecration been oppressed, discriminated against, or systemically denied civil rights? In fact, both flag desecrators and those offended by them have been offered more protections than those called 'n*****' by their oppressors,\" Salter wrote in part.\n\nTimothy Haupt, a lecturer in the writing program at Princeton, argued that though there may be teaching value in drawing out an emotional reaction, the issue rests in how Rosen handled that reaction.\n\n\"My main concern here is with Rosen's response to student discomfort and confusion, which strikes me as profoundly unproductive, because he appears to have avoided (and perhaps indefinitely postponed) an important teaching moment,\" Haupt said.\n\nHaupt noted Rouse's point about students' heightened sensitivity to examples of racism \u2014 but, he countered, \"if a shifting context has influenced how students respond to certain course material, doesn't that suggest that we as educators have the responsibility to adapt our teaching to guarantee a favorable outcome?\"\n\n\"Rosen could have stepped back, clarified the difference between using hate speech and talking about it, and then asked his class how they felt comfortable representing the term going forward \u2014 so that the conversation could continue,\" Haupt added. \"But that isn't what happened.\"\n\nStill, the university is standing by its longtime professor.\n\n\"I both believe the academic freedom is important to make the pedagogical decision and I respect the pedagogical decision that he made,\" Eisgruber said Monday, \"although I also appreciate it's a controversial one and I understand why it's controversial.\"", "keywords": ["students", "slur", "teaching", "white", "contention", "amid", "rosen", "student", "course", "words", "wrote", "cancels", "decision", "speech", "man", "hate", "professor"], "polarity": 0.0033597883597883643, "subjectivity": 0.4793452380952381},

Bill Cassidy, R-La., touted Tuesday on Capitol Hill that his plan passes the \"Jimmy Kimmel test.\"\n\nThat is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in May because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.\n\n\"I ask, 'Does it pass the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\"?' \" Cassidy, a medical doctor, said in May of Republican health care proposals. \"Will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? I want it to pass the 'Jimmy Kimmel test.' \"\n\nKimmel pressed Cassidy to follow through on his word in a tweet in June and outlined his definition of the \"Kimmel test,\" which he reiterated Tuesday night.\n\nBut Kimmel said the latest bill doesn't pass the test. He used his late night platform to knock down Cassidy's health care plan, which the GOP is trying to pass by the end of the month, point by point. He said Cassidy, whom Kimmel quizzed on his show before the plan came out, \"lied right to my face.\"\n\n\"Health care is complicated; it's boring; I don't want to talk about it,\" Kimmel said. \"The details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. They're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. But they're not taking care of you. They're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our Instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. Most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. And they want us to do the same thing. They want us to treat it like an iTunes service agreement. And this guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face.\"\n\nIn his monologue, Kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. Because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.\n\nSince states decide the rules, according to Cassidy's plan, Kimmel argues that inevitably, there will be states where caps will be instituted and families will be hurt.\n\nKimmel laid out four points that Cassidy had said he wanted in a health care bill:\n\n1. Coverage for all\n\n2. No discrimination based on pre-existing conditions\n\n3. Lower premiums for middle-class families\n\n4. No lifetime caps\n\n\"I'm sorry he does not understand,\" Cassidy said Wednesday morning on CNN about Kimmel, adding that under the new bill, \"more people will have coverage.\"\n\nThat's almost certainly not true, given the Medicaid expansion rollback that would take place under the bill. Medicaid expansion accounted for the largest drop in the uninsured under the ACA.\n\nWhat's more, Republicans are trying to push the bill through before the Congressional Budget Office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. Prior versions of Republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the ACA.\n\n\"Not only did he fail the 'Jimmy Kimmel test,' \" Kimmel said, \"it failed the 'Bill Cassidy test.' \"\n\nAs Kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. Those groans revealed something else \u2014 the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the Cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nAnd that raises another important point \u2014 in this era in which trust in politicians, Congress, Washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.\n\nThat was true of Jon Stewart when he hosted The Daily Show, and polls began to reveal that his show was a principal \"news\" source for many young people.\n\nSo it's not surprising that a popular \u2014 formerly fairly apolitical \u2014 late night host with a compelling personal storyline to draw on could have a broader effect than other traditional influencers.\n\n\"I never imagined I would get involved in something like this,\" Kimmel said. \"This is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is eating pizza, and that's really about it. But we can't let them do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us.\"\n\nFor those who say Kimmel has crossed over and become too political. He had a message for them, too: \"Before you post the nasty Facebook message saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know, I am politicizing my son's health problems, because I have to. But my family has health insurance. We don't have to worry about this, but other people do.

Steve Scalise and three others as the latest example of what they see as rising political violence from the left. Fox News' Sean Hannity accused Democrats of \"dehumanizing\" Republicans, and the right-leaning Washington Times ran an editorial by a Tea Party activist that called leftist protests \"the first skirmishes of the second American civil war.\"\n\nBut those who track extremism say that while there are a few far-left groups that raise red flags, their numbers remain small.\n\nMuch of the conservatives' anger has been aimed at \"Antifa\" \u2014 short for \"anti-fascists.\" Antifa are loosely affiliated groups of mostly young people, mainly on the West Coast but spreading around the country.\n\nThey dress in black and wear masks when they confront right-wing groups; in the past few months there have been clashes or confrontations in Berkeley, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and, just this week, on the campus of Evergreen State College, in Olympia, Wash.\n\ntoggle caption Martin Kaste/NPR\n\n\"The moment we got here, they started throwing rocks,\" says Joe Allen, one of the right-wing protesters who descended on the college Thursday to challenge what they see as its leftist ideology. They were met by a large number of the masked, black-clad counterprotesters. Allen says the Antifa have been harassing Trump supporters since Election Day.\n\n\"That night we went to downtown Portland to see what everything was like, and we got stuck on the bridge because [the Antifa were] stopping all traffic, hitting cars, jumping on cars, asking people, 'Who did you vote for?' \"\n\nA heavy presence of police in riot gear kept the confrontation at Evergreen State from escalating. The leader of the conservative protesters and the \"Patriot Prayer\" movement, Joey Gibson, was slightly injured \u2014 he said someone threw a can at his head. He later found his tires slashed. Witnesses say masked counterprotesters did it.\n\nAntifa rarely talk to reporters and rarely give their names, at least not while wearing masks. But in online discussions they say the far-right activists are being disingenuous. They point to what they regard as the racism and white supremacist ideology of the other side. They say groups such as Gibson's only pretend to be interested in peaceful political protest and would attack minorities or leftists, given the chance.\n\n\"People are desperate,\" says one masked counterprotester, a student at Evergreen State who gave his name as Felix. \"They see the government turning back to regressive Reaganomics and racist undertones and rhetoric, so once they start kicking 25 million people off health care, then you're going to start seeing riots.\"\n\nThe idea that some on the far left are openly condoning violence is a red flag for extremist group monitors.\n\n\"This is a dangerous game; people are going to die. No one's died yet, but it's just a matter of time,\" says J.J. McNabb, an expert on political extremism at George Washington University.\n\nMcNabb says white supremacists and neo-Nazis are widely condemned \u2014 and deservedly \u2014 for their violent tendencies. But she says the Antifa shouldn't get a pass on their violence just because they oppose white supremacists.\n\n\"These guys are odious, [but] attack them with words. Don't come in with sticks and nails in them,\" she says.\n\nAntifa are not new. They're a latter-day version of the anarchists and \"black bloc\" groups who, over the years, have often challenged police and broken windows during May Day protests in Seattle and Portland. Their membership is hard to track, but it appears to be expanding beyond the West Coast. They are also embracing other leftist causes beyond just fighting white supremacists.\n\nStill, their numbers are tiny in relation to the mainstream political left. And, say experts, it's misleading for right-wing groups to suggest that the Antifa are more violent than right-wing extremists.\n\n\"The far left is very active in the United States, but it hasn't been particularly violent for some time,\" says Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.\n\nHe says the numbers between the groups don't compare.\n\n\"In the past 10 years when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders,\" Pitcavage says.\n\nYou have to go back to the 1970s to find the last big cycle of far-left extremism in the U.S. Both Pitcavage and McNabb say we have been in a predominantly far-right extremist cycle since the 1990s \u2014 the abortion clinic bombings and Oklahoma City, for example. And, more recently, racially motivated attacks such as the one at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., and last month's stabbings on a commuter train in Portland.\n\nStill, Pitcavage says Wednesday's shooting attack on Republican members of Congress is a warning sign. He is especially concerned because the shooter apparently was not particularly extreme in his political ideas; his views were seemingly in the mainstream left.\n\n\"One act does not a trend make,\" Pitcavage wrote after the shooting attack. \"But I am concerned that, in this highly polarized and divided society, more people who have stances that fall within the mainstream, on the left and right alike, may consider political violence an attractive option.\"\n\nDomestic terrorism experts say that concern is only heightened by the fact that the line between what's considered mainstream and what's considered fringe is becoming increasingly blurred.", "keywords": ["rightwing", "rising", "white", "shooting", "fact", "pitcavage", "left", "political", "groups", "check", "say", "leftwing", "antifa", "violence"], "polarity": -0.026827021293313425, "subjectivity": 0.39063365473477846},

The family lives in Pacific Grove, a predominantly white, affluent area on California's Monterey Peninsula.\n\nEvery summer, Quarles' wife and children go to Germany to visit family. Consequently, Quarles spends the summers alone. And without his family around, he says, he's treated very differently.\n\nMost of the time, \"I've noticed my white counterparts almost avoid me. They seem afraid,\" Quarles tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. \"They don't know what to think of me because I'm in their neighborhood. I oftentimes wonder if they think I'm a thug.\"\n\n\"The same does not happen when I have the security blanket and shield of my children,\" Quarles says. \"When my children are with me, I'm just a dad. I love being a dad.\"\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"With kids, I'm Dad; Alone, thug.\"\n\n'Where Are You From?'\n\n\"There aren't a whole lot of African-American males in Pacific Grove,\" Quarles says. \"So I think most people do wonder, 'What is this ... black guy up to? ...

And he said, 'Well, the woman across the street is missing her purse.'\n\n\"And I looked at him, and I said, 'So, you can come in and look for it if you'd like. But no, I didn't take the purse.' \"\n\nQuarles was surprised when his neighbor approached him a few days later. He walked over to tell Quarles that he was \"really sorry about the other day.\"\n\n\"And I said, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'Well, the police went over to your house.' And I'm like, 'You sent the police to my house?' \"\n\nThe neighbor explained that he did ask the police to check them out, but his family eventually found the missing purse \u2014 in their own home. He then went on, Quarles recalls, to ask Quarles where he was from.\n\n\"And I said, 'I'm from here, Pacific Grove.' And he said, 'No, really \u2014 where did you move from before you moved here to this house?' \"\n\nWhen Quarles explained that his family had moved from their first home, nearby, \"he looked at me again and he said, 'You have two houses?' \" Quarles says the neighbor then looked at him from head to toe and asked, \"What do you do?\"\n\n\"And part of me \u2014 sometimes I mess with these people. I'll tell them, 'Well, I sell drugs and I'm a pimp. I can get you anything I want.' ... I say it deadpan serious.\"\n\nThey finally realize he's joking, Quarles says, when he starts laughing. \"And once they see the crazy hours that I work and they see me in my hospital scrubs, then they clearly know I'm not a pimp and a drug dealer,\" he says. \"I'm just a regular old hospital worker.\"\n\nLiving With A Double Standard\n\nQuarles' experiences weigh on his mind when he thinks about his children. His son, Joshua, has brown skin, while he described his daughter, Danielle, as \"very, very light. She could almost pass for white.\"\n\nQuarles knows the community and the world might treat his kids differently as they grow older, particularly with one child being lighter and the other darker-skinned. \"I think the world will have a certain idea of what they are, and what they can become, just by looking at them,\" he says.\n\nThat difference also comes into play with how his kids see themselves, Quarles says. Several years ago, he says, his daughter's teacher asked the class to write essays about what the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday meant to them.\n\nIn her essay, Quarles' daughter wrote \"that if it were not for Dr. Martin Luther King, she and her brother, Joshua, would have to go to different schools,\" Quarles says.\n\n\"She meant that she would go to one school, and that her brother, Joshua, because of his browner skin, would have to go to a school other than the school that she attended.\"\n\nQuarles and his wife wrestled with if, and how, the family should discuss the issue of skin color together.\n\nIn the end, he says, \"we decided to ... let her grow and potentially approach that conversation a little bit later. Because I think eventually, and unfortunately, someone who's a little lighter than she is with a little straighter hair, with a little blonder hair, is going to call her out and get her to understand that she does have some brown in her.\"\n\nEven so, Quarles says, \"I don't know if my wife and I are doing the right things by not talking about race that much with them.\"\n\nBut as their children get older, they're the ones who are bringing it up \u2014 like this summer, after a white police officer shot black 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nQuarles says his son \"brought it up many times, and continues to bring it up. Because he identifies with being more black than white, although he's split right down the middle. And things like that do concern him.\n\n\"As he's getting older, he's getting bigger and stronger and folks are starting to wonder about him,\" Quarles adds. \"You know, 'What is he? Why is he here?' \"\n\nQuarles responds by telling his son \"that there are simply things that he cannot do,\" he says. \"Just because of his appearance and his brown skin, there are things that he can't do that the other kids can do.\"\n\nAnd if that sounds like a double-standard, Quarles says, that's because it is. \"That's my answer: 'It is a double standard, Son. And trust me, one day, you'll understand.' \"\n\nNot that Quarles accepts double standards based on skin color. But he's had to figure out how to rise above them, he says \u2014 how to succeed by letting certain slights go. And that's the path to success for his son, too, he says.\n\n\"You can live in this world with that double standard and be successful and have a wonderful life.\"", "keywords": ["think", "thug", "wife", "children", "son", "family", "words", "kids", "skin", "hes", "im", "quarles", "dad"], "polarity": 0.05959308169982327, "subjectivity": 0.3900721968418598},

The logo is revered by some fans and considered offensive by many others.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nMajor League Baseball is phasing out a controversial logo. For years, the Cleveland Indians have used a cartoon mascot known as Chief Wahoo. Protesters have called for the team to scrap it. This was a demonstration filmed last year by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: One hundred years-plus - change the name of your baseball team, and change the logo.\n\nGREENE: Now, the team will still be known as the Indians, but next year, no Chief Wahoo. From WCPN ideastream, David C. Barnett reports.\n\nDAVID C. BARNETT, BYLINE: The image in question depicts a big-toothed, grinning caricature of a Native American. The Cleveland Indians have sported it since the 1940s. Standing at the bar of the Wild Eagle Saloon in downtown Cleveland, Cody Kinn says Chief Wahoo has always been a part of his life.\n\nCODY KINN: I grew up drawing him an art class. I mean, there's much more worse mascots out there. I mean, you got the Redskins. Their mascot's way worse than Chief Wahoo.\n\nBARNETT: The Washington Redskins have also seen protests, as have the Atlanta Braves. At the nearby Winking Lizard saloon, Benita Meiser thinks there is nothing wrong with the Cleveland logo. She proudly wears her Wahoo earrings, jackets, and T-shirts without a second thought.\n\nBENITA MEISER: It was just - always been our symbol, just like bears, cats, dogs, anything else. I never really took it any other way.\n\nBARNETT: But many did. They found it offensive and racist. Protesters have regularly boycotted Chief Wahoo on opening day. Cleveland.com sportswriter Bud Shaw says he's come out against the logo ever since 1991.\n\nBUD SHAW: People swear that they don't feel it's inappropriate or tone-deaf toward Native Americans. They feel that it's something they grew up with - their - in their childhood, and they think it's a cartoon.\n\nBARNETT: Shaw says Monday's announcement by Major League Baseball was just the other shoe dropping after Commissioner Rob Manfred announced last spring that he was working with Indians management to phase out Chief Wahoo. The image will be gone from the field, but not necessarily from the gift shop, and fans can certainly still sport their Wahoo paraphernalia. Again, Bud Shaw.\n\nSHAW: Listen, I have Indians fans in my neighborhood that feel very strongly about this, that they're not racist, they shouldn't be made to feel as if they are, that this is just something that's part of their history.\n\nBARNETT: But a new chapter of that history is set to begin on opening day in 2019.

Joined on stage by punk icon Marky Ramone and the prolific jazz artist Ron Carter, and surrounded by a packed crowd of club owners, DJs, dance activists and city employees, de Blasio joked that the soon-to-be-appointed Night Mayor of New York is \"one of the coolest job titles you could ever hope to have.\" The Office of Nightlife and its advisory group will act as liaisons between various aspects of the nightlife industry and local communities, and are modeled after similar initiatives in London, Amsterdam and other European cities.\n\nDrafted by Brooklyn Council Member Rafael Espinal (D-37), a Bed-Stuy native first elected to the New York State Assembly at the age of 26 and currently in his first term as a council member, the bill is the first in a docket of legislation that aims to support the city's vibrant nightlife culture. De Blasio's signature was the culmination of advocacy that has spanned decades.\n\nBut there is one more bill, also from Espinal and also dealing with nightlife in the city \u2014 No. 1652 \u2014 to push through City Hall, with the potential to address a pernicious, racially motivated law that has followed \"fringe\" musical scenes in the city for nearly a century.\n\nWhen Mercedes Ellington, granddaughter of jazz great Duke, stood in front of the New York City Council last Thursday, it was to testify in support of No. 1652. Introduced by Espinal earlier this year, the proposal would repeal the so-called \"Cabaret Law,\" a New York City rule established in 1926 that disallows dancing in cabarets and public halls without a special license. \"The freedom to be beyond category, to explore and express, through music and dance, is our human responsibility,\" Ellington said. \"The current cabaret laws were designed to restrict, curtail and separate those freedoms.\"\n\nIn parallel to, and urged on by Espinal's presentation of these bills, outcry over the Cabaret Law has boiled over. At last week's hearing, Brooklyn nightclub owner John Barclay, a founder of the pro-repeal Dance Liberation Network, characterized the law as being \"absurd, antiquated, racist and extremely embarrassing for our city.\"\n\nFor anyone who likes to go out at night in New York City, whatever their musical pleasure, this Prohibition-era rule has long been a running, if not especially funny, joke. Signs reading \"NO DANCING\" still hang in barrooms throughout the city \u2014 and while the law's effect is paraphrased as making it \"illegal to dance\" in New York, that description is technically untrue. What is unlawful is for a New York City establishment to host dancing without the proper license from the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\nThe current law, as explained on the City of New York's website, states that \"a place that is open to the public and sells food or drinks must have a Cabaret License to allow customers to dance.\" But according to nightlife professionals, obtaining this license is onerous, expensive and redundant, adding extra layers of paperwork to a process that already requires approval from the Department of Buildings, Fire Department, State Liquor Authority, Department of Health, commercial insurance companies and community boards, among other entities.\n\nIn a departure from past administrations, the one currently in office has pledged its unequivocal backing to the repeal. \"The Mayor strongly supports repealing the law, while retaining several security requirements key to the public's safety. We feel there are better ways than the current law to create a strong nightlife economy that doesn't endanger those involved,\" Ben Sarle, deputy press secretary for Mayor de Blasio, told NPR.\n\nNew York City's dance-music culture is especially thriving of late, and a number of key players in the scene have rallied hard for the law's repeal. Under the larger banner of Let NYC Dance, groups like Dance Liberation Network, Dance Parade, NYC Artist Coalition and others have mobilized their masses, uniting with representatives of multiple musical genres and social justice nonprofits. Council Member Espinal has connected with many of these groups, drafted progressive nightlife-related legislation and gained the support of the Mayor's office along the way.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1926, at a meeting of the Municipal Assembly of the City of New York during which the Cabaret Law was decided upon, the minutes read: \"There has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgment of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check-rein applied a little bit. ... Your Committee believes that these 'wild' people should not be tumbling out of these resorts at six or seven o'clock in the morning to the scandal and annoyance of decent residents on their way to daily employment.\" It's widely understood that the Cabaret Law was written with the intent to impose control over black clubs in Harlem and impede miscegenation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nLast week's hearing was held in the same room as that assembly 90 years prior. (Surely the fashion in the current-day chambers tends more colorful \u2014 one speaker sported transparent, four-inch-tall platform boots and sky-blue hair.) In her testimony last week, Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, a cofounder of the DJ collective Discwoman, promoter, booking agent and leader of Dance Liberation Network, posed a question both rhetorical and actual: \"Why are we hanging onto a law that has been used historically and systematically to oppress black folks and other marginalized communities?\"\n\nThe law, as it was originally written, inflicted strict curfews and specific rules upon a burgeoning jazz scene. No more than three musicians were allowed to play onstage without the venue securing the proper license, making most jazz bands verboten (that rule was declared unconstitutional in 1988). The \"cabaret card\" aspect of the law, which stood from the early '40s till 1967, demanded that all cabaret workers \u2014 from the bartender to the piano player \u2014 be fingerprinted, photographed and subject to a background check. The city capriciously revoked cards for bad behavior \u2014 Thelonious Monk and Billie Holiday were banned from gigging in NYC for periods of time because of minor drug offenses.\n\nHistorically, it wasn't just jazz that bore the brunt of the city's enforcements. News articles from the '60s detail the licensing struggles suffered by folk clubs in Greenwich Village, and the famed discotheques of the '70s and '80s often operated along the edges of legality. Following the Happy Land arson tragedy in 1990, policing stepped up at underground social clubs uptown.\n\nBut it was under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's term where the weaponization of the law was most severe. Giuliani's MARCH (Multi-Agency Response to Community Hotspots) task force worked to squelch NYC's nightlife, in reaction to grisly reports of deaths and drugs in clubland. MARCH agents would patrol bars and clubs looking for infractions such as patrons moving their bodies to music; if the venue hadn't secured the proper cabaret license, it was cause for fines, and could lead to closure.\n\nDance-music aficionados and music-industry professionals have previously tried, and failed, to strike the law. Though Giuliani's Broken Windows tactics made the city safer, it also caused some of New York's cultural capital to drain away. \"There was a moment in the late '90s when electronic-music culture was emerging into the global mainstream,\" says Eric Demby, founder of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg, and a cofounder of Legalize Dancing NYC, a group formed around 1999. \"We were going to places like Berlin, Detroit, London and San Francisco, and everyone had this cool version of the dance-music scene. But we would come home to New York, the greatest city in the world, and the city was holding back the culture.\"\n\nAttempts to repeal the law floundered in City Hall in the mid-2000s; ultimately, it wasn't the right political moment, says Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former director of the NYCLU. In 2005, Siegel brought a case to NYS Supreme Court, to judicially challenge the Cabaret Law by arguing that expressive dancing is a constitutional right. He lost. Siegel still feels that the decision in that case was wrong. The Cabaret Law is \"bad for New York,\" he says. \"Every denial of expressive activity is a serious infringement. You can't give the government an inch because then they take a foot, then they take a yard, and you wake up one morning and you don't have expressive rights any more. Dancing is a fundamental civil right.\"\n\nThough no doubt significant, \"removing the cabaret license is first a symbolic gesture to right a historical wrong,\" says Espinal. Yet there is work to be done to fine-tune the bill, and properly communicate to the public exactly what the repeal will accomplish. \"It's good symbolism, and symbolism we agree with,\" says Rob Bookman, a lawyer, lobbyist and counsel for the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an industry group. But Bookman cautions that \"repealing the cabaret law will not increase by one space, by one place, where you can legally dance.\" (The only people who might resent the law's removal are the 104, at the time of this writing, establishments in NYC who already went through the arduous licensing process.)\n\ntoggle caption Jane Lerner\n\nNightclubs in NYC are severely limited by zoning restrictions and street-level quality of life concerns, and their existences remain contingent upon the approval of numerous state and city agencies. Indeed, if the Cabaret Law disappears, the city will continue to impose a serious set of rules on nightclub operators who host dance parties.\n\n\"Dancing equals security and surveillance,\" says Barclay, the bar owner. In fact, the language around security staff and surveillance cameras that exists in the current version of the Cabaret Law will remain in the city's administrative code. \"We don't have an issue with safety regulations,\" Barclay says, but he points out that 200 people dancing in a club legally requires more security measures than a group of 1,000 watching MMA fighting at a sports bar. The creation of the Office of Nightlife is intended to address and rectify such concerns.\n\nAfter decades of attempts by activists, lawyers, and industry groups, why is the city agreeing to this reformation? A more diverse and left-leaning city government is one factor, and the current crews of pro-dance advocates have been organized and relentless, actively inspired by the national political climate. \"We're all looking for a light and this was one that felt hopeful,\" Hutchinson tells NPR. \"Even if dancing in bars isn't the most pressing issue, it's still part of the same oppressive system.\" All the players admit that finishing off the Cabaret Law, once and for all, is the right move.\n\nCouncil Member Espinal sees this work as part of a larger political picture. \"At a time when we are discussing the removal of statues with repressive history, it would only make sense [to] support removing a historically discriminatory law,\" he says.\n\nJamie Burkart, a founding member of NYC Arts Coalition, agrees. \"This is a time where we need our community spaces more than ever,\" Burkart says. \"I feel confident in 2017 that our city leaders can stand up and say that a law that was created to discriminate, a law that we have the complete power to change, is not going to stand.\"", "keywords": ["cabaret", "dance", "license", "city", "nyc", "repeal", "nightlife", "law", "dancing", "york", "legitimizes", "verging"], "polarity": 0.07187777082355395, "subjectivity": 0.41021314696013494},

But in the time he has spent writing about Civil War re-enactors, he has met many who say they do.\n\nTheir perspectives on the Confederate flag and the legacy of their ancestors prompted Dukes, a writer and radio reporter, to share his own six words with the Race Card Project: \"Must We Forget Our Confederate Ancestors?\"\n\nDukes, a Southerner himself, embedded last year with a group of Civil War re-enactors at the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, and wrote about it in a piece for the Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\n\"I just wanted to see the spectacle of the thing,\" he tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. The event, a re-enactment of one of the Civil War's most famous battles, \"was going to be like the Woodstock of re-enacting, is what everyone told me. ... I wanted to sort of understand what they got out of it.\"\n\nPart of his motivation, Dukes says, was to connect with re-enactors \"in an environment where I thought people would be comfortable talking about things like the legacy of slavery, and the legacy of Jim Crow and the legacy of racism.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the people he met weren't particularly comfortable talking about those themes, Dukes says. But they did talk when prompted, and \"everybody was kind and everybody was very welcoming,\" he notes.\n\nMany Confederate re-enactors understand, Dukes says, that the Confederate flag is associated with segregation, the KKK and lynchings. \"And invariably people would say, you know, racism was so terrible. It was an abomination. ... But that's not what I'm here to connect with,' \" Dukes says.\n\n'A History, Not A Hate, Issue'\n\nInstead, the re-enactors were there to connect with their ancestors, he says. \"Maybe not run up that exact same hill, but a simulacrum of that hill with the same sounds and the same shouts and the same visual stimulus \u2014 minus the blood and dying. And it still seemed to define their identity.\"\n\n\"I think people tried to distance their ancestors from the guilt associated with slavery, and I also think they tried to implicate everybody else,\" Dukes says. \"So, pointing out, very accurately, that slavery \u2014 the economic system \u2014 relied on the markets and the textile factories and places like that in the North.\"\n\nWhile reporting, Dukes met Sara Smith, a Confederate re-enactor from Dayton, Va. Her great-great-grandfather, Harry N. Smith, fought for the Confederacy at Gettysburg and was wounded in battle.\n\nSara Smith has Confederate flag stickers on the back of her truck \u2014 and says those who see it as a symbol glorifying racism or segregation don't understand the meaning the flag holds for her.\n\n\"I think people need to realize ... it's a history, not a hate, issue,\" Smith told Dukes. \"I think too many people get caught up in the symbol. You know, for us, it doesn't mean the same thing it means to other people. The flag that they get so upset over, was actually not a flag. It was a battle flag. It was what you formed off of to know you were on the right side\" in battle.\n\nSmith doesn't think her great-great-grandfather was fighting to preserve slavery. To her, it's \"the flag her great-great-grandfather carried up that hill in a desperate attempt to maintain his state's freedom from government interference,\" Dukes says.\n\nAnd \"if her great-great-grandfather was a good, noble, brave person who was wounded and then came home, and still lived to be something like 80, and showed so much bravery on the field, and he could carry that flag, why would it be wrong for her to put it on her vehicle?\"\n\n'Willful Innocence'\n\nDukes describes that perspective as \"willful innocence.\" It's a logic \"that says, 'OK, I have the right to love my great-great-grandfather and to admire those things in his life that are admirable, like bravery, like loyalty, like accomplishments, like survival. And because he must have been a good person, then the cause he fought for and the flag that he held must not have been a bad cause.' \"\n\nDukes says that perspective led some of the re-enactors to make the following assertion: \"People who are offended by [the flag] just don't understand what the Confederate flag really means.\"\n\nThe Confederate flag holds different significance for other Americans, as well, Dukes says. While some Southerners are well aware that the flag is often perceived as racist \u2014 and display it anyway \u2014 others display it to demonstrate their mistrust in federal government and as a symbol of resistance to federal regulation.\n\nAnd for others, Dukes says, the Confederate flag signifies an awareness that rural white Southerners, and rural Americans more generally, are often stereotyped as backward.\n\n\"I think the flag has transcended Southern identity to become [linked to] a kind of rural impoverished identity, too,\" says Dukes, who says he has even seen people display the Confederate flag in rural Maine.\n\n\"I think there are poor people in the rural South and North and all over the country who do feel like they're stereotyped and they don't have everything ... including respect ... that's due to them.\n\n\"I'm not sure that waving a Confederate flag is a great way to get that respect back \u2014 and often it is enacting the stereotype that they're trying to escape \u2014 but I do think it's a legitimate complaint nevertheless.\"\n\nDukes says he enjoyed meeting re-enactors like Smith, and doesn't \"begrudge them their weekends clad in gray, remembering their ancestors, hoisting libations and waving the battle flag,\" he writes in Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\nBut, Dukes writes, \"better to roll the flag up at the end of the weekend and leave it in the trunk until the next re-enactment.

Advocates of that campaign hit another roadblock Friday, when the Census Bureau announced it is not planning to add a MENA category to the 2020 census.\n\n\n\n\"We do feel that more research and testing is needed,\" Karen Battle, chief of the bureau's population division, explained Friday at a public meeting on 2020 census preparations.\n\nResearchers at the bureau have been looking into how to better collect race and ethnicity information from census participants of Middle Eastern or North African descent. In a report released last year, they concluded that \"it is optimal to use a dedicated 'Middle Eastern or North African' response category\" on the 2020 census questionnaires.\n\n\"The inclusion of a MENA category helps MENA respondents to more accurately report their MENA identities,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut at Friday's meeting, Battle said the bureau has received public comments that show that \"a large segment of the Middle Eastern and North African population\" think that MENA should be treated as a category not for race but ethnicity, which she said the bureau so far has not specifically tested.\n\nMany advocates for a MENA category are disappointed by the Census Bureau's decision. In a written statement, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, Maya Berry, called the announcement a \"severe blow\" to efforts to get a better count of people with roots in the Middle East or North Africa.\n\n\"Our communities, like all others, rely on representation through legislative redistricting, civil rights laws, and education and health statistics. A continued undercount will cause harm,\" Berry writes. She adds that more detailed census data could help improve access to health research and language assistance for the MENA population.\n\nBerry says advocates will turn to Congress for support in overturning the bureau's decision. She also points out that the Arab American Institute and other advocates for a MENA category have long called for the bureau to consider MENA as a category for ethnicity.\n\nThat distinction has been under consideration by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which sets the standards for how the bureau and other federal agencies collect race and ethnicity data. Right now, those standards require ethnicity to be asked on federal surveys only in terms of \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino.\"\n\nThere is a proposal, first introduced during the Obama administration, to change those standards so that all federal agencies must ask about MENA as an ethnicity or as a distinct racial group separate from \"White,\" which according to current federal standards, includes anyone \"having origins in any of the original peoples\" of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has not released any decision on the proposal. Some advocates for a MENA category have voiced concerns about the timing of this long-running policy discussion. They say they are worried about the implications of the Trump administration issuing a potential new federal requirement for more detailed MENA data more than a year after President Trump issued travel bans against MENA countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"It's really a double-edged sword,\" said Helen Samhan, a co-founder of the Arab American Institute who began campaigning for a separate MENA category in the early 1990s, in an interview before the Census Bureau's announcement on Friday.\n\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget has not responded to NPR's request for comment on the proposal. Census experts say that the bureau's announcement on Friday to not include a MENA category on its 2020 questionnaire suggests the Trump administration will not support the Obama-era proposal to change the federal standards on race and ethnicity data.\n\nIn the meantime, the bureau is under pressure to finalize how it will ask about race and ethnicity in 2020. A report on the final wording of the 2020 questions is due to Congress by the end of March, and preparations for an upcoming practice run of the 2020 census this year in Rhode Island's Providence County are well underway.\n\nOn Friday, the bureau released the questionnaire it plans to use for that practice run. The form includes a major change from the 2010 census that, while not creating a separate MENA category, could generate more detailed MENA data.\n\nThe questionnaire for this year's test run of the 2020 census asks participants who check off \"White\" to also write in their \"origins.\" And among the suggested answers are examples of two of the largest Middle Eastern and North African nationality groups in the U.S. \u2014 \"Lebanese\" and \"Egyptian.\"", "keywords": ["eastern", "standards", "ethnicity", "bureau", "middle", "census", "federal", "african", "north", "category", "mena", "2020"], "polarity": 0.13472650231124808, "subjectivity": 0.3527203022965736},

Infrastructure is one of the only policy areas that could have crossover appeal, but there has been little real movement so far on getting something through Congress.\n\nTo kick off the festivities, the president on Monday pushed his plan to privatize air-traffic control. And on Wednesday, he touted his broader infrastructure spending plan. The basic idea of this plan is that the government will spend $200 billion, using tax breaks to incentivize private business to, in turn, spend more money on infrastructure projects. Altogether, with state and local contributions as well, spending would total $1 trillion. The administration also said that it would cut regulations to help the government \"get out of the way\" of building projects.\n\nThose are the basic outlines of the infrastructure proposal that the administration has been talking about throughout Trump's first four months in office. However, there's still not a detailed plan, nothing has been introduced in Congress and answers to some big questions remain elusive.\n\nThe administration will have to figure out those details before it formally introduces its plan (and isn't simply touting it to attempt a diversion from the Comey testimony). Here are a few more of the questions the administration will have to ask itself \u2014 and, perhaps, transportation policy wonks \u2014 if the White House is hoping to implement the plan.\n\n1. Where are the details?\n\nTrump's speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday and a subsequent press release contained little new information on how his plan would work. The administration had said ahead of time that it would be announcing new spending on rural infrastructure, for example. That kind of spending might calm the fears of some rural residents, after Trump's initial budget proposed slashing rural development and transportation spending.\n\nBut in a Wednesday press release on the plan, the only details were:\n\n\"Rural America will receive grants to rebuild crippled bridges, roads, and waterways.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told NPR via email on Wednesday that there are no further details on that spending.\n\nAnd while the plan released Wednesday also said the government would spend $200 billion, it didn't say how that spending would break down \u2014 how much would be for tax credits, and how much would be for grants, for example. The White House spokesperson likewise said those details are not available.\n\nOne other question, says one expert, is what the specifics of these partnerships between the government and the private businesses will look like.\n\n\"The idea that you can spur a larger amount of infrastructure funding than the federal dollars is not, in and of itself, unique,\" said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning fiscal policy think tank. \"But it's pretty important to explain how you do it.\"\n\n2. How many jobs could it really create?\n\nTrump promotes jobs as a big selling point of his infrastructure plan. But given current economic conditions, the job creation could be underwhelming.\n\n\"The administration talks jobs, jobs, jobs, but I think most economists would recognize that we have the unemployment rate quite low,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office. \"The number of new jobs that would be created is limited.\"\n\nThere could be some economic boosts, Holtz-Eakin added, but it might not show up in those headline jobs numbers. Rather, he said, there are other potential benefits.\n\n\"It would be a productivity improvement, and that will show up in higher wages more than in higher jobs,\" Holtz-Eakin predicted.\n\nThere are also certainly other benefits of infrastructure projects \u2014 smooth roads and non-crumbling bridges, for example \u2014 but as jobs are a big selling point here, it's worth asking how big the effect would actually be.\n\nOne related question is about the nature of the projects the tax credits might spur. They are designed to incentivize building, but it's possible, Leibenluft warned, that builders would take the credits on projects they would have done anyway. \"Your hope would be that they're only supporting projects that wouldn't happen otherwise,\" he said.\n\n3. Could the plan be undercut by other federal infrastructure spending cuts?\n\nIn the president's budget proposal, the $200 billion would be spent over the next 10 years. But other infrastructure spending would take a hit over the next decade, Leibenluft pointed out in a blog post this week.\n\nThe president's budget would cut Amtrak spending, for example, and it would ensure that the Highway Trust Fund doesn't dole out any more than it takes in in revenue. The fund has some major fiscal problems, and a 2015 CBO report showed a shortfall projected to grow in the coming decade. Part of the funding issue is that gas tax revenues have fallen off. (The gas tax pays for the fund.) But how to fix the fund's shortfalls is a topic for a different article.\n\nAll of which is to say: the Trump administration's budget focuses heavily on cutting spending. But whatever infrastructure spending is cut means the trillion-dollar plan could have that much more ground to make up, both in terms of projects and economic gains.\n\n4. Will state and local governments be able to afford it?\n\nInfrastructure spending comes from a mix of federal, state and local sources. In fact, only around a quarter of total spending on transit and highways comes from the federal government, according to a May 2014 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe question then is to what degree this plan could leave state and local governments to pony up more money. Earlier information from the White House on its infrastructure proposal said the plan would \"support more communities moving toward a model of independence,\" arguing that local officials know necessary infrastructure programs better than the federal government.\n\nSome state and local officials have balked at this idea of \"self-help,\" as Bloomberg reported earlier this year, saying that they may not be able to afford the kind of investment their infrastructure needs.\n\n\"Our citizens think they're overtaxed today,\" said Oklahoma City Republican Mayor Mick Kornett, as reported by Bloomberg. \"If the idea is that we're going to somehow pass initiatives with funding to keep up the roads and the bridges and all of the infrastructure that's out there, that seems like a tough sell to me.\"", "keywords": ["budget", "white", "administration", "tax", "plan", "infrastructure", "local", "projects", "spending", "planning", "trumps", "jobs"], "polarity": 0.09981459512709513, "subjectivity": 0.3879249222999223},

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris dips into those stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThis story is about the burden of history, and how one decides to deal with it. Do we accept history as it's handed down, challenge it to command a better understanding \u2014 or ignore it as a way to find a peace of mind?\n\nCarol Zachary of Washington, D.C., has puzzled over fragments of memories from her childhood \u2014 bits of mysterious and uncomfortable history \u2014 for years. This history centers on an envelope she was given by her grandfather when she was 9 years old, and it led her to submit her six words to The Race Card Project: \"Grandfather's poker gift, a hanging invitation.\"\n\nZachary approached NPR's Michele Norris, curator of The Race Card Project, with that same envelope and its contents \u2014 items she has held onto for decades. Inside the envelope was an invitation to a hanging of three African-American men in Montana in 1917, executions her grandfather had witnessed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Carol Zachary Courtesy of Carol Zachary\n\nZachary's story begins at her grandparents' home in White Sulphur Springs, Mont., where she was visiting for the summer from Idaho. Having sassed her grandmother one day, she was punished by being forced to stay home with her infirm grandfather while the rest of the family went on a fishing trip.\n\n\"I was left with a grandfather \u2014 who has emphysema, who can't really speak much anymore \u2014 in a dark, dank cabin for an afternoon,\" Zachary recalls. \"This man, who had no idea what to do with ... girls at all, finally said to me in this barely audible voice: 'Go get a deck of cards.' \"\n\nHe taught her nine card stud. \"He never threw the game. And at the end of the afternoon, I won. I won my first game against my grandfather,\" Zachary says, beaming with pride.\n\nHer grandfather was proud of her, too, and to show his pride, he went and got that envelope for her. As she opened the double envelope, she saw what looked like a formal invitation to an execution, as well as three black-and-white photographs \u2014 pictures of the men to be hanged.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Walter Ray Watson/NPR Walter Ray Watson/NPR\n\n\"Well, I was a tomboy. I was curiosity with a 'C.' I just started to pepper him with questions \u2014 'Oh, Grandpa, what was it like? Did they lose their heads? Did their eyes bug out? Did everybody cheer? Did everybody cry?' \" Zachary says.\n\n\"And he raised a hand, which told me to shut up. And he said three words: 'It was awful.' \"\n\nAfter meeting Zachary, The Race Card Project team conducted its own reporting and discovered that invitations to hangings in the early 20th century were fairly common. \"In fact, in Montana, they were required by law,\" Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep. \"And Carol Zachary's grandfather was a county auditor, so he, by law, would have been required to attend that hanging.\"\n\nThe photos that accompany the invitation \u2014 of the three men sentenced to be hanged \u2014 are each marked with the man's name and nickname. Curiously, Norris says, they don't look like mug shots. The men are dressed up. They are wearing ties and suit jackets. \"They look like professionally lit portraitures,\" Norris notes.\n\nZachary told The Race Card project that she has always wondered whether the event was a lynching. But when she traveled to White Sulphur Springs to learn more, she found out that the hanging was legal \u2014 a fact independently confirmed by The Race Card Project team.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives\n\nEven so, Zachary still wonders how, or if, race may have been a factor in the case.\n\n\"It was a legal hanging,\" Norris explains. \"These three men were arrested for a murder that took place in the commission of a robbery. Very little is known about these men. They were said to have been railroad workers. They were called hobos in some accounts, itinerant workers. And it was the first legal triple-hanging in the state of Montana. It was a pretty big deal.\"\n\nIn reporting this story, the Race Card Project team also learned that there had been some controversy around the execution \u2014 there had even been an effort to commute the sentence.\n\n\"We came across a very thorough newspaper account in the Anaconda Standard, an article published in Butte, Mont., on the day of the hanging \u2014 Feb. 16, 1917,\" Norris says. \"The article quoted then-Montana Gov. Samuel Stewart at length, and the governor himself said he was concerned that perhaps the race of these men may have been a factor. And he determined that it was not, based on the evidence that was presented at trial. He denied clemency [and] the three men were hanged all at the same time on the morning of Feb. 16.\"\n\nWhile the team helped uncover some of the story behind these six words, and the invitation, there is still more that's not known \u2014 and that still troubles Zachary.\n\n\"It's not at all a case-closed issue for Carol Zachary. There's still a lot of mystery involving this,\" Norris says. \"The mystery of those photos and why they looked like that. The mystery of why her grandfather gave her the envelope and, despite the fact that it was a legal hanging, said it was awful. She wrestles with this. And she's careful to point out that she's not trying to say that this hanging was a mistake or some kind of miscarriage of justice, but she says it just feels incomplete to her.\"\n\nWhen Zachary first saw that envelope as a 9-year old, she was fascinated by it. But now, when she talks about the process of pulling out that envelope as an adult, she approaches it with something much closer to dread.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I saw. I remembered them as being very fierce, but as I laid them out there [years later], they were three stunningly beautiful young black men,\" Zachary says.\n\nAs an adult who has lived a life, has children of her own and has her own opinions about the death penalty, she looks at these pictures today and wonders about the message in that gesture \u2014 the fact that her grandfather gave her the envelope.\n\n\"One of the things she wonders is if he wanted her to understand that some things shouldn't make us feel good,\" Norris says. \"That even if this was a legally sanctioned hanging, that, in the end, it's the taking of someone's life \u2014 and some things shouldn't feel satisfying, even when they're dictated or sanctioned by law.\"", "keywords": ["card", "zachary", "disturbing", "wrestles", "grandfather", "men", "project", "woman", "norris", "family", "race", "hanging", "carol", "memento", "envelope"], "polarity": 0.08309132996632998, "subjectivity": 0.4417508417508417},

The team name \u2014 which has also been criticized as offensive \u2014 will not be changing.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,\" MLB's commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a statement. \"Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indians organization about the Club's use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [Indians CEO] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball, and I appreciate Mr. Dolan's acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course,\" Manfred said.\n\nRay Halbritter, a member of Oneida Nation and the leader of the \"Change the Mascot\" protest campaign, celebrated the change.\n\n\"The Cleveland baseball team has rightly recognized that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots, and the team's move is a reflection of a grassroots movement that has pressed sports franchises to respect Native people,\" Halbritter said in a statement.\n\nOther Native activists expressed more skepticism.\n\n\"It's a small step in the right direction, but it is just that \u2014 a small step,\" Cleveland activist Sundance told NPR.\n\nSundance, a member of the Muskogee Creek Nation and the executive director of the Cleveland American Indian Movement, has been a long-standing critic of Chief Wahoo.\n\n\"The team is still going to be able to license Wahoo and make money off of that racist image,\" he says. \"The environment down at the stadium is not going to change for the better. ... People are still going to wear Wahoo to the stadium, they are still going to dress in red face, they are still going to give war whoops, all under the rubric of being Indian.\"\n\nSundance was involved in a lawsuit back in 1972, attempting to force the team to drop the logo.\n\nAs Indian Country Today reports, Native resistance to the logo has continued ever since, including at annual opening day protests:\n\n\"Those Native American protesters who gather at the ironically named Progressive Field\u2014some of them members of the Cleveland American Indian Movement (AIM) and the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance\u2014have not been met with open arms or friendly words. Cleveland's baseball fans have hurled beer cans and spat on them. The protesters have been called stupid and 'Custer-killers.' Cleveland AIM calls the use of the Chief Wahoo mascot 'bigoted, racist and shameful,' and the Committee of 500 complains that the logo is a negative stereotype against indigenous people.\"\n\nProtesters have objected to the Cleveland Indians' name as well as to the Chief Wahoo image.\n\nAnd those protests will continue, Sundance says. \"We're still going to be out there on opening day, until that name is changed,\" he says.\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians praised MLB for \"setting the example for how professional sports leagues can and should respect Native peoples.\"\n\nOther sports teams \u2014 most conspicuously, Washington's football team \u2014 have also faced decades of protest and criticism for their use of offensive racial stereotypes, caricatures or slurs as official names or mascots. But notably, the debate over the Cleveland Indians logo has resulted in visible changes, as The Associated Press notes:\n\n\"Under growing pressure to eliminate Chief Wahoo, the club has been transitioning away from the logo in recent years. The Indians introduced a block 'C' insignia on some of their caps and have removed signs with the Wahoo logo in and around Progressive Field, the team's downtown ballpark. \"National criticism and scrutiny about the Indians' allegiance to Chief Wahoo grew in 2016, when the Indians made the World Series and Manfred expressed his desire to have the team eradicate the symbol. Earlier in that postseason, a lawsuit was filed while the club was playing in Toronto to have the logo and team name banned from appearing on Canadian TV. That court case was dismissed by a judge. \"The Indians' bid to host the 2019 All-Star Game, which it was ultimately awarded, further heightened debate over Wahoo.\"\n\nSupporters of the logo have expressed frustration and sorrow to see it go \u2014 and promised that it's not disappearing from stands.\n\n\"Sadly, the Indians caved to the politically correct society that we are now all forced to live in,\" Zach Sharon of Cleveland Sports Talk wrote. He said the logo is a representation of the team \u2014 one that reminds fans of the glory years of the '90s, when \"those great teams all sported the Chief Wahoo on their jerseys and those memories give myself and other fans goosebumps.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, fans will continue to wear their Chief Wahoo apparel, probably even more now,\" Sharon wrote. \"I know I will. You'll see it in the stands and around the city every Indians game. It'll never truly go away.\"\n\nCleveland lawyer and sportswriter Peter Pattakos, who opposes the logo, also predicted that the change will lead to more Chief Wahoo in stands, not less. For him, that was a cause for frustration, not celebration.\n\nPattakos spoke to NPR in 2014, after he tweeted out a viral photo of a Native man confronting an Indians fan in red face. He described how he grew from a kid who \"didn't think of a Native American at all\" when he saw the logo to an adult fan who says \"the impact is so obviously racist and demeaning.\"\n\nNow he is frustrated with how MLB decided to implement this change.\n\n\"If they acknowledge that 'the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball,' what's the excuse for waiting until 2019?\" he tweeted. And the name hasn't changed, he noted, writing, \"Cowardly half-measures won't do.\"\n\nAdrienne Keene, a Cherokee writer who runs a blog about the appropriation of Native cultures, met the news with a celebratory word \u2014 \"FINALLY!!!\"\n\nShe celebrated the fact that instead of just quietly changing the logo, MLB said it was inappropriate to use.\n\n\"Important to note: Even with this decision, you can still buy Chief Wahoo merch in Ohio and at the stadium, and the name is still the Indians,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Not done fighting, but BIG step.\"", "keywords": ["indians", "logo", "fans", "uniforms", "2019", "going", "remove", "cleveland", "wahoo", "american", "native", "chief", "team"], "polarity": 0.06528461017097383, "subjectivity": 0.40145502645502645},

This was not the intent, and for that, the Journal apologizes,\" Editor Karen Moses wrote in the paper.\n\n\"Looking back, we erred,\" Moses said in an interview with the paper. She also pledged more scrutiny of editorial cartoons in the future.\n\nThe cartoon, drawn by Sean Delonas, shows a well-dressed white couple being mugged at gunpoint by three terrifying characters: a terrorist wrapped in dynamite and holding a bloody sword, a saggy-pants-wearing member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, and a third, more generic-looking thug.\n\nThe bubble over the husband reads, \"Now, Honey ... I believe they prefer to be called 'Dreamers' ... or future Democrats ...\"\n\nRoughly 50 people showed up to protest at the paper the following day, according to the Journal. And the paper received hundreds of angry calls from readers demanding an apology.\n\nIt also drew ire from state and national leaders. Sen. Tom Udall, D- N.M., decried the cartoon on Twitter, writing, \"Words and images are still hateful and offensive, even when they appear in a cartoon.\"\n\nIn her apology, Moses said that she couldn't say what Delonas had in mind; however, her interpretation was that \"on one level it appeared to us to be poking at President Trump's rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\"\n\nBut Delonas, a former cartoonist at The New York Post, later contradicted Moses' take. In an interview with the Journal, he said the protesters' interpretation was right, adding that he believes unchecked illegal immigration has a negative impact on public safety.\n\n\"I'm not saying they can't come in; they have to come in legally, and they have to be vetted,\" Delonas said. \"I think you can call them Dreamers, but I kind of agree with Trump that Americans have Dreams, too.\"\n\nHe also told The New York Times, \"I've learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes. I'm pretty sure that the cartels are using minors for a lot of their drug dealing.\"\n\nAnd in a Facebook post, he shared his delight with the attention the cartoon has garnered. \"Today, U.S. Senators and state lawmakers (all Democrats) from New Mexico took time out of their busy pay-to-play schedules to condemn me.

People are dumping it in RECORD numbers.\"\n\nThere's evidence that ESPN is not losing subscribers because of its politics. And it is very unusual for a White House to use the bully pulpit to call for the firing of someone at a private company because that person said something it didn't like. (An anti-Trump superPAC has brought an ethics complaint against Sanders, citing federal law that states executive branch employees cannot act \"with the intent to influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity.\")\n\nBut conservatives and some journalists even within the network have been unsettled by what they see as an increasingly liberal bent from the network's commentators without balancing their perspectives.\n\nHill, who plays a dual role of host and commentator, has not been fired or suspended for her tweets. (In other tweets, she called Trump a bigot who is \"unqualified and unfit to be president.\")\n\nThe network said Hill's comments were inappropriate and that it had talked to her. Hill put out a statement via Twitter apologizing \u2014 not for the content of the tweets but for their being seen as a reflection of ESPN.\n\nThe network's public editor, Jim Brady, wrote Friday that he thought the tweets were ill-considered. For those who believe Twitter and the broadcast are separate, Brady points out that ESPN doesn't view it that way. As at other networks, public-facing employees' Twitter feeds are considered reflective of the company they work for. And plenty of people have been fired for inflammatory comments on the medium.\n\nThe irony isn't lost that the president is one person who hasn't been punished for his own incendiary tweets.\n\nLacking \"diversity of thought\"?\n\nBrady sees what happened as a bigger problem at ESPN. \"If you consume as much of ESPN's content as I have for the past 22 months, it seems clear the company leans left,\" he added. \"I don't think anyone ever made an executive decision to go that route as much as the personalities the network has promoted into high-profile positions tend to be more liberal, and as their voices are amplified, the overall voice has shifted with it.\"\n\nESPN veteran Bob Ley, host of the vaunted Outside the Lines program, told Brady in December, when Brady was exploring how ESPN was trying to adapt to current social and political upheaval, \"We've done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.\"\n\nNot too long ago, ESPN was facing criticism for its lack of diversity. There weren't very many female anchors or people of color in front of the camera. And there certainly weren't many black women on the air in prominent positions.\n\nSo the network set out to change that. Hill's show, SC6, also known on the network as The Six, was part of that change. She hosts the show with Michael Smith, a former Boston Globe reporter, who is also black.\n\nThe show is different \u2014 intentionally so. It's not the standard SportsCenter of highlights mixed in with anchor quips. Smith and Hill have a natural chemistry, express their opinions and mix in pop culture. That's what ESPN wanted, and it knew what it was getting with Hill. She's not someone in the traditional journalism mold; she has opinions, writes about them and expresses them on-air sometimes while questioning professional athletes on her program or reacting to what she just heard.\n\nShe has never shied away from sharing her perspectives. And, yes, that includes on race. That has also gotten her in trouble before. ESPN suspended her in 2008 for writing that \"rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim. It's like hoping Gorbachev would get to the blinking red button before Reagan.\"\n\nHill, a Detroit native, wrote of her hatred of Boston: \"Admittedly, to some degree it was about race. Detroit is 80 percent African-American, and as my colleague J.A. Adande stated in a fantastic piece on the Celtics earlier this season, the mostly white Celtics teams of the past had a tough time being accepted by black audiences. Boston was viewed by African-Americans as a racially intolerant city.\"\n\nShe apologized then, writing, \"I let you down. Just because I'm a black woman doesn't mean I've got an automatic sensitivity chip for cultures outside of my own. Just because I've written extensively about race doesn't render me incapable of making the same mistakes as the people I've written about.\"\n\nAlmost a decade later, Hill is in hot water again for expressing a view felt by others, especially African-Americans.\n\nDouble standards\n\nConservatives, though, see the seeming slap on the wrist for Hill in this latest controversy as a double standard. They point to, as one example of ESPN's inconsistency, Curt Schilling. The former Red Sox pitcher was fired last year as an analyst at ESPN for social media comments he made against transgender people.\n\n\"A man is a man no matter what they call themselves,\" Schilling wrote. \"I don't care what they are, who they sleep with, the men's room was designed for penis, women's not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.\"\n\nThat was accompanied by a meme showing an overweight man dressed in women's clothing, a wig and a shirt that showed his chest with the words: \"LET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you're a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.\"\n\nESPN responded in that case by saying it was an \"inclusive company\" and fired Schilling.\n\n\"Let's be very clear about something: Jemele Hill has always been a racist,\" Schilling said Wednesday on Sean Hannity's radio show, \"the things that she says, the things that she does. I don't have a problem with the fact that Jemele Hill is racist, that Bomani Jones is racist, and Colin Kaepernick knelt for a lie, and that Disney and ESPN, who they own, supports liberal racism.\"\n\nSmith, Hill's co-host, sees a different double standard \u2014 that he feels there's a higher bar for a show like theirs that is unafraid to be black, as compared with other white colleagues who have also tried to break the mold in different ways.\n\n\"When Bill Simmons does it, he's celebrated for it,\" Smith told The Ringer. \"When [Scott] Van Pelt does it, he's awesome; he's everyman; we relate to him. When Barstool does it, they're anti-establishment; they're new; they're fresh; they're the anti-ESPN. When we do it? 'Get this black s*** out of here!' That's what it feels like.\"\n\n\"Stick to sports\"\n\nA common refrain from sports fans is that they'd wish the sports people would stick to sports. Hill rejects that idea.\n\n\"When you're under the leadership of a president that refuses to condemn Nazis and racism, how am I supposed to function the rest of the day and pretend as if I give a s*** about Blake Bortles losing his job?\" Hill said during a Sports Illustrated media panel. \"That's the conversation I'm having with myself on a daily basis. I know there are sports fans looking for me to provide them with an 'escape,' but as a woman and person of color, I have no escape from the fact that there are people in charge who seem to be either sickened by my existence or are intent on erasing my dignity in every possible way. So today, my [Twitter] feed is probably a little edgier than it was. It's reflective of all the emotion and conflict I feel. I think others feel the same way.\"\n\nShe also points to coaches, like the San Antonio Spurs' Gregg Popovich, who is white and has been open about his antipathy for Trump, as well as black athletes, who have used their prominence to protest \u2014 from LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick to Muhammad Ali.\n\n\"This idea that sports has always been devoid of politics is a lie,\" Hill says in a video on The Root. \"The same person that will tell me to 'stick to sports' will also say Muhammad Ali was a great sports figure. What's the difference? The difference is now you know Muhammad Ali is right.\"\n\nSupport for Hill in the Trump era\n\nThere's been significant backlash, but believing she's \"right\" is one reason Hill has gotten so much support on social media. Here are just a few tweets, for example, compiled by black-interest magazine Vibe:\n\nThe controversy has spurred supportive columns, tooom:\n\nThe Guardian: \"Is it wrong to call Trump a white supremacist?\"\n\nCosmopolitan: \"Jemele Hill Called Donald Trump a White Supremacist. Where's the Lie?\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribune: \"As Trump seethes over ESPN anchor's tweet, a movement breathes to life.\"\n\nErik Wemple at The Washington Post ran down a list of \"just a few of the examples of our president's refusal to apologize when confronted with his racism and bigotry.\"\n\nAnd Trump himself stepped back into controversy on race this week by doubling down on his Charlottesville comments.\n\n\"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One of an anti-fascist movement that has at times resorted to violent tactics against white supremacists. \"And essentially that's what I said.\"\n\nTrump added this defense: \"Now because of what's happened since then, with antifa, you look at, you know, really what's happened since Charlottesville \u2014 a lot of people are saying \u2014 in fact, a lot of people have actually written, 'Gee, Trump might have a point.' I said, 'You got some very bad people on the other side also,' which is true.\"\n\nWhile Trump has condemned white supremacists and the KKK, he has also been criticized for attempting to create a moral equivalency between white-power groups and protest groups on the left.\n\nRemarkably, Trump's latest comments came in response to a question about his meeting with Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate. Scott had been hotly critical of Trump's Charlottesville response and had requested a meeting hoping a one-on-one appeal could bridge a divide with Trump.\n\nThat's where the U.S. is right now \u2013 a country split when it comes to perceptions of race and usually along racial and, increasingly, political lines. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found a majority didn't think Trump's response to Charlottesville was strong enough, but there was a sharp political divide \u2014 almost three-quarters of Democrats thought Trump's response was not strong enough, while a strong majority of Republicans thought it was strong enough.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat partisan divide was equally pronounced when it came to views of race relations more broadly. Again, nearly three-quarters of Democrats thought race relations had worsened in the past year while just a third of Republicans thought so.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe \"post-racial America\" some touted when Obama was elected was always a myth. To become the first black president \u2014 and to be re-elected \u2014 Obama had to walk a delicate line on race. Some black thinkers and writers weren't always happy with him because of that, and conservatives were rankled by his responses to the spate of police shootings of black men in his latter years.\n\nIn a country changing demographically, race relations moved to the front burner during the Obama era \u2014 and the pot boiled over with Trump's election.\n\nJemele Hill is just the latest example.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\n\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\". Those six words form the title of a song from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's South Pacific, the wildly popular musical revolving around cross-cultural love affairs in the South Pacific during World War II.\n\nThat phrase \u2014 \"You've got to be carefully taught\" \u2014 is also a popular entry in The Race Card Project's inbox. More than a dozen people have offered submissions quoting those six words in some way.\n\nLet's begin with a little context. The musical South Pacific, which opened on Broadway in 1949, won several Tony Awards the following year. Then, years later, it became a hit movie.\n\nTo say South Pacific was successful would be an understatement \u2014 it was a blockbuster. But it also drew critics and controversy. It covered uncomfortable territory. Its romantic tension was based on interracial romance, a strong taboo at the time.\n\nEven so, the soundtrack topped the charts. Songs like \"Some Enchanted Evening\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" were in heavy rotation on the radio and on record players around the country.\n\nAnd judging from the inbox at The Race Card Project, the message behind the song \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" has resonated with those who love the South Pacific soundtrack, like Kathleen Ziegler of Lino Lakes, Minn. She says she first heard that song on her family's record player.\n\n\"I had three older sisters,\" she says. \"We used to put the records on a lot, as we were cleaning, especially. And we'd have it turned way up and we learned all the songs.\"\n\nThe sisters would sing together, Ziegler says, and the lyrics to \"You've Got to Be Taught\" stay with her, even today.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo hate and fear, you've got to be taught from year to year\n\nIt's got to be drummed in your dear little ear\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo be afraid of people\n\nWhose eyes are oddly made\n\nAnd people whose skin is a different shade\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\n\"I just remember hearing [the lyrics] when I was young, and it made me very sad,\" Ziegler says. \"I had parents who did exceptionally love us and taught us to do the same. And I just thought, how can people be taught to hate, especially children?\"\n\nZiegler was raised by parents of German descent during World War II. She remembers that the patriotism of that time was also steeped in bias.\n\n\"One of my earliest memories is knowing that you were supposed to hate 'Japs.' We used to say, 'Bombs over Tokyo,' and drop something on the ground,\" she says. \"I never thought of it as being a hateful thing \u2014 then.\"\n\nBut those are words she would never say today, Ziegler says. \"No, no. That's offensive. [But] that was what we were taught. Or, what we heard.\"\n\nSeveral people have referenced \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" in their six-word submissions to The Race Card Project. Follow the links below to learn more about why, decades after its release, the song still resonates with each of them. Claire Rosenbaum, Cumberland, R.I. Katherine Roskam, Charlotte, N.C. Leigh Slater, Hagerstown, Md. You can't be friends with her \u2013 Rosie W., Tucson, Ariz.\n\nLove Stories With A Cultural Twist\n\nWhat people hear and see in South Pacific are classic love stories with a thorny cultural twist. What happens, for instance, when \"boy meets girl\" becomes \"all-American boy meets Asian girl in wartime setting\"?\n\nPerhaps Oscar Hammerstein was challenging the democratic principles at stake in World War II. In 1958, Hammerstein was on The Mike Wallace Interview, hosted by Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes fame. \"South Pacific had two love stories in it,\" Hammerstein told Wallace. \"They both concern, in a different way, race prejudice.\"\n\nIn the interview, Hammerstein explained that one of the love stories involves a plucky American woman named Nellie Forbush.\n\n\"Nellie Forbush, the Navy nurse, is in love with a Frenchman, and when she finds out that he was once married to a Polynesian woman and has two Polynesian \u2014 no, half-Polynesian \u2014 children, she runs away,\" he explained.\n\n\"She's shocked by it, and she's awakened later when she fears he's dead, and then suddenly she realizes how unimportant was her prejudice, how important it was that she loved him and how much she wants him back, no matter what kind of children he has,\" he said.\n\n\"What we were saying was that ... all this prejudice that we have is something that fades away in the face of something that's really important,\" Hammerstein told Wallace.\n\nSo, love wins ... sometimes. Because the other love story, Hammerstein explained, \"is about a young Marine who falls in love with a Tonkinese girl on the island.\"\n\nWell \u2014 spoiler alert: Despite the burning desire between Lt. Cable and the island girl, named Liat, their differences keep them apart.\n\nA Deliberate Message?\n\nAt the time of South Pacific's release, its theme of racial and romantic tolerance was just too much for some. Some members of the military complained that \"Carefully Taught\" ruined the flow of the musical.\n\nWhen the show went on national tour in the 1950s, two Georgia state lawmakers were repulsed after seeing it, and said a song justifying marriage between races was offensive. One of them, Rep. David C. Jones, wrote in a letter, \"We in the South are a proud and progressive people. Half-breeds cannot be proud.\"\n\nScholars suspect that Hammerstein knew he would strike a nerve with South Pacific. He had tucked liberal messages into previous productions.\n\nLarry Maslon, a Broadway historian who teaches at the graduate acting program at New York University, says he has always thought of Oscar Hammerstein as a preacher, \"In the way that I think of Abraham Lincoln as a preacher, or Leonard Bernstein as a preacher. Lincoln used the White House, Bernstein used the conductor's podium, and Oscar used the theater,\" he says.\n\n\"And all of his shows offer a kind of benign choice, it seems to me: that tolerance is probably better than prejudice; that enlightenment is probably better than ignorance,\" he says. \"And I think he appealed, in the way that Lincoln did, actually, in his second inaugural address, to the better angels of our nature.\"\n\nNearly 70 years ago, Hammerstein's message of tolerance was largely about race and romance. But on so many levels \u2014 race, sexual orientation, class, religion, gender \u2014 the challenge of reaching across differences is still relevant today.", "keywords": ["carefully", "pacific", "hammerstein", "intolerance", "race", "words", "used", "taught", "south", "love", "youve"], "polarity": 0.11669696969696969, "subjectivity": 0.5028549783549786},

As the phenomenon displaces communities of color, from Inglewood to Washington, D.C., \"gentrification\" has been co-opted to include food and culture as well. So, what does the loaded term really mean?\n\nAccording to urban sociologist John Schlichtman, gentrification cannot happen without disinvestment. In the book Gentrifier, Schlichtman and his co-authors, Marc Hill and Jason Patch, define gentrification as \"the reinvestment of real estate investment money or capital into dis-invested, devalued, centrally-located neighborhoods, which fosters a new infrastructure for middle and high-income residents.\"\n\nThe reason gentrification has a bad rap is due to the inequity between race and housing. \"Race is, at its heart, a class issue,\" Schlichtman says. The devaluing of lower-class neighborhoods, usually residents of color, is the result of a history of unjust policies, including government defunding and redlining.\n\n\"There is an unusual gap between the devaluing and the revaluing in the United States,\" Schlichtman says. \"How that gap is filled needs to be controlled. We can't just let a tsunami of investment fill that gap. It's obviously going to wash things away.\"\n\nSchlichtman spoke with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about the complexities of gentrification, who's responsible for it and how we can minimize the pain it causes through a conscious shifting of priorities.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nWho is a gentrifier?\n\nA gentrifier is a middle-class person who moves into a disinvested context at a time when other people are doing the same. And, that middle-class person is bringing middle-class buying power. And that effect occurs regardless of the racial, religious, class upbringing of that individual. But they're entering into a context in which that devaluing occurred through decades and decades of unjust policies: defunding by the government, redlining, racial covenants, blockbusting.\n\nOn \"gentrifier guilt\"\n\nThat guilt is felt because there is a perception that someone is benefiting from an unjust gap. The first question I ask in regards to gentrifier guilt is: What is the just context for a middle-class housing consumer? Is it the suburb? Is it the devalued neighborhood? Is it the bottom of a middle-class enclave in the city that has never had the devaluing? Is that the just context?\n\nThere are many people of all backgrounds in the United States who are struggling with their housing choice and trying to figure out what the ethical footprint of their housing choice will be. I would argue that we have painted ourselves into a corner because of our history in the United States where there isn't a just housing choice.\n\nOn advice for people who have moved into a gentrified neighborhood\n\nYou can't behave your way out of gentrification, but you can be a kind person. Much of the pain that occurs as a result of gentrification is the result of people who move into neighborhoods and they're imagining a future neighborhood. So no, supporting businesses that are currently existing, that's not going to stop gentrification but it is going to make people like you more.\n\nI think people need to own where they live; don't say you can't live somewhere else if you're middle-class. You could live in that suburb that isn't gentrifying. You could live at the bottom end of that middle-class community in the city that isn't gentrifying. But, there are other things that you're looking for. You're looking for class diversity, a racial diversity, an ethnic diversity. You're looking for restaurants; you're looking for a specific type of architecture. So, be honest about your housing choice.\n\nAnd finally, this needs to be fought with large-scale things. We need to put pressure on our city governments as a community to not put profit and investment as the number one priority. It can be balanced with other priorities of community.", "keywords": ["housing", "choice", "gentrifier", "live", "neighborhoods", "enabled", "middleclass", "gentrification", "schlichtman", "looking", "isnt", "pains", "weve", "youre"], "polarity": 0.09289772727272726, "subjectivity": 0.4699179292929293},

It can affect your identity, your relationships and whether or not you \u2014 or your children \u2014 may become a citizen of your tribe.\n\nBlood quantum was initially a system that the federal government placed onto tribes in an effort to limit their citizenship. Many Native nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, still use it as part of their citizenship requirements.\n\nAnd how tribes use blood quantum varies from tribe to tribe. The Navajo Nation requires a minimum of 25 percent \"Navajo blood,\" and Turtle Mountain requires a minimum of 25 percent of any Indian blood, as long as its in combination with some Turtle Mountain.\n\nBlood quantum minimums really restrict who can be a citizen of a tribe. If you've got 25 percent of Navajo blood \u2014 according to that tribe's blood quantum standards \u2014 and you have children with someone who has a lower blood quantum, those kids won't be able to enroll.\n\nSo why keep a system that's decreasing your tribe's rolls and could lead to its demise?\n\n\"I use the term 'Colonial Catch 22' to say that there is no clear answer, and that one way or another, people are hurt,\" says Elizabeth Rule. She's a doctoral candidate at Brown University who specializes in Native American studies, and also a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation.\n\n\"The systems are so complicated,\" she explains, \"but it's all part of tribes deciding on their own terms, in their own ways, utilizing their own sovereignty [to decide] what approach is best for them.\"\n\nAs we explored blood quantum in this week's episode, we thought a primer of what, exactly, this system is and how it works \u2014 or doesn't \u2014 might be useful. Here's my interview with Elizabeth Rule, edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nFirst of all, what's blood quantum?\n\nBlood quantum simply is the amount of \"Indian blood\" that an individual possesses. The federal government, and specifically the Department of the Interior, issues what is called a \"Certified Degree of Indian Blood,\" and that is a card similar to an ID card. So the way that blood quantum is calculated is by using tribal documents, and usually it's a tribal official or a government official that calculates it.\n\nBut really it's a mathematical equation. So the quantum is a fraction of blood that is derived going back to the original enrollees of a tribe who were counted on Census rolls, and then their blood quantum was documented, and usually those original enrollees had a full blood quantum. Typically.\n\nHow did people know that those original enrollees had \"full blood quantum\"?\n\nWell, they didn't. And that's that's one of the major problems with blood quantum today is that a lot of times, the people taking the rolls were federal government officials who were unfamiliar with Native ways of establishing and defining their own communities.\n\nAnd so, for example, these officials would mark someone potentially as \"full blood\" when potentially that person was not. And that assumption was based on their appearance, on their level of cultural involvement with their community.\n\nBut a great example for how to understand this problem in real life is that there is a history of freedmen who are black individuals who were living as fully incorporated members of Indian tribes. And when these original roles were taken, oftentimes these freedmen were not included, even though those individuals may be of mixed heritage: black and Indian. Because of their black appearance, they were listed on a separate roll. And today, the ramification is that they do not have that original enrollee [in their past]. They do not have enough blood quantum, and therefore oftentimes cannot be extended tribal membership.\n\nCan you talk to me about how the concept of blood quantum came to be used for Native tribes?\n\nCertainly, American Indians have been racialized. But our primary identity continues to be a political one. Blood quantum really emerges as a way to trace race between generations of Native people starting at the turn of the 20th century. And again, I think it's helpful to understand the way that blood quantum works through another example that people may be more familiar with \u2014 and that's the \"one drop rule.\"\n\nBlood quantum emerged as a way to measure \"Indian-ness\" through a construct of race. So that over time, Indians would literally breed themselves out and rid the federal government of their legal duties to uphold treaty obligations.\n\nThe one drop rule measured the amount of \"black blood\" that black people had in society. And that ensured that every person who had at least one drop would be considered black and would be covered under these discriminatory laws and, even in the earlier days, enslaved.\n\nBlood quantum emerged as a way to measure \"Indian-ness\" through a construct of race. So that over time, Indians would literally breed themselves out and rid the federal government of their legal duties to uphold treaty obligations.\n\nOne of the questions that kept coming up is: OK, so why don't tribes just ditch these blood quantum requirements and switch to an enrollment requirement that uses lineal descent? (Lineal descent basically means that, if your ancestors were enrolled in a tribe, you can be, too.)\n\nThat is the question of the century. And first, I want to be clear that I don't intend to speak on behalf of any specific tribes or even on behalf of my own, but I'm happy to walk you through some of those arguments that exist in support of maintaining blood quantum requirements for tribal membership. ...\n\nThe thing that I've found to be most interesting about both arguments \u2014 in support and against blood quantum requirements \u2014 is the language of survival. So, lineal descendant supporters think about high memberships through the lens of existence as a resistance right. And so there's a desire to build up tribes' numbers and capacity in order to survive and perpetuate the tribe.\n\nOn the other side, those who defend blood quantum requirements also evoke this language of survival, and they look upon those blood quantum minimums as a way to preserve an already existing closed community that's very close and ... usually very culturally connected.\n\nEven though they're using what a lot of people say is a \"Colonialist construct\"?\n\nYes. And I don't think that anyone would argue that it isn't that. That history is very clear. But, tribes today of course have to adapt, and blood quantum for some tribes in their view has been a way to preserve their community.\n\nI also want to emphasize that it is the tribe's sovereign right to determine their own membership and whether that involves a blood quantum minimum or lineal descent system.\n\nUltimately their decision has to be respected in order to uphold tribal sovereignty.\n\nYou've used the phrase \"personal gains\" before to refer to some people who might've claimed Indian heritage. Can you walk me through what specifically those personal gains look like?\n\nYou hear every time a tribe changes over to lineal descent, or that there is a newly recognized tribe, for example, that usually there's a mass group that's interested in joining. And potentially, some of those incentives would be financial gain if the tribe, for example, has gaming revenue or other industries. Of course, there is a desire on some individuals' part to claim an identity for affirmative-action purposes. But again, I would say that is certainly the minority of this side of the cases. But it does happen and I just want to point it out again to show that there are difficulties on both sides and that there's not a clear-cut answer yet.\n\nIf each tribe is able to determine their own their own enrollment requirements, are there any tribes out there that you've heard of that are deciding to forego lineal descent and blood quantum \u2014 and deciding to use another completely different method?\n\nI have heard of one example in Canada, where a First Nation has decided to open enrollment to people who have no Indian ancestry at all. Meaning that those individuals don't meet the federal Canadian requirements of being a \"status Indian,\" and they also don't have that blood quantum or descendancy from an original enrollee. It's an extremely progressive and interesting move, and they're really changing the game.\n\nListen to our episode on blood quantum from earlier this week, and check out this essay from Savannah Maher, a former NPR producer, about her own struggle with blood quantum.", "keywords": ["requirements", "way", "tribe", "tribes", "quantum", "blood", "indian", "original", "thats", "native", "exactly"], "polarity": 0.17658166267389575, "subjectivity": 0.4690732568402472},

(More on this later.)\n\nOn Saturday, downtown Washington, D.C. was home to three prominent demonstrations that some feared might combine violently but instead stayed largely separate and peaceful, with modest attendance.\n\nThe self-described Mother of All Rallies, designed to support President Trump and \"defend American culture,\" was staged on the National Mall late Saturday morning.\n\nAround the same time and several blocks away, near the White House, was the Protect American Democracy rally, which organizers say was meant to tell the president to take a tougher stance against Russian interference in American elections.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Logan Werlinger for NPR Logan Werlinger for NPR\n\nThe rally garnering the most attention was the Juggalo March, an assembly set near the Lincoln Memorial of so-called Juggalos. The fans of the horror-core rap duo Insane Clown Posse are often adorned in face paint, tattoos and other symbols similar to those of the group. The march was described on its website as \"a collective statement from the Juggalo Family to the world about what we are and what we are not.\"\n\nInsane Clown Posse was founded in 1989, and despite criticism of the group's crude and sometimes violent lyrics, it developed a considerable and dedicated following of Juggalos. (The term derives from a 1992 Insane Clown Posse song, NPR's Tanya Ballard Brown reported.)\n\nIn a 2011 report, the FBI classified Juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang\" following violent incidents allegedly committed by fans of group. Juggalos, in tandem with the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the government in 2014, claiming Juggalos' \"constitutional rights to expression and association were violated\" by the FBI's classification. The case was dismissed but then later reinstated in September 2015.\n\nAnd, according to the event website for the Juggalo March, the case has been thrown out for a second time, \"meaning we are back to square one from a legal standpoint,\" the group says.\n\nThe case was dismissed both times by the same Michigan judge who said the Juggalos lacked \"legal standing,\" The Guardian reports. The fan base will now have to wait at least six months for a ruling on the ACLU's second appeal, the newspaper adds.\n\nThe Juggalos say the gang label has, through unfair discrimination, made it difficult to live a normal life for many of their members, some of whom were scheduled to speak on Saturday as part of the effort to express their anger with the FBI.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\n\"We are taking out [sic] fight to the streets.

The rally's organizers wrote on their website that Confederate flags and racism would not be allowed, clearly hoping to distinguish their event from the march of white supremacists that turned deadly last month in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nNevertheless, as NPR's Windsor Johnston reported, some counterprotesters attempted to tie the MOAR rally to Charlottesville, including one who held a sign featuring an image of the woman killed by a motorist there.\n\nOfficials kept the protesters far from one another, which, along with a heavy police presence, appeared to keep the Saturday events peaceful, reported WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons.", "keywords": ["juggalo", "posse", "werlinger", "clown", "image", "logan", "washington", "political", "typical", "juggalos", "rallies", "american", "dc", "plus", "caption"], "polarity": -0.04099714839151458, "subjectivity": 0.409023370995202},

Board of Education, a yearlong ProPublica investigation found that many schools across the country are back where they were under Jim Crow segregation: racially isolated and under-resourced.\n\nIn Tuscaloosa, Ala., the story of the Dent family underscores what's happened to schools in that city over the past three generations.\n\nJames Dent, a 64-year-old African-American, described watching the roller coaster of integration in his city \u2014 from segregation to integration and now back to segregation, Norris says.\n\nOther Tuscaloosa Students Share Their Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Sophie Fairbairn On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Ryan Foster On His Six Words toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Jazmine Thompson On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica James Niller On His Six Words\n\nHis six words for The Race Card Project: \"We went to all-black schools.\"\n\nDent and his wife were part of a generation that saw promise in school integration. And for a time, the local high school, Central High, was a model for integration. Central produced National Merit scholars and winning baseball, football and basketball teams. The school dominated the math championships. Dent's daughter went there and had a great experience.\n\nBut, as ProPublica found, it was hard to maintain that level of integration. First, white families started to peel away. Then, over time, something else happened: \"bright flight.\" Middle-class black families also peeled away from the neighborhood, leaving it not just racially isolated but economically isolated as well.\n\n'A Lot Happens Over Here'\n\nThose shifts had a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa. Today, schools in the Dents' neighborhood, like Central High, have a white population of less than 1 percent.\n\n\"You see Central getting smaller and smaller,\" James Dent says. \"I don't know why. Central High School is getting smaller and smaller.\"\n\nDent's wife, Beverly, has some opinions as to why. \"A lot happens over here, for one thing,\" she says. \"You know, like shootings, robbery and stuff like that \u2014 that happens over here. Now, it might happen on [the white] side too, but I think it happens over here a lot more than it does over there. And the whites are scared.\"\n\nThere are other schools in the city with more resources than Central. Those schools, like Bryant High, have relatively large white populations. And the larger community views the schools differently, Beverly Dent says.\n\n\"I think Central is not \u2014 what's the word I'm looking for? They look at Central lower than they do Bryant,\" Beverly says. Once upon a time, she says, \"when you went out in the world and said you were from Central, people would say, 'Wow, that's a good school.' ... You got a lot of good people coming out of there, going to college and stuff.\"\n\nBut James Dent's granddaughter, D'Leisha Dent, has had a different experience. She's about to graduate from Central High, and has her own six words for The Race Card Project: \"Segregation should not determine our future.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old is very proud of her school, with its large brick building just a stone's throw from the University of Alabama.\n\nBut as the neighborhood changed, the school changed. D'Leisha says she's especially aware of that when she hears her mother, Melissa Dent, talk about Central High's heyday \u2014 during that brief period when it was integrated. Melissa had friends of all races, including people she still keeps in touch with today.\n\nBut things are different for D'Leisha.\n\n'I'm Gonna Stay On It'\n\n\"Me and my friends always talk about how we wish the schools were not segregated. And, like, we wish we could interact with more Caucasian people, 'cause they seem fun,\" D'Leisha says. \"I don't really know how they are outside of school, but I wish we could have interacted with more people.\"\n\nAnd the community, D'Leisha says, doesn't \"expect much\" from Central students. \"They have low expectations from us. ... It's just some people \u2014 they expect low. They don't expect anything from Central High School.\"\n\nBut D'Leisha has her own inner compass, Norris says. And like so many other high school kids right now, D'Leisha runs to the mailbox every day looking for a college admission letter.\n\n\"I do what I have to do,\" D'Leisha says. \"I'm in honors class, AP \u2014 advanced placement \u2014 and don't settle for less.

You may also see other T-shirts and signs in response, proclaiming \"all lives matter\" or \"blue lives matter.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget that a phrase that has become so ubiquitous came about just a few years ago in 2013, by the efforts of three women: Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Khan-Cullors.

We're in Ferguson, and there's a tank on the street.' And it was this very, very powerful, visceral moment for me.\"\n\nPatrisse Khan-Cullors describes how all this came about in a new book, When They Call You A Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir, co-written with journalist asha bandele. We spoke at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nWhy it matters that Black Lives Matter was started by women\n\nFor all the reasons why it's been a struggle for people to believe that it's been started by women. Honestly, there's some people I've talked to who've been in shock: 'Oh, I had no idea \u2014 I thought it was a man who started Black Lives Matter.' I think it's important for the legacy of black women who have been at the helm of movements to identify who the founders of something are. It's why it was so important that there was an intervention when Alyssa Milano started Tweeting #MeToo, and Tarana Burke had created #MeToo 10 years ago, right? There's a way in which it is easy to literally steal black women's work and not feel anything about it. And I think it's important because we've laid a foundation around challenging patriarchy as part of the movement, and I don't think that three men would have had that at the center of their movement for black people.\n\nWhy Black Lives Matter evokes a visceral response in some\n\nThe psychosis of whiteness is that it centers itself always. And when it is de-centered, when a group of people \u2014 but specifically black people, I think there's something about black people being visible or black people getting some threat of power that shakes up white people and their whiteness, that shakes up their experience of what should be true. I think there is a deep desire from even well-meaning white people to believe that they're not racist. But the reality is if you live in this country, if you're born and raised as a white person, then you most definitely are racist, and you have to contend with that. And I think Black Lives Matter puts it in peoples' face to deal with not only the ways in which they benefit from whiteness and white supremacy, but deal with the ways in which black people actually must be free. And I think that's actually hard to contend with.\n\nWhat she says to those who perceive Black Lives Matter as anti-white\n\nIt's unequivocally not true. Black Lives Matter is really Black Lives Matter Too. It is not a phrase that is about excluding \u2014 it's a phrase that is about focus. We are focusing on black people because time and time again, we become the subjects of neglect.\n\nOn being labeled a terrorist\n\nThe first time I would see our organization, and me, and other people be labeled as terrorists, and then our faces be put on national television, was on Bill O'Reilly's show when he was still on air, would be scrolling through Breitbart. And knowing that these right-wing pundits had audiences ... it was painful because it was such a lie, but it was also scary, because the impact of being labeled as terrorists and receiving death threats \u2014 both in my email and on phone calls \u2014 really started to shape my understanding of how serious, how unsafe I was, how unsafe I was out in the world when all I ever wanted was safety for myself and black people.

And at Thursday's championship parade, you'd likely hear many of the same full-throated chants that we heard right after the win. The Eagles fight song, obviously. Some colorful suggestions for what the vanquished Tom Brady could do to himself, also obviously. And then another, more charged exhortation: Free Meek Mill!\n\nMeek Mill, whose real name is Robert Williams, is one of the highest profile rappers ever to come from Philly. And when the Eagles ran out onto the field on Super Bowl Sunday, they did so over Meek's \"Dreams and Nightmares,\" a song that they had been playing at the team's practices since the playoffs began.\n\nThe Eagles picked \"Dreams and Nightmares\" as their hype song for functional reasons \u2014 it's a song about overcoming long odds and constructed to make you feel like you can run through a brick wall \u2014 but there was something political about the choice as well. Meek had been on probation for nearly a decade stemming from a gun conviction in 2008, when he was 21. Then last year, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating those probation terms. He had a long and spotty probation history, with a grip of failed drug tests and missed court appearances, some of which extended his probation.\n\nNone of which is especially remarkable for people on probation, which is exactly why he has become a poster boy for critics of the criminal justice system. They point out that failing a drug test, or driving outside of the county, or failure to hold down a job are not jailable offenses for anyone but probationers. For Meek, the violations that finally got him sent to prison were an airport fight and a reckless driving charge for popping a wheelie on a motorcycle in a video he posted to Instagram, even though charges in both instances were dropped. (Several Eagles players had expressed public support for Meek after his sentencing and showed up at a rally in Center City last fall to protest his incarceration.)\n\nThere are many, many people of far less means than Meek Mill in similar binds \u2014 ostensibly free, but constrained by their probation terms. (Imagine trying to find a job or public housing with a felony conviction and restrictions on where you can travel.) There are currently more Americans on probation than on parole, in prison or in jail combined \u2014 and the racial disparities in probation are as stark as they are in every other part of our criminal justice system. A 2014 study by the Urban Institute found that across four different counties in the U.S., black probationers were 55 percent more likely to have their probation revoked than white people were.\n\nMeek's story comes just as Philadelphia rethinks its approach to crime and punishment. For decades, Philly's district attorneys have been notoriously tough on crime, which is one reason the city currently has the highest incarceration rate of the 10 largest U.S. cities. But the current mayor, Jim Kenney, ran on a platform of police reform and getting rid of stop-and-frisk. And the new DA, Larry Krasner, is a former defense lawyer who made his name suing the police department, wants to abolish cash bail and was championed by activists from Occupy Philly and Black Lives Matter. (As you might imagine, that has not always engendered them to the city's police and prosecutorial brass.)\n\nIt's fitting, then, that the Eagles managed to smuggle a little of this messy context, however briefly and however elliptically, into the Super Bowl. The NFL tried its best to hermetically seal the game off from the tensions roiling the wider world. Any notion that the NFL existed outside the sphere of politics was always a tortured fiction, and it was demolished for good this season, when the biggest storyline was the on-field protests around race and the criminal justice system. In a move that seemed especially aimed at reassuring fans who might have been turned off by that kneeling, and felt it unpatriotic, there was an especially showy celebration of several World War II veterans during the coin toss. There was no visible protest on display that day, not even from Malcolm Jenkins, the Eagles outspoken safety.

It was inappropriate and highly insensitive,\" Linton said in a statement from her publicist, according to a report from CNN.\n\nIn case you're unaware, here's what happened: Linton, who apparently frequently travels with her husband, Steven Mnuchin, posted an image of herself as she glamorously walked off a U.S. government jet in Kentucky.\n\nThe photo is not unlike those often posted to the same social media platform by first daughter Ivanka Trump and first lady Melania Trump. However, in Linton's case, she also tagged a number of high-end designer items she was wearing. Here's part of what she listed:\n\n\"Great #daytrip to #Kentucky!\" #nicest #people #rolandmouret pants, #hermesscarf, #tomford sunnies, and #valentinorockstudheels\n\nThe unusual label-laden post prompted Jenni Miller, a mother of three from Portland, Ore., who had wrongly assumed that taxpayers were footing the bill for Linton's trip, to write, \"Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable.\"\n\nThat set off Linton who responded with a screed of personal attacks against Miller and her family:\n\n\"Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You're adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute. I know you're mad but deep down you're really nice and so am I. Sending me passive aggressive Instagram comments isn't going to make life feel better. Maybe a nice message, one filled with wisdom and hunanity [sic] would get more traction. Have a pleasant evening Go chill out and watch the new game of thrones. It's fab!\"\n\nSince the outburst, Linton has made her Instagram profile private and she's reportedly deleted the photo. She has also received a lot of attention in the past day for being, well, out of touch.\n\nIt has been perceived to be in especially bad taste in light of the purpose for the trip. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and film producer, was in Louisville, Ky., to discuss the nation's debt ceiling and a broad tax overhaul \u2014 which the White House contends will alleviate economic strain on middle class aka \"cute\" families \u2014 with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nWithout getting into the dollar amount that any single person pays toward federal taxes, or how much of their income that may represent, it is valuable to establish some kind of context for the value of the items Linton boasted about.\n\nAnd, here are a few additional takeaways from the now-deleted photo.\n\n(1) A picture is worth $16,322.71 (plus the cost of a billowy white blouse)\n\nA Treasury Department official assured the Washington Post that the Mnuchin-Linton household personally covers the extra cost of travel for the Treasury secretary's wife, though they did not disclose what that added up to on this particular trip. Additionally, the official stated that Linton was not compensated by any of the labels she tagged in the photo.\n\nWhile the public may not be privy to the exact price tag for Linton to tag along with her husband, it is possible to approximate what it costs to deplane a government-owned jet outfitted in the expensive labels Linton felt compelled to identify and one she managed to leave out.\n\nBased on what can be deduced here's our best guesstimate:\n\nTom Ford Sunnies - $199.78\n\nValentino Rockstud Pumps - $825.00\n\nHermes Scarf - $395.00 (assuming this is a 36 x 36-inch silk scarf)\n\nRoland Mouret Pants - $479.00 (these are on sale!)\n\n*Hermes Birkin Bag - $13,500.00 (*Though Linton did not tag the bag, it is easily recognizable as one of the world's most sought after status symbols.)\n\nSub Total: $15,398.78\n\n**Kentucky Sales Tax @ 6%: $923.93\n\nTotal: $16,322.71 (minus the cost of Linton's billowy white blouse)\n\n(**It is unclear where Linton purchased these items, but for the sake of an apples to apples comparison, let's assume she paid Kentucky state taxes.)\n\nThat is a hefty price tag for a trip outfit for most anyone at any income level but when put into the context of what it may signify for a Kentuckian earning minimum wage \u2014 $7.25 per hour \u2014 it is staggering.\n\nA person would have to work 2,251 hours and 24 minutes to make enough to pay for such an ensemble. Put another way, a person would have to work for 56 weeks straight, without any deductions for state or federal taxes, in order to come up with the money. Not to belabor the point, but put yet another way, that is an entire calendar year plus one month with zero money going toward any other expenses \u2013 food, clothing, rent, electricity, underwear, etc.\n\n(2) Have wife, will travel\n\nWhile it may seem unusual for Linton to travel with her husband on official government business, it is not unique. Obama Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and his wife, Stephanie, often traveled together. So much so, that she was pilloried for venturing off on shopping excursions in foreign cities while her husband attended to his duties.\n\nIn general, the cost of travel by elected officials and their families to taxpayers, including presidential travel, is a touchy subject. In fact, reports Monday revealed President Trump's almost-weekly trips to Trump Organization properties have put tremendous pressure on the Secret Service budget. In the first seven months of the new administration, hundreds of Secret Service agents have worked so many hours, they will soon hit their maximum pay provided by statute and not be eligible for more overtime.\n\nThe Obamas were also lambasted for their regular date nights in New York City.\n\nIn the case of the Mnuchins, the only thing that does appear out of the ordinary is that the couple was traveling on a government jet in the first place. The Washington Post reports, \"Treasury secretaries only fly government planes when they go on international trips. They usually fly on domestic carriers when they are traveling inside the country.\"\n\n(3) Where's the beef?\n\nLinton is no stranger to Internet controversy. A self-published memoir about her volunteer stint in Africa was widely denounced as a work of fiction on Twitter.\n\nThe book, entitled In Congo's Shadow: One Girl's Perilous Journey to the Heart of Africa, recounts the six months in 1999 when Linton, a white foreigner with \"long angel hair\" lived in Zambia allegedly hiding from rebel soldiers, during which she \"witnessed random acts of violence, contracted malaria and had close encounters with lions, elephants, crocodiles and snakes.\"\n\nAlmost as soon as it was published the book was panned by Zambian scholars and officials who lived in the area at the time Linton wrote about. Linton was blamed for perpetuating outdated clich\u00e9s about Africa while casting herself as a heroic \"white savior.\" It also inspired the hashtag \"#LintonLies.\"\n\n(4) I'm not Marie Antoinette, I just play her on TV\n\nFinally, Linton's self-aggrandizing, \"Let them eat cake\" tone made it easy for Instagram commenters to make Marie Antoinette references. Indeed, Miller, whose post sparked the Internet kerfuffle in the first place, told the New York Times, \"If she hadn't made her account private, I would have written back with a very snide Marie Antoinette joke.\"\n\nWell, it turns out Linton once played the last queen of France \u2014 who was eventually beheaded in the French Revolution \u2013 on CSI New York. Or at least, she played an actress playing her.\n\nHere's a clip:", "keywords": ["sparking", "secretarys", "linton", "white", "wife", "travel", "husband", "internet", "treasury", "furor", "post", "online", "apologizes", "trip", "taxes", "youre"], "polarity": 0.11126191048810095, "subjectivity": 0.5064796513010801},

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film 12 Years a Slave packs an emotional wallop. It's based on the memoir of a real person, Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. The movie depicts the brutality of the slave system by telling the story of a man who endured it.\n\nThe Race Card Project has seen an uptick in six-word submissions about slavery since the film's release \u2014 particularly from people who have grappled with their own family connections to slavery.\n\nProject curator Michele Norris and Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep both spoke with John Ridley, screenwriter of 12 Years a Slave (and an occasional commentator on Morning Edition), about what he hopes audiences will take away from the film.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the film has sparked very personal conversations about the nation's history of slavery\n\nWe have to remember, when Solomon wrote his memoir, at that time, this was a best-seller. It became a linchpin in the abolitionist cause. He toured, he spoke. And the story fell into obscurity. And we're having these conversations now, and what people are walking away from this film and this story with is that \u2014 and, by the way, I put myself ... at the head of this list \u2014 is how we really didn't have any concept of what slavery was all about.\n\nSo, I'm not surprised that many people would walk away from this film feeling like they need now to have a true concept or a true conversation about these kinds of things. I'm just sort of shocked that it's taken us this long to really try to excavate what slavery was all about.\n\nOn how he hopes the film will compel exchanges about slavery that aren't mired in guilt or anger\n\nI think what cannot get lost in this is where we've come as a country. And I think there has to be a sense of pride that we have come this far. There's got to be pride for the individuals whose families survived all of this. I think there's got to be pride for those individuals who [can say], \"If my family was like this, I am not.\" ...\n\nMy father was out here in California at [a school \"grandparents' day\"]. ... And a woman from Virginia came up to my dad ... and she said to him, \"Oh, your name is Ridley? ... I used to have family in Virginia named Ridley.\"\n\nAnd my dad just said very casually ... \"Oh, well, you know what, your family, they probably owned our family. They may have. I have family from Virginia.\" And the woman was not shocked, she was not taken aback. She goes, \"Oh, you know what? That's very possible.\" They started researching together, firing letters back and forth, looking to find out if that was true.\n\nI think it's very important for people to not go into it going, \"Oh, if my family did that 160 years ago, that's me.\" As opposed to, \"Why don't we find out what happened? Why don't we find out how we got to a point now where our kids or our grandkids are in the same school, enjoying the same privileges, that we are citizens in the same country and can actually talk about this as opposed to being afraid or horrified about what happened?\"\n\nWhat happened, happened; we can't change that. But we can change who we are in this moment. That's how you move on from this.\n\nOn how he was struck by Solomon Northup and his story\n\n[He was] a man who used every part of himself to survive \u2014 his wits, his guile, his physicality \u2014 but never gave into bitterness, never gave up his faith in other people and the system that completely let him down.\n\nI have two boys. I just said, if I were trying to show these two boys, my two sons, what I thought the character of a man was \u2014 of an American man, of a man of color \u2014 that's what Solomon was when I read this book. And my message was just about character.\n\nOn the importance of a scene in which a slave owner forces Solomon to beat a fellow slave\n\nMost importantly \u2014 and with almost everything that you'll see in the film \u2014 it was that way in the memoir. It was exceptionally important to me to hew as closely as possible to what was happening in the book.\n\nAnd also ... it speaks to the mindset of the slave owner ... played by Michael Fassbender. It would have been very easy ... going to a 2013 mindset, to simply say, \"Well, these individuals are all purely evil, and blacks across the board were just purely saints, and that was it.\" And that scene in particular really spoke to the multifaceted nature of that environment, and what it did to individuals across the board.", "keywords": ["think", "12", "slave", "slavery", "family", "film", "inspires", "solomon", "conversations", "thats", "man", "true"], "polarity": 0.08403604497354498, "subjectivity": 0.5293964947089946},

The music publishers that copyrighted the song in the 1960s settled the lawsuit on Friday.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn a few minutes, we'll meet one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. And that reminded us that, often, a movement becomes identified with a key word or phrase. In the civil rights era, that phrase was we shall overcome. Ironically, the song that gave rise to the phrase has become intertwined with prolonged litigation. But yesterday, a federal judge in New York signed an order that puts it into the public domain. Rick Karr reports.\n\nRICK KARR, BYLINE: A couple of music publishing companies claimed that they owned the copyright on a version of \"We Shall Overcome\" from 1963. It's credited to a group of writers, including the late Pete Seeger.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE SHALL OVERCOME\")\n\nPETE SEEGER: (Singing) We shall overcome.\n\nKARR: But even Seeger knew that the song predated his version.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSEEGER: It was known among the food and tobacco workers, mainly Negro union members. And I heard them singing it in 1947.\n\nKARR: Last year, musician and filmmaker Isaias Gamboa filed suit to strip the song of copyright. He based his claim on years of research for a documentary film about the song's history. The case was set to go to trial next month until Gamboa laid out his evidence in a deposition.\n\nISAIAS GAMBOA: One of the things that I opened with is there's only one truth. And somebody here is telling the truth and somebody isn't.\n\nKARR: Gamboa found lots of older versions of \"We Shall Overcome.\" The judge in the case had already stripped copyright from the song's first and most famous verse. After Gamboa's deposition, the music publishers backed down. Now that the song's in the public domain, Gamboa says, anyone can use it, like the dance student who contacted him last year.\n\nGAMBOA: He wanted to perform \"We Shall Overcome\" in a dance recital for his final. And his professor told him he could not do so unless he had a clearance from the people who were claiming the copyrights. And it broke his heart.\n\nKARR: Gamboa says he's not interested in damages, but the judge still has one decision to make - how much money the music publishers, who collected well over a million dollars in royalties from the copyright, owe attorney's fees and court costs. For NPR News, I'm Rick Karr.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE SHALL OVERCOME\")\n\nMAHALIA JACKSON: (Singing) We shall overcome, oh, Lord, one day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

I can smell the desert and the cigarette smoke through the phone.\n\n\"And I guess the answer is that it's not not because he's Native. You know?\"\n\nI do know.\n\nShe and I were raised by different tribes on reservations 3,000 miles apart. As children, though, we internalized the same directive: Find yourself a Native man. Good blood for your babies.\n\nI know how messed up it sounds. But it's about survival.\n\nIt's called blood quantum. Lots of Native nations, including my friend's, use it to determine who can and can't enroll as a citizen. But even in tribes like my own that use different enrollment policies, the notion that Indigeneity can be quantified \u2014 that it's our \"blood\" that makes us Native or not \u2014 is impossible to avoid.\n\nHere's how it works: Track down a tribal census document from the 1800s. Assume every person listed was a certified, \"full-blooded\" Indian and do the math from there. Choose an arbitrary fraction to serve as your citizenship cut-off. And if anyone's personal fraction happens to fall below that standard, they're out of luck. Traditional or not, blood quantum is the law of the land. You either buy in or you die out. Just another colonial reality we have little choice but to participate in.\n\nFor me, the hierarchy has always been clear\u2014if not Mashpee Wampanoag then Aquinnah or Herring Pond. If not Wampanoag then Narragansett. Then Pequot. And if you find yourself too far from home to lock down an Eastern Woodlands man to father your children, he damn well better be Indigenous to somewhere on this continent.\n\nFind yourself a Native man. Good blood for your babies. I know how messed up it sounds. But it's about survival.\n\nIncidentally, the man I love now looks uncannily like John Smith from the Disney Pocahontas movie. He is German. Maybe English. He's not sure how much of either, and no one ever asks. Sometimes he'll ask me, \"Is there any part of you that wants me to be different?\" What he means is, do I ever find myself wishing he were Native. Three years into our relationship, I'm still not sure how to answer.\n\nIt's odd to think about high school-aged me, on the lookout for an Indian baby daddy. Especially because, even now, I'm not sure if motherhood is something I want for myself. But at 14 and 15, I was meeting Native boys on the powwow circuit and running equations in my head. How much Indian \"blood\" did he have? What kind? Did his fraction plus mine equal legitimate tribal citizenship for our offspring? Would his brown skin and high cheekbones survive the wild labyrinth of our genes so that my babies might not have to fight to be seen as Indigenous?\n\nOn the phone, my friend tells me that her current beau checks most of these boxes. They've only been together for two months, but she's done the math. (1/4 + 5/8) \u00f7 2 = 7/16 and just like that, their babies will be Indian enough. The hard part is over. All that's left to do is fall in love and stay there.\n\nHere's the thing about blood quantum: it's not real. It has no basis in biology or genetics or any Indigenous tradition I'm aware of. It's a colonial invention designed to breed us out of existence. But it's got all these smart people\u2014traditionalists, university students, Indigenous language revitalists\u2014running around doing mental math, convinced it's our best shot at keeping our cultures alive.\n\nI won't pretend that I'm above it. The prospect of having kids even more mixed than I am makes me anxious. If, in a century, the Wampanoag tribe no longer exists\u2014if we lose our land, our traditions, our language\u2014will it be my fault? If my babies end up looking like him, if they feel more white than Wampanoag, have I wasted my ancestors' sacrifices?\n\nMy mom's five-year-old foster sons are blonde-haired and blue-eyed and right now they're learning to count in W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak. P\u00e2saq, nees, nuhsh, y\u00e2w, the words sound at home in their voices. \"Savannah,\" they asked me once, \"How come you're Wampanoag?\" And I said, \"How come you are?\" They considered the question for a moment, then one of them piped up, \"We're Wampanoag because our mom made us that way.\" I knew just what he meant because mine did, too.\n\nMy boyfriend also wants to learn the language. When we visit my mom, he points to labels placed around the house to help the kids build vocabulary and reads them aloud. Ushq\u00f4t, kunakuneek, wun\u00f4k, I repeat each word with the correct pronunciation and he tries again.\n\nI love him because he can gut a fish and make a friendship bracelet, because he's 6'3\" and he sings in the bathtub, because he asks for one French braid when he wants to look fancy and two when he needs cheering up. Do I want him to be different? God, no. But when I think about the future\u2014not just mine but my tribe's, all of Indian Country's\u2014I start to doubt myself.\n\nOne thing I know now that I didn't three years ago: If we have kids together someday, it won't be their blood that makes them Wampanoag.\n\nMost days I think I'm done doing mental math. No more worrying that I'm being selfish, that I'm letting colonialism do its job. But when the guilt and the self-suspicion creep up on me, he will be there. He'll tumble onto the couch, arms outstretched, waiting for me.

Jeff Flake wrote his new book Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle in secret, not even telling his closest political advisers about his plans until it was ready. And given the political test he'll face over the coming year, it isn't hard to see why.\n\nFlake is up for re-election in 2018, where he faces real threats from both the left and the right. His book is inspired by former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater's 1960 tome of the same name and is direct in its criticisms not just of President Trump, but toward other Republicans for, as Flake sees it, turning a blind eye and making a \"Faustian bargain\" when Trump abandoned many core conservative principles like free trade, and for his controversial stands, from birtherism to racial dog whistles.\n\nWhile the things he lays out in his book may well endear him to independents and even Democrats in Arizona, the radical way he takes on Trump without abandon certainly won't help him in his first test next year: a GOP primary where challengers \u2014 who are being egged on by the White House \u2014 are already circling.\n\nNear the end of the 2016 election, seeing major GOP figures criticize the party's nominee was nothing out of the ordinary. Many \u2014 including Flake \u2014 refused to vote for Trump and further craved distance after his vulgar 2005 Access Hollywood tape surfaced.\n\nBut come November, against all odds, Trump rode a populist wave to victory, giving Republicans control of the White House, Congress and selection of a new Supreme Court justice to boot.\n\nWith unified control of Washington, criticizing the new president suddenly waned in GOP circles. Now, as Trump continues to stumble after 200 days in office, Flake writes that their relative successes shouldn't matter: \"I write this book because we as conservatives \u2014 and conservatism itself \u2014 are in crisis.\"\n\nFlake admits that may seem like \"a preposterous claim,\" given that they control the government. \"But make no mistake, as a governing philosophy, conservatism is indeed in crisis \u2014 and not in spite of this apparent success but because of it,\" later blasting self-described conservatives for changing their political stripes \"depending on fashion or the passions of the day or based on how much applause a line in a speech received at a rally.\"\n\nTrump's theory to win in 2016 was to draw out white, working-class voters who hadn't shown up for Republicans in years, but he failed to broaden the electorate by targeting younger and more racially diverse voters as the GOP's 2012 autopsy recommended. Flake says that strategy was only a Band-Aid, giving in to the \"sugar high of populism, nativism, and demagoguery. The crash from this sugar high will be particularly unpleasant.\"\n\n\"We have given in to the politics of anger \u2014 the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate,\" Flake writes. \"These are the spasms of a dying party.\"\n\nFlake argues throughout that just because Republicans notched an unlikely win last November, they shouldn't take that as a mandate or a signal that the type of politics Trump and his disciples preach should become the conservative gospel.\n\nIn fact, he makes clear he believes many of their populist pitches are downright heretical. Trump spent the entire 2016 campaign assailing free trade, appealing to Rust Belt workers hit hard by declines in manufacturing jobs that he argued were the result of bad trade deals, but in reality were more of a result of technological advances. Abandoning a core economic principle of the conservative movement and the Republican Party for generations, when Trump got into office he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and soon his administration will begin renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nA good portion of the book is spent outlining why Flake believes free trade is so critical to a healthy U.S. economy and why it's been the backbone of conservative economics. He calls Trump flat-out wrong for opposing it and criticizes other Republicans for not pushing back more.\n\n\"Rather than fighting the populist wave that threatened to engulf us, rather than defending the enduring principles that were consonant with everything that we knew and had believed in, we pretended that the emperor wasn't naked,\" he writes. \"Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.\"\n\n\"Never has a party so quickly or easily abandoned its core principles as my party did in the course of the 2016 campaign....lurch[ing] like a tranquilized elephant from a broad consensus on economic philosophy and free trade that had held for generations to an incoherent and often untrue mash of back-of-the-envelope populist slogans. Seemingly overnight,\" Flake laments, blaming \"powerful nativist impulses that have arisen in the face of fear and insecurity over the swiftly evolving global economy.\"\n\nDecrying the \"nativist impulse\" in immigration policy\n\nFlake, a border state Republican, is also at odds with Trump \u2014 and many within his own party \u2014 on the issue of immigration.\n\n\"We have to return to the politics of comity and inclusion and reject the politics of xenophobia and demonization,\" writes the former member of the Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group that pushed a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013, only to see it die in the House.\n\nWe have given in to the politics of anger \u2014 the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate... These are the spasms of a dying party.\n\nFlake opens up about why he's so sympathetic to the plight of immigrants, and it's not just because of the large Hispanic population of the state he represents. There are humanizing elements and personal reflections throughout that give a glimpse into how his upbringing and faith have shaped his conservative worldview.\n\nThe son of a rancher who depended on migrant labor, Flake talks about how he got \"to know immigrants intimately and honestly. You learn through experience how indispensable they are to making things work in America.\" And the \"nativist impulse\" that crescendoed throughout 2016 is \"always destructive, always comes with a cost, and never ends well.\"\n\nAs a devout Mormon, Flake also recalled the plight of his own forefathers, recalling how in 1838 the Missouri governor signed an order saying that the religious group \"must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary.\" And he talks about how it was a group of Muslim immigrant doctors who saved his father-in-law's life after he suffered a massive heart attack.\n\n\"When we say 'No Muslims,' or 'No Mexicans,' we may as well say 'No Mormons,'\" Flake writes. \"Because it is no different.\"\n\nFlake immediately denounced Trump's proposed Muslim ban when he unveiled it on the campaign trail in December 2015, and even visited a mosque shortly after to show his support. For that action, he received a note of support and thanks from former President George W. Bush \u2014 who had visited a mosque in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to try to temper anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\nNow that he's president, Trump has tried to push through another ban on immigration from six, originally seven, Muslim-majority countries, which has been logjammed in the courts and will eventually be ruled on by the Supreme Court this fall. Flake concedes that any president does have broad latitude over national security matters, and likely the order was within Trump's rights, as he and his advisers have argued. But the Arizona senator rebuts that \"there is a world of difference between believing you can do something and that you should do something.\" There has been a marked decline in illegal border crossings under Trump and then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, now the president's new chief of staff.\n\n\"Other side\" is not the enemy\n\nFlake is also deeply troubled by the lines of demarcation drawn between parties, and how even helping or working with \u2014 or, heaven forbid, saying nice things about \u2014 someone from the dreaded \"other side\" is interpreted as partisan treason.\n\nIn one poignant anecdote, he recalls how he sat with his Arizona colleague, former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, as she attended the State of the Union one year after she was nearly assassinated during a constituent event. Still recovering from a debilitating brain injury, she wanted to stand to applaud President Barack Obama but couldn't do it on her own. So Flake helped her rise, leaving him as \"a lone Republican among cheering Democrats.\" That gesture prompted him to receive \"furious text messages and emails\" from constituents demanding to know why he \"agreed with President Obama.\"\n\nSimilarly, when he dared to send out a supportive tweet about Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine after he had been chosen as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate last year, calling him a \"good man and a good friend,\" Flake felt \"remarkable, unhinged fury from the ideologues\" in return. By that time, Flake had already made his concerns with Trump well-known, and the then-GOP nominee even told him when he came to Capitol Hill to meet with senators that Flake would lose his election in November; Flake wasn't up until the following cycle, however.\n\n\"I am a proud conservative and a lifelong Republican. That does not make the Democrats my enemies. America has too many real enemies to indulge such nonsense,\" Flake writes.\n\nFor Flake, that extends to the press as well, which Trump and his advisers have frequently branded the \"opposition party.\" He's deeply troubled by the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories \u2014 but not in the way Trump throws around the term to be a catch-all for any mainstream media story he dislikes. Calling it \"madness to turn ourselves inside out in an attempt to make reality comport with an alternate reality, just because someone in power would like us to,\" Flake says such attacks on the truth itself, and questioning what are facts in favor of \"alternative facts,\" are \"a threat to democracy\" and certainly not becoming of any conservative principles. It's something he's faced blowback for back home when he took the fact-based position that yes, Obama had been born in the U.S. He calls out Fox News and other conservative sites for continuing to promulgate the myth. He recalls being jeered at a Tea Party event when he said he did believe President Obama was a citizen, saying that \"to be booed because I didn't subscribe to a right-wing conspiracist fantasy about our first African American president is a sobering experience indeed.\"\n\n\"When a conspiracy theory becomes litmus-test orthodoxy, objective reality is at risk,\" Flake bemoans.\n\n2018 brings political challenges for Flake\n\nSomething else that could be at risk is Flake's own political future.\n\nTrump has reportedly talked about spending as much as $10 million to defeat Flake in a primary, and last week the White House wouldn't confirm or deny whether the president would support a challenger to Flake. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did say that Flake \"would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the president\" and zeroed in on \"passing legislation\" instead.\n\nBut Flake has, in fact, backed most of Trump's appointees and political agenda so far, even voting for the failed Senate GOP health care bill even as it was Arizona's other senator \u2014 another frequent Trump critic John McCain\u2014 whose \"no\" vote torpedoed it.\n\nAnd while Flake's 136-page manifesto pulls no punches, in some of the interviews he's done after the book came out he hasn't been as pugnacious in going after the president, as he was on NBC's Meet the Press this past weekend, perhaps denying ad-makers of damaging clips.\n\nFor now, though, Flake's marker against the president and those in his party he brands as conservative sellouts is the biggest indication yet of how Trump \u2014 part unwilling, part unable \u2014 has failed to unite the GOP, exposing the large fissures that still remain despite Republican sweeps last November. As Republicans head into 2018 and beyond, Flake says he is trying to save the party from themselves.\n\n\"This is not an act of apostasy.

She always knew her ancestors had once owned slaves, but had been told again and again, particularly by her Southern grandmother, that the family's slaves had been treated well.\n\n\"She was matter-of-fact that the family had owned slaves in the past,\" Byroade says, \"and emphasized that we did not come from 'plantation-type' families \u2014 that our slaves had been trusted house servants.\"\n\n\"At first this seemed OK to me because it was OK to her,\" Byroade continues. \"But eventually I understood that the domination of another person's free will was unacceptable.\"\n\nIn 1844, an 8-year-old girl was purchased at a slave auction. The girl, named Harriet, served as a maid to Byroade's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother.

He found Harriet's bill of sale and gave it to a library assistant named Todd Perry, one of Harriet's descendants.

There were plans to add a new category to the forms for people of Middle Eastern or North African descent. But the U.S. Census Bureau has decided against it. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports on the reaction.\n\nHANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Naseem Alkobadi left Yemen as a young girl with her family 15 years ago. And after they settled in New York City, she noticed that when you fill out an official form here in the U.S., there always seemed to be a question about race and ethnicity.\n\nNASEEM ALKOBADI: Everywhere - you can see it when you go to a doctor or schools. You always get this option.\n\nWANG: And Alkobadi says she wasn't sure which check box is for her.\n\nALKOBADI: Honestly, it was hard for me to pick. I was like, oh, my God. What should I put? Should I put Asian or...\n\nWANG: Other? Alkobadi says because Yemen is on the continent of Asia, she settled on Asian. And when she can on forms, she writes in Arab. But she says on the 2020 census, she would've liked to mark a box for Middle Eastern or North African.\n\nALKOBADI: It should be there because they had many nationalities. So why is it not there? It's unbelievable.\n\nWANG: Mohammad Barakat is disappointed by the Census Bureau's decision, too. He works at the Arab American Family Support Center based in Brooklyn and remembers grappling with the race question as a first-grader.\n\nMOHAMMAD BARAKAT: My parents came here from Palestine. They didn't really know English. And so whenever there was paperwork, I had to do it.\n\nWANG: And on one of those forms...\n\nBARAKAT: I remember seeing white, and then in parentheses, anyone from the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nWANG: Which are the regions, along with Europe, that the U.S. government defines as white. But Barakat got was perplexed. He went to school and asked his teacher if he could answer Asian.\n\nBARAKAT: And she's like, well, if you want to put Asian, go ahead. But I think you should put white. And so I went around, asking other teachers. And they all said you're white. You're white. I'm like, but look at me.\n\nWANG: Barakat says he doesn't look white, and he's culturally not white. But, sometimes, he marks white if he sees the Middle East and North Africa listed next to it. Or he looks for a box for other, so he can write in Arab. This makeshift way of answering surveys means that information about people with roots in the Middle East or North Africa is often hidden within data about other groups.\n\nMAYA BERRY: The fight right now is to say the category should be there because it will arrive at a better count.\n\nWANG: Maya Berry is the executive director of the Arab American Institute, which is trying to get support in Congress to overturn the Census Bureau's decision. But she admits the timing of this push is not ideal. Following President Trump's travel bans against countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen, many in the Middle Eastern and North African communities in the U.S. worry about giving the federal government more personal information.\n\nBERRY: That's the burden that our communities had to bear - trying to make a determination about - do you advocate for the inclusion of a category or not?\n\nWANG: Berry says getting a Middle Eastern or North African check box onto the census is one fight.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThe wrenching film 12 Years a Slave, based on true events, re-creates the story of a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. The Golden Globe-winning film has prompted an uptick in six-word entries concerning slavery sent to the Race Card Project, particularly from people who have tried to uncover their own family connections to slavery.\n\nFor many of those people, like Robert Goins of San Francisco, the search can be difficult \u2014 and the discoveries painful.\n\nGoins was researching his ancestors in North Carolina a decade ago when he stumbled upon grief while going through a ledger on microfiche \u2014 hence, his six-word submission: \"Found my ancestors and grief too.\"\n\n\"I found my great-grandfather's family and some notes held at the North Carolina archives,\" Goins tells Norris. \"The family lived in Belews Creek \u2014 and Sauratown.\" Sauratown, Goins notes, sounds like \"sorrow.\"\n\nIn his search, Goins found a ledger containing the name of the overseer of the plantation where the family members were enslaved, he explains. \"When I first read it, it looked like 'Grief.' I actually think the overseer's name was 'Greif,' but I could not help but see it as Grief,\" Goins says.\n\n\"Grief is here. Grief will not let me go any further until I acknowledge it. Finding grief stopped me in my tracks,\" he adds.\n\nEven 10 years later, the discovery still affects him, Goins says. He vividly recalls rolling his fingers across the microfiche image and seeing his ancestors listed among livestock and farm implements. He says he felt like a swimmer who needed to find air.\n\nTo get his head back above water, Goins kept digging. He needed to find some stories, he says, \"that were not as difficult to handle. ... I needed stories where [my ancestors] were ... autonomous, they were doing things, they were living, they had children, you could see their movement. They weren't put on a place and [told], 'You had to stay here.' \"\n\nSo Goins dug into another branch of the family, he says. And he found a very different document in \"The Order Book,\" held at the Albemarle County Courthouse in Charlottesville, Va. The book, Norris explains, was akin to a government census used to keep track of free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nGoins found a reference there to his great-great-great-grandfather, Michael Goings, who was born in 1805 or 1806 in Albemarle County, Va., and lived as a freeman.\n\nRobert Goins' great-great-great-grandfather was noted in a 19th century Order Book, used to track free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Robert Goins Courtesy of Robert Goins\n\n\"He was a coal miner, he was a coal hauler. He lived to be 80. He moved from Ohio to Michigan during the runup to the Civil War and moved back to Ohio after the Civil War,\" Goins explains. \"His wife died a few months before he did.\"\n\nDiscovering an ancestor who was born in a state where 90 percent of black people were enslaved \u2014 and who nevertheless managed to obtain his freedom \u2014 meant everything to Goins, Norris explains. \"The fact that he worked and earned wages \u2014 that finally made him feel like his head was above water,\" she says.\n\nAs Goins describes it, \"I felt grounded. I felt like, 'Wow, why didn't I know this all of my life?' This is what I needed. I needed this to help me in difficult times. I needed to hear that they survived and that I could survive as well.\"\n\nNevertheless, Goins still feels burdened by his discovery. The history he has uncovered is still difficult to talk about, he says, even with members of his own family.

Research by the Census Bureau shows these revisions could improve the accuracy of the upcoming national headcount in 2020. Any changes would carry wide implications for legislative redistricting, civil rights laws and health statistics.\n\nSo far, though, the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which sets the standards for race and ethnicity data for federal agencies, has not released any decisions. OMB has also not responded to NPR's request for comment.\n\nStill, on Friday, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, announced the upcoming national headcount will keep the same racial and ethnic categories used for the 2010 census. It will also continue asking about those topics as two questions, despite its own research showing that changes could encourage more census participants to provide race and ethnicity data.\n\nAt the bureau's public meeting on 2020 census preparations, the chief of the bureau's population division, Karen Battle, said that a new category for people with roots in the Middle East or North Africa, or MENA, will not be added to the 2020 questionnaire because more research is needed. Battle cited public comments the bureau has received saying that MENA should be treated not as an option for race but for ethnicity, which she says the bureau has not specifically tested so far.\n\nBefore the announcement, census watchers said Census Bureau documents posted this week on the website for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB provided a signal of where the Trump administration stands on these proposals.\n\n\"I think this is a big one,\" said John Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau who left the agency last year, referring to the significance of the documents.\n\nThey detail the bureau's request to change the questionnaire set to be used in an upcoming practice run of the 2020 census \u2014 known as the End-to-End Census Test \u2014 taking place this year in Rhode Island's Providence County.\n\nTo prepare for potential policy changes on race and ethnicity data, that questionnaire, as submitted to OMB last year for approval, originally followed the Obama-era proposals. It combined the two census questions about race and Hispanic origin required by the current federal standards into one question, with \"Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish\" as an option for both race and ethnicity. Among the other checkboxes under the combined question was \"Middle Eastern or North African,\" which was separate from \"White.\"\n\nBut the Census Bureau has now submitted a request to go back to two separate questions with no checkbox for \"Middle Eastern or North African.\"\n\n\"In order to ensure that the systems fielded in the 2018 End-to-End Census Test are consistent with the design for the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau made the decision to redesign the systems supporting data collection in this test to be consistent with the two-question format,\" the Census Bureau wrote in its request.\n\nThompson, the former Census Bureau director, considers the request a sign that the bureau has gotten word that OMB will not change the federal standards on race and ethnicity data.\n\nIf that is indeed the case, Thompson said lawmakers on Capitol Hill could step in later to proceed with the proposed changes before the 2020 census.\n\n\"Anything can happen,\" he said. \"Congress can pass a law.\"\n\nOther census watchers say they're disappointed that the Trump administration appears to have decided to not follow the recommendations of Census Bureau staffers who spent years researching how to collect more accurate race and ethnicity data.\n\n\"The decision to ignore years of research and the expert advice of scientists is a blow to science and the collection of the best data possible,\" said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, in a written statement.\n\nLast year, an advisory group of experts from various federal agencies released a report that pointed to concerns about how the proposed changes to the federal standards could affect state governments, schools and hospitals that may or may not use the standards for their own record keeping.\n\nNational The Rash Of Troubles At The Census Bureau The Rash Of Troubles At The Census Bureau Listen \u00b7 3:53 3:53\n\n\"Inconsistency between self-reported [federal] survey information and reporting on administrative records results in discrepancies between major sources of information for the [nation], which could be made worse by changing the standards,\" wrote the advisers serving on the Federal Interagency Working Group for Research on Race and Ethnicity.\n\nKen Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director who served under the Clinton administration, says he acknowledges that nobody wants to change any form if it can be avoided.\n\n\"But a country with demographics as fluid as the U.S. has to adjust its statistics,\" adds Prewitt, who is also author of What Is \"Your\" Race?: The Census and Our Flawed Efforts to Classify Americans.\n\nPrewitt says the proposal to ask about race and ethnicity in a combined question is a \"really innovative\" way to address the challenge of \"some other race\" ranking as the third-largest racial group reported in census results from 2000 and 2010. If the Trump administration does not move the proposal forward, Prewitt expects it to be reintroduced for approval under a different presidential administration.\n\nWhile the wait continues for an official announcement of OMB's decision on the proposals, the Census Bureau is expected to release its report to Congress on the final wording of the 2020 census questions \u2014 including those about race and ethnicity \u2014 by the end of March.", "keywords": ["categories", "racial", "ethnic", "bureau", "ethnicity", "federal", "census", "race", "standards", "questions", "changes", "research", "used", "2020", "2010"], "polarity": 0.07693381180223285, "subjectivity": 0.3460659223817118},

Really, who knew they cared so much?\n\nThe qualifiers for the president's claims around black joblessness are pretty significant; indeed, they're actually the whole story. Most of the improvement in the jobs figures are part of an ongoing trend that can be attributed to the Fed's management of the economy under Janet Yellen, whom President Trump declined to renominate to run the nation's central bank. And while the black employment numbers were historically low, at the time of Trump's speech, the most recent jobs data put black unemployment at 6.8 percent. If those numbers were the overall national figures, the country would be in or near a recession. Consider that for as far back as the data goes, black unemployment has consistently been around twice the rate of joblessness for white people, in strong economies or sluggish ones. If the broader economy is on solid footing, black unemployment numbers is high. When the nation is a downturn, black employment figures teeter on the catastrophic.\n\nEven the relatively low black unemployment numbers that Trump touted in his State of the Union speech couldn't hold; by the end of the week, new jobs figures showed that black unemployment actually spiked nearly a full point to 7.7 percent. And if black unemployment is never that low, white unemployment is almost never that high, with a notable recent exception of a sustained fallow period between 2009 and 2011 during the Great Recession. (In January, white unemployment fell to 3.3 percent.) Taken together, the January numbers are another example of the precarity of the black economic condition and the extent to which racial disparities in joblessness have calcified into a permanent, structural feature of American life.\n\n\"[Politicians] using improvement in the numbers to ignore the disparities, but there's almost no celebration to be had,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Privacy program at the Brookings Institute. He said that black people were \"the sacrificial lambs for full employment,\" as a desire for aggressive interventions to lower joblessness tends to dry up when the economy is doing better, even as black people are still struggling. And it means that the kinds of policy decisions that get made when the economy is robust \u2014 say, raising interest rates \u2014 might be good for banks but make it even harder for black borrowers with less family wealth and lower incomes to get loans for homes and businesses. \"[Lawmakers] have not demonstrated the stomach to really invest in ways to create inclusive economies,\" Perry said. \"It's still federal investment, but in a gated community kind of way.\"\n\nAnd yes, a major part of understanding the employment gap means understanding discrimination, which as we've written before, is a knowable, quantifiable component of the labor market. Even when you control for education, black folks are less likely to be employed and have lower starting salaries than similarly situated white people. When the economy is more robust, that racial gap in employment does shrink, because there's more competition among employers for workers; which is to say that it becomes more costly for employers to discriminate than when jobs are more scarce. But that gap in employment remains, and the gains we do see in black employment tend to be clustered in lower-paying sectors like retail or the gig economy.\n\nThere are rural, white communities where unemployment numbers looks like black unemployment numbers, but their employment prospects, too, tend to also be obscured by federal jobs numbers. Conversely, there are communities across the country where black employment and wages actually outpace national averages \u2014 they tend to be places that have large, black middle classes due to their proximity to federal jobs, universities, military bases, and the steady private investment that flows around those institutions. Perry said those regions could serve as a template for how to reduce the racial jobs gap \u2014 lawmakers in Washington could direct funding and investment to bolster those anchor institutions, while investing in the kind of infrastructure jobs that create jobs and transferable job skills for communities where people are consistently out of work for long stretches of time.\n\nWhich brings us back to President Trump. He's never never really explained which specific policies he's championed or enacted that would have lowered the low (but still really high) black unemployment rate for which he's claimed credit. And of course, that's not really the point of him invoking any of this: his boast and Republicans' rapturous applause to it was a way to ding the Democrats (and Trump's black predecessor) for their supposed inaction toward alleviating the plight of black people.

In fact, she wishes she had spent more time in the kitchen with her mother, learning the family dishes.\n\nShe credits a course she took in college, Filipino American Contemporary Issues, for her change in perspective. \"That dinky little class, that I thought would be nothing ... changed my life and my connection to identity,\" Ramil says.\n\nToday, Ramil's extended family is made up of more than 100 people. Many of her cousins have married non-Filipinos. And now it's Ramil \u2014 who once rejected rice \u2014 who's trying to keep her family's food traditions alive.\n\nShe started with lumpia, which she describes \"as an eggroll, but better.\" Her grandmother, Fausta Reyes Ramil, who lived to be 100, taught Ramil how to make the fried rolls, filled with pork and finely chopped vegetables, before she passed away. (Ramil also has a blog with her grandmother's journal entries, called Lola's Journals.)\n\nNow, Ramil is making sure the young people in her family know how to make the traditional dish.\n\n\"I would prepare my grandmother's lumpia recipe and kind of set up a lumpia sweatshop, if you will,\" Ramil says. \"For each of my cousins' children ... there are about 25 or 30 of them \u2014 I would put a place mat in front of them, lumpia wrappers ... a little bowl of raw meat.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\n\"It's a really neat time, because while they're rolling, I'll bring in my older cousins, my aunts and uncles, and all of them \u2014 they just love it,\" she says. \"We just all talk about stories of my grandmother cooking, our family. ... I just love the tradition.\"\n\nThe irony of being the champion of her family's culinary traditions isn't lost on Ramil. And while her mother didn't resist her request for Pasta Roni all those years ago, Ramil hopes that she'll handle a similar request differently.\n\n\"One day, if I'm a mom, and I hear my daughter say that, I might push back a little \u2014 and I hope I do.\"\n\nDo you have a family food tradition you're trying to preserve?

Others think more abstractly \u2014 they hear racist and think of policies, institutions, laws and language.\n\nAs journalists, we're constantly trying to balance the different uses of the term in a way that will make sense to all of our listeners and readers. But in the era of proposed border walls and Muslim bans and \"shithole countries\" and \"hell in the inner cities,\" it's getting harder and harder, as one of our listeners put it, not to \"call a racist spade a racist spade.\"\n\nOn this week's Code Switch podcast episode, we spoke with NPR's standards and practices editor Mark Memmott about when it's appropriate to call something racist. We also interviewed Phillip Atiba Goff, who helps police departments across the country confront racism. You can listen to their takes here.\n\nAnd then we started to get your takes. In less than 24 hours, we got dozens of emails. Here are excerpts from some of the ones that got us thinking:\n\nKelli Stowe, in Winston-Salem, N.C., says she was \"dumbfounded\" by the idea that many journalists are hesitant to use the word racist:\n\n\"In today's society, we always hear about how people (liberals, to be more specific) are too sensitive. We hear about how people can't say anything without someone taking offense to it, and how this world is now too 'PC'. ... I say all of that to say how ironic it is that calling someone (or their words/actions) racist is somehow unacceptable. As a black woman, I am often faced with words and coded language that is stereotypical, racist and just plain insensitive.\"\n\nIsaiah Johnson in Cambridge, Mass., says he uses the word racism to refer to the \"history and social structures surrounding race,\" not to defame someone's character. But many of his peers don't agree:\n\n\"Even with an explanatory comma, I almost always get responses like, 'Well I just don't define racism that way.' Even when I push for why that's a more useful definition, I'm still met with, 'But I don't feel that that's how it's generally defined.' How do I get around that?\"\n\nSandy Nichols Thiam, who lives in Barcelona, Spain, said that, instead of scrambling to call individuals racist, journalists need to go further to put news and information into context:\n\n\"A huge part of [President Trump's] power is his ability to make us all jump. He uses outrageous inflammatory words and we all spend two weeks repeating them, only slightly secretly delighted to be swearing in public. What else is going on? Why does Haiti face the challenges that it does? Gosh ... does U.S. policy have anything to do with that?\"\n\nSome listeners were worried about overusing the word. Pete Connolly of Washington, D.C., says he supports calling things racist, but wonders where to draw the line:\n\n\"It strikes me that most of our world, and certainly the United States, is racist in one way or another. Should we go through the days just proclaiming 'that's racist' to everything? I'd probably be okay with that, but I think there is a lot of power in that word, and that power has value. Using it too much may make some people feel too comfortable in their racism.\"\n\nOthers leaned more toward the importance of normalizing the term. Amy Wagoner, in Philadelphia, shared her strategy:\n\n\"We know that racism is all around us and we are all swimming in it. I am a teacher and in my school when we are trying to approach these tough conversations, we sometimes say things like 'your racism is showing' which is just a friendlier way of acknowledging that we all have it, because our culture has it so deeply embedded. None of us is free of the task of examining our assumptions, many of which turn out to have racist roots.\"\n\nDan Miller in Catonsville, Md., says we need to be clear about saying what we mean:\n\n\"I am annoyed when I hear the term 'racially charged.' It's putting an unnecessary burden on listeners to make us substitute the word 'racist' into the place of 'racially charged,' because what else could that phrase mean? Obviously it just means racist. So just say that.\"\n\nNehemiah Legiste in Brooklyn says we also need to be clear about who journalists are serving when they avoid the word:\n\n\"We are terrified to use the word racist because we think we'll lose white people in that conversation. That in and of itself should let us know how we cower to white supremacy. I am a 28 year old black man, and the only people I know who shudder at the word racist are white folks. It's important to say that as we move forward because if we don't, we play this 'both sideism' in that it portrays reluctance to use the word 'racist' as something across all spectrums when, it's really to genuflect to white people.\"\n\nGot more thoughts about when to call something racist?

How?\n\nTo mark Black History Month, Penguin Classics is reprinting six early 20th century books by African-American writers. The five Harlem Renaissance novels, along with W.E.B Du Bois' 1903 masterwork, The Souls of Black Folk, are much more than a summons to reader-ly duty. Rather, they're a shake up and wake up call, reminding readers of the vigorous voices of earlier African-American writers, each of whom had their own ingenious take on \"the race problem\" and identity politics.\n\nWith a respectful nod, I'm going to bypass Du Bois' monumental essay collection, along with Harlem Renaissance superstars Claude McKay and Langston Hughes, in favor of three remaining revelatory novels by somewhat less celebrated writers.\n\nNella Larsen, the only female writer featured, makes the cut with her 1929 novel Passing. It's a page-turner premised on an idea that's discussed a lot these days: the idea of race as \"performance.\"\n\nLarsen's two main characters are upper-middle-class black women who knew each other back in the day and have been thrown together again by fate. Both women are light skinned, but one of them, Clare Kendry, has chosen to climb up the class ladder by passing as white.\n\nAt one point, Clare's clueless white husband says in conversation about black people: \"I don't dislike them, I hate them.\" Of course, the joke there is that he makes that boast while talking with two black women, one of whom is his wife.\n\nIn her sharp introduction to this edition of Passing, scholar Emily Bernard illuminates Larsen's own experience with the color line: Larsen was the daughter of a Danish mother and a West-Indian father. Passing is undeniably melodramatic, but it's infused with a sly humor and nervous awareness that Clare's daily act of \"performing whiteness\" will inevitably take a devastating toll.\n\nPassing is not an option for Wallace Thurman's heroine in The Blacker the Berry...: Emma Lou Morgan is so dark she thinks of herself as \"dipped, as it were, in indigo ink.\"\n\nThe Blacker the Berry... stirred up a hullabaloo when it came out in 1929 because it was the first novel to focus its plot on race prejudice or \"colorism\" among African-Americans.\n\nAlways hoping to find a more inclusive racial community, Emma Lou takes off to Los Angeles for college and then on to New York and Harlem. But everywhere she goes, lighter-skinned black women \u2014 the so-called \"blue veins\" \u2014 get exclusive access to the desirable sororities, jobs and potential husbands.\n\nThurman, whose literary career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis at 32, creates a complicated character in Emma Lou. By the time she arrives in Harlem, Emma Lou has realized her dark skin makes marriage unlikely, so she does something startling: She enjoys a series of sexual relationships without commitment or shame.\n\nApart from the vibrant character of Emma Lou, Thurman's novel presents some of the most layered portrayals of New York City life I've ever come across, from seedy employment agency waiting rooms to swank Harlem hot spots.\n\nThe dedication page of George S. Schuyler's extraordinary 1931 work of speculative fiction, Black No More, lets readers know that this is going to be a wild ride. Schuyler, who was black, writes:\n\nThis book is dedicated to all Caucasians in the great republic who can trace their ancestry back ten generations and confidently assert that there are no Black leaves, twigs, limbs, or branches on their family trees.\n\nBlack No More is a satiric tour de force that rips into myths of white supremacy, black nationalism and the American Dream. The story follows a black man named Max Disher as he gambles on a new invention, the Black-Off machine, that turns black folks white. Here's a jubilant Max after the procedure:\n\nGone were the slightly full lips and Ethiopian nose. Gone was the nappy hair. ... He was free! The world was his oyster and he had the open sesame of a pork-colored skin!\n\nSchuyler's own story is also the stuff of wild fiction: A fierce provocateur, he ended his life a member of the conservative John Birch Society.\n\nAll of these Harlem Renaissance novelists forge their art within what Du Bois famously called (in The Souls of Black Folk) the \"double-consciousness\" of African-Americans. That is, to be \"an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\"\n\nThese writers transform an understanding of the double-consciousness with the expression of a third consciousness they own \u2014 as stirring, singular artists controlling their narrative and projecting it into a cacophonous world.", "keywords": ["black", "deliver", "novels", "white", "harlem", "souls", "passing", "race", "lou", "women", "ingenious", "renaissance", "emma", "writers"], "polarity": 0.05289432789432791, "subjectivity": 0.4942987567987566},

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\nNational Geographic\n\n\"No, really, where are you from?\"\n\nThose questions about identity and appearance come up again and again in submissions to The Race Card Project. In some cases, Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep, people say it feels accusatory \u2014 like, 'Do you really belong?'\n\nIt's also a question that Alex Sugiura, because of his racially ambiguous appearance, can't seem to escape.\n\nSugiura, 27, is the child of a first-generation Japanese immigrant father and a Jewish mother of Eastern European descent. Sugiura's brother Max looks more identifiably Asian, but when people meet Alex, they're often not satisfied to hear that he's from Brooklyn.\n\nSome people find this question accusatory, as if the person being asked doesn't quite belong. But Sugiura actually welcomes the question and the conversations that flow out of it \u2014 and he says he understands why people ask.\n\n\"I have always thought I've had a particularly strange face,\" he explains. \"I looked at my parents growing up and I didn't see their faces in my face \u2014 I did see some combination, some mixture.\" When he looked in the mirror, he says, he didn't see a \"typical American face.\"\n\nThat may be so, but Sugiura's face, along with his brother Max and other adults and children of mixed race, was recently highlighted in the October issue of National Geographic. \"The Changing Face of America\" examines the nation's growing number of multiracial people and how they choose to identify themselves.\n\nWhen Sugiura fills out question about race in the census form, he checks the box for Japanese. But in more casual situations, he self-identifies as American but says he's ethnically Jewish.\n\nAlex Sugiura considers the fluidity of racial and ethnic identity 3:57\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Schoeller/National Geographic Martin Schoeller/National Geographic\n\nBut for as long as Sugiura can remember, he's been confused with someone of Latin American descent. It first happened when he was 6 or 7 years old, when someone began asking him questions in Spanish. \"And at that point, I had no faculty for the language and almost started crying cause I was just so terrified,\" he says.\n\nBut by age 11 he started to take Spanish classes. And while he'd already been taking Japanese language and cultural classes for years, he found he enjoyed Spanish much more.\n\n\"It was a passing fancy at first, this idea [that] by people jokingly or mistakenly identifying me as Hispanic. ... I thought there was some kind of safe space there, you might say \u2014 that I was given a kind of fictional persona,\" Sugiura says. \"I would say it propelled me forward and I feel very much like my own man through the Spanish language.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of the Sugiura Family\n\nThere's another interesting wrinkle in Sugiura's thoughts on the intersection of race and appearance, Norris says, noting that this particularly sensitive subject was a bit tough for Sugiura to talk about. \"He says that his height, his deep voice, his Type A personality, his sort of, big physical presence, has helped him sidestep ... some of the more painful, offensive stereotypes that are too often attached to Asian men.\"\n\nSugiura bristles at those stereotypes, and yet, he notes that his father \"did us a great favor by marrying our mother. ... They made two tall, loud boys.\"\n\n\"When you're a typical, you know, shorter, soft-spoken Asian male, you are perceived almost to be weaker or lacking the fiber of what an American leader is supposed to be,\" he says.\n\nThe Sugiura family's appearance raises questions in the American South 1:46\n\nSugiura says this all goes back to the reason that he welcomes this question, \"Where are you really from?\" He sees that question as an opening to make the point that there are many different ways to be Asian, Jewish, white or even a New Yorker. \"And he has a chance to make that point,\" Norris explains, \"if he actually gets to participate in those conversations.\"\n\nAnd, Sugiura notes, this question about where you come from can lead to some very unexpected conversations \u2014 like one his family experienced on a stop at a gas station in the American South. An older white man behind the counter asked his father, \"Where are you from, boy?\"\n\nAnd while the question felt laden with tension, the outcome of the encounter surprised everyone.

Until last month when the \"bomb cyclone\" blasted an unusually cold northern wind through the region that blew out 2 1/2 feet of water and left the ship exposed.\n\nThat was the break Ben Raines, a coastal and environmental reporter for AL.com had been waiting for.\n\nRaines believes the charred remains of the shipwreck he discovered are likely those of the Clotilda, the last American vessel to illegally bring African slaves to the U.S. nearly 160 years ago.\n\nReporter Ben Raines believes he's discovered what may be the last American slave ship. Al.com YouTube\n\nRaines told NPR Wednesday that seeing the remnants of the schooner breaking through the river was thrilling.\n\n\"It was actually breathtaking and I thought, 'This might be it!'\" he said.\n\nHe described his initial view of the site: \"With the tides more than 2 feet lower than normal, I saw this big sort of dinosaur backbone almost, arcing up out of the mud along the shoreline.\"\n\nAlthough he's not certain that it is the Clotilda, he says he has \"a really good hunch\" about it.\n\nBefore heading out to the site, Raines compiled months of research, collecting information from historical records, articles and notes from the captain's account of the trip. He interviewed locals with century-old ties to the region. Until he stumbled on one who told him he might know its location. So Raines set out to find it.\n\n\"It was old, it was burned, it was right where the guy said [the captain] burned it and it was where this local old-timer said it was,\" Raines said.\n\nThe Clotilda, which was retrofitted from a former timber cargo ship into an illicit human trafficking vessel, carried 110 African slaves from what is now the west African nation of Benin into Mobile Bay in about 1860. But shortly after delivering the captives to nearby plantations, the captain of the 86-foot schooner steered it to a secluded spot and set it on fire, in an attempt to destroy any evidence of the illegal voyage, according to Raines.\n\nGreg Cook, a marine archaeologist who explored the site with Raines, said there is no definitive evidence it is the same ship, but there is plenty to indicate that it is from the correct time period and that it may have once been used to transport timber.\n\nLike the infamous slave ship, this one also had two masts. \"Then you look at how the ship was rigged\" with \"iron fasteners that are commonly found in lumber trade schooners\" and that's another connection, Cook said. Additionally, \"based on what we know of the width or the beam of the ship, it's spot-on with the measurements that we had.\"\n\nCook said, rather than seeking proof that the buried ship is the Clotilda, he and his colleague John Bratten, were more intent on finding evidence that would rule it out as a possible candidate.\n\n\"We were looking for anything that could clearly tell us it was not the Clotilda and we didn't see anything that was exposed that would tell us it's not that ship,\" he explained.\n\nJoycelyn Davis said news of the possible discovery of the ship has triggered a wave of complicated emotions for her and her family. Davis, 41, is a sixth generation descendant of the people who were transported on the ship, who are now referred to as the Clotilda Africans.\n\n\"It's overwhelming,\" she said. \"To think of those 110 plus people that were taken away from their home, across the ocean to America. ... It makes me sad.\"\n\nThe slave trade was outlawed during the administration of President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 \u2014 53 years before the Clotilda touched American soil \u2014 though slavery remained legal until after the Civil War with the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865. And it was on a bet that the ship's owner, Timothy Meaher, hired Capt. William Forster to smuggle a shipment of slaves into the South. Meaher, a wealthy and respected businessman was an ardent proponent of slavery and was convinced he could slip a cargo ship past port officials without any repercussions.\n\nIt worked, although historian Sylviane Diouf said in her book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama: The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Story of the Last Africans Brought to America, the journey included an attempted mutiny by the crew.\n\n\"To know that it was all because of a bet. ... That kind of sucks,\" Davis said.\n\nThose who survived the treacherous voyage were surreptitiously put to work on plantations in the Mobile area shortly before the Civil War broke out.\n\nFollowing the war, Diouff writes, the freed men and women tried to get first Meaher then the government to arrange their return to their home in Africa but both refused. Instead, Meaher sold them land on which they established a community still known as Africatown, three miles north of downtown Mobile.\n\nDiouf writes:\n\n\"They ruled it according to their customary laws, continued to speak their own languages-which they taught their children- and insisted that writers use their African names so that their families would know that they were still alive. \"Cudjo Lewis, the last survivor of the Clotilda died in 1935.\"\n\nHistorian Henry Louis Gates Jr. says their descendants, including Davis, are the only group of African Americans who can trace their history to the actual slave ship that carried them to the U.S. as well as their ancestral home in Africa.\n\nDavis said, if it is the ship, she would like to see it preserved in a museum. She would also like the Meaher family, who remain prominent in Mobile, to come forward with their own history.\n\n\"After all, it is their ship,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't want anything from them but I do want to hear the history of their family. To have them tell it,\" she added.\n\nRaines says throughout history, plantation owners have made attempts to pretend the Clotilda incident never happened. \"So finding the ship and being able to tie it to [the descendants'] experience, could be a very powerful thing and go a long way toward healing those wounds.\"\n\nIn an episode of Finding Your Roots, a program that explores celebrity genealogies, famed hip hop drummer Questlove found out he is a descendant of the slaves brought over on the Clotilda.\n\nFamed hip hop drummer Questlove finds out he is a descendant of the Clotilda Africans. Finding Your Roots YouTube\n\nBratten and Cook, who also lead archaeological expeditions through the University of West Florida, figure it will take more than a year to move ahead with a full scale excavation of the ship, most of which is still buried in mud. They will need permits from the Alabama Historical Commission.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the agency said:\n\n\"[It] is our agency's duty to uphold the state law that manages and protects shipwrecks and archaeological sites in Alabama waters. After receiving the necessary permits and the development of a research design, the UWF maritime archaeology department can examine whether the vessel is, in fact, the Clotilda. However, such an endeavor requires both funding and planning so any question will take time to resolve.\n\nBut even then, Bratten said, \"We still have to get lucky.\"\n\nIt is possible that all traces of the slave-capturing voyage have been erased by the fire, time and the elements.", "keywords": ["raines", "vessel", "finding", "clotilda", "slave", "meaher", "african", "know", "reporter", "american", "slaves", "discovered", "ship"], "polarity": 0.06297023809523809, "subjectivity": 0.41642857142857137},

The logo is revered by some fans and considered offensive by many others.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nMajor League Baseball is phasing out a controversial logo. For years, the Cleveland Indians have used a cartoon mascot known as Chief Wahoo. Protesters have called for the team to scrap it. This was a demonstration filmed last year by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: One hundred years-plus - change the name of your baseball team, and change the logo.\n\nGREENE: Now, the team will still be known as the Indians, but next year, no Chief Wahoo. From WCPN ideastream, David C. Barnett reports.\n\nDAVID C. BARNETT, BYLINE: The image in question depicts a big-toothed, grinning caricature of a Native American. The Cleveland Indians have sported it since the 1940s. Standing at the bar of the Wild Eagle Saloon in downtown Cleveland, Cody Kinn says Chief Wahoo has always been a part of his life.\n\nCODY KINN: I grew up drawing him an art class. I mean, there's much more worse mascots out there. I mean, you got the Redskins. Their mascot's way worse than Chief Wahoo.\n\nBARNETT: The Washington Redskins have also seen protests, as have the Atlanta Braves. At the nearby Winking Lizard saloon, Benita Meiser thinks there is nothing wrong with the Cleveland logo. She proudly wears her Wahoo earrings, jackets, and T-shirts without a second thought.\n\nBENITA MEISER: It was just - always been our symbol, just like bears, cats, dogs, anything else. I never really took it any other way.\n\nBARNETT: But many did. They found it offensive and racist. Protesters have regularly boycotted Chief Wahoo on opening day. Cleveland.com sportswriter Bud Shaw says he's come out against the logo ever since 1991.\n\nBUD SHAW: People swear that they don't feel it's inappropriate or tone-deaf toward Native Americans. They feel that it's something they grew up with - their - in their childhood, and they think it's a cartoon.\n\nBARNETT: Shaw says Monday's announcement by Major League Baseball was just the other shoe dropping after Commissioner Rob Manfred announced last spring that he was working with Indians management to phase out Chief Wahoo. The image will be gone from the field, but not necessarily from the gift shop, and fans can certainly still sport their Wahoo paraphernalia. Again, Bud Shaw.\n\nSHAW: Listen, I have Indians fans in my neighborhood that feel very strongly about this, that they're not racist, they shouldn't be made to feel as if they are, that this is just something that's part of their history.\n\nBARNETT: But a new chapter of that history is set to begin on opening day in 2019.

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nAgain and again, The Race Card Project receives submissions dealing with mixed-race identity; from a child of a mixed-race union, from a parent of mixed-race children or from someone who is trying to figure out how to identify a mixed-race student or colleague, for example.\n\nThose kinds of stories are the largest single category of six-word submissions the Race Card Project receives, says Michele Norris, who curates the project. Many of these entries have a lot to do with labels and identity.\n\nWilma Stordahl, a Seattle resident who's an account manager for a national landscape company, offered one such submission: \"Norwegian with Nappy Hair Doesn't Fit.\"\n\n'What Are They?'\n\nStordahl is Norwegian, and she and her husband are both white. Together they have a 15-year-old white son, but she also has two older sons, Kevin Stordahl, 25, and Kazon Stordahl, 19, who both have a black father.\n\nWilma Stordahl gave them her last name in part because she wanted to make sure they had had a very specific and highly identifiable link to her family heritage.\n\n\"Typically, we think of Norwegians as being tall and blond and blue-eyed,\" Stordahl says. \"And my sons are tall \u2014 but they're not blond and blue-eyed.\"\n\nWhen the boys travel around with their tall, blonde mother, Stordahl says they draw quizzical stares and even questions from strangers.\n\n\"They'll usually lean in and quietly say, 'What are they?' And what they really want to ask is, 'What race are they?' \"\n\nStordahl typically answers with \"handsome,\" but she knows it's also more complicated than her tongue-in-cheek answer.\n\n\"In my 20s, I wanted to call them mixed-race. I wanted to say that they were some other thing, some other category than what was listed on all the forms that you fill out,\" Stordahl explains. \"But I was repeatedly corrected, and actually, I was most frequently corrected by African Americans.\"\n\nThey would tell her, \" 'No, honey \u2014 your son is black,' \" she says. \"Like, just get used to it, because that's how the world's gonna see them.\"\n\nStordahl did get used to those conversations, but she also wishes that people would move away from what she considers instinctive labeling of people based just on skin color or appearance \u2014 especially as more children are born of mixed-race couplings.\n\nNot Mixed-Race, But Mixed-Heritage\n\nWhen her son Kazon is asked these kinds of questions, he prefers to answer that he's mixed-race and leave it at that, Stordahl explains. But Kevin, she says, rejects that label for something more precise; he prefers the term \"mixed-heritage.\"\n\n\"He is rebelling against that idea that he's not just black and he's not just white,\" Stordahl says. \"He's of mixed-heritage. There's all these other customs and traits and things like that that also come with heritage.\"\n\nKevin, a sociology major who wants to focus on the study of mixed-race identity, has also taken a keen interest in his Norwegian background, pursuing Scandinavian studies in college and studying Norwegian.\n\nHis mother is thrilled, but she also has some concerns. \"There's another part of me that has a little bit of maybe guilt, that perhaps if it wasn't that he was of mixed-heritage, that perhaps he would be spending his time pursing something that would produce a more lucrative career,\" she says.\n\n\"I worry that perhaps he's ended up spending all of his energy and time and tuition on this question of identity \u2014 and maybe that he's searching for something within himself.\"\n\nBut, she says, Kevin assures her this is the path that makes him happy, \"so I'm gonna leave it at that.\"\n\nStordahl knows that when people look at her tall, brown-skinned boys \u2014 now young men \u2014 that they might not immediately recognize their Norwegian heritage. That makes her sad, but she also knows that if people take the time to really look hard at them, the Stordahl family is there, in their height and in their faces.\n\n\"I often have joked that my sons don't look a whole lot like me,\" Stordahl says. \"But in fact ... we all have the same eyes. Not the color, but the shape. They're all tall, like me \u2014 they're actually taller than me now.\n\n\"They are a part of me, and I a part of them.

Karen Bass is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. NPR's Michel Martin talks to her about President Trump's relationship with the group of lawmakers, and his presidency so far.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nI also spoke with Congresswoman Karen Bass. She is a Democrat from California. And she also has a deep background as a lawmaker, having served as a former speaker of the California Assembly. She's also an officer of the Congressional Black Caucus. When we spoke, I began by asking her to reflect on then-candidate Trump's attempt to appeal to African-American voters when he famously said, what do you have to lose?\n\nKAREN BASS: They used to refer to him as a dog whistle, but I think most people now recognize it's a bullhorn. I think this last year has been absolutely positively horrific. We have seen a level of racism become normalized, something that we haven't seen for decades. And anytime you have the president of the United States making statements like he did a week ago about the entire continent of Africa, it's - he's consistent. How he views people of color around the world is the same as he views people of color in the United States. When he's talking about making America great again, many of us hear that as making America white again.\n\nMARTIN: Well, let's go back to when you and other officers from the Congressional Black Caucus actually met with President Trump. That was in March of last year. Do you remember that meeting? Do you remember what your impressions were of him then?\n\nBASS: I remember the meeting extremely well. And I do think it's important to say what led to the meeting because, you remember, there was a press conference in which he was asked about his urban agenda. And a reporter said, have you consulted the Congressional Black Caucus? He didn't know who the CBC was. But he did say to the reporter, who happened to be African-American, well, do you know them? You know, can you organize the meeting? As, of course, all black people do know each other.\n\nAnd so the Congressional Black Caucus was extended an invitation for all 49 of our members to go to the White House. We chose to just send the leadership. We took the time to write a 125-page document that basically said, this is what we have to lose. Each of us made a presentation on a substantive area of policy. Mine was criminal justice. And basically, he wasn't really able to have a dialogue. We do think he paid attention. I just don't think that there was any there there to actually have a dialogue with us. And then he also made it clear just a few days ago what he thinks about the Congressional Black Caucus. When the Democratic senators mentioned that the CBC would be upset at the immigration proposal, he basically said he had no interest in what the Congressional Black Caucus said.\n\nMARTIN: Well, speaking of those comments, I mean, over the course of the year, and even before that during the campaign, there were many remarks and tweets and policy proposals aimed at a lot of groups, you know - Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Muslims, Muslim-Americans. And a lot of these comments have sparked commentary. But it's only after those comments about those countries that that he is reported to have made - and he denies that he said that - but it is after that that many people, including some of your colleagues, have said that they believe that he's racist, that he harbors racist views. They've been very blunt about that over the course of the week. And I'd like to ask you. And I think you may have already answered that. Do you think that that's true?\n\nBASS: I think he has demonstrated that he is a racist, and he's demonstrated that over many decades, going back to when he was a young man in the housing discrimination lawsuits. But I will tell you something. It's way more significant to me. His policies are far more significant, and he demonstrated that on the first few days of his presidency.\n\nOn his first day of the presidency, he eliminated a program that gave tax credits for first-time homeowners. He rolled back consent decrees with troubled police departments. He's tried to eliminate the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. They were seeking attorneys that wanted to overturn affirmative action.\n\nHis words are horrific, but his policies are damaging. And the wreckage that he has done to the government, even without congressional involvement, is, to me, far more important. You know, attacking NFL players, I mean, that was egregious. But doing what he's done policy wise is far, far more significant and dangerous to our communities.\n\nMARTIN: That is Congresswoman Karen Bass, Democrat of California. She's one of the officers of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congresswoman, thank you so much for speaking with us.\n\nBASS: Thanks for having me on.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Advocates of that campaign hit another roadblock Friday, when the Census Bureau announced it is not planning to add a MENA category to the 2020 census.\n\n\n\n\"We do feel that more research and testing is needed,\" Karen Battle, chief of the bureau's population division, explained Friday at a public meeting on 2020 census preparations.\n\nResearchers at the bureau have been looking into how to better collect race and ethnicity information from census participants of Middle Eastern or North African descent. In a report released last year, they concluded that \"it is optimal to use a dedicated 'Middle Eastern or North African' response category\" on the 2020 census questionnaires.\n\n\"The inclusion of a MENA category helps MENA respondents to more accurately report their MENA identities,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut at Friday's meeting, Battle said the bureau has received public comments that show that \"a large segment of the Middle Eastern and North African population\" think that MENA should be treated as a category not for race but ethnicity, which she said the bureau so far has not specifically tested.\n\nMany advocates for a MENA category are disappointed by the Census Bureau's decision. In a written statement, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, Maya Berry, called the announcement a \"severe blow\" to efforts to get a better count of people with roots in the Middle East or North Africa.\n\n\"Our communities, like all others, rely on representation through legislative redistricting, civil rights laws, and education and health statistics. A continued undercount will cause harm,\" Berry writes. She adds that more detailed census data could help improve access to health research and language assistance for the MENA population.\n\nBerry says advocates will turn to Congress for support in overturning the bureau's decision. She also points out that the Arab American Institute and other advocates for a MENA category have long called for the bureau to consider MENA as a category for ethnicity.\n\nThat distinction has been under consideration by the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which sets the standards for how the bureau and other federal agencies collect race and ethnicity data. Right now, those standards require ethnicity to be asked on federal surveys only in terms of \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino.\"\n\nThere is a proposal, first introduced during the Obama administration, to change those standards so that all federal agencies must ask about MENA as an ethnicity or as a distinct racial group separate from \"White,\" which according to current federal standards, includes anyone \"having origins in any of the original peoples\" of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has not released any decision on the proposal. Some advocates for a MENA category have voiced concerns about the timing of this long-running policy discussion. They say they are worried about the implications of the Trump administration issuing a potential new federal requirement for more detailed MENA data more than a year after President Trump issued travel bans against MENA countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria and Yemen.\n\n\"It's really a double-edged sword,\" said Helen Samhan, a co-founder of the Arab American Institute who began campaigning for a separate MENA category in the early 1990s, in an interview before the Census Bureau's announcement on Friday.\n\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget has not responded to NPR's request for comment on the proposal. Census experts say that the bureau's announcement on Friday to not include a MENA category on its 2020 questionnaire suggests the Trump administration will not support the Obama-era proposal to change the federal standards on race and ethnicity data.\n\nIn the meantime, the bureau is under pressure to finalize how it will ask about race and ethnicity in 2020. A report on the final wording of the 2020 questions is due to Congress by the end of March, and preparations for an upcoming practice run of the 2020 census this year in Rhode Island's Providence County are well underway.\n\nOn Friday, the bureau released the questionnaire it plans to use for that practice run. The form includes a major change from the 2010 census that, while not creating a separate MENA category, could generate more detailed MENA data.\n\nThe questionnaire for this year's test run of the 2020 census asks participants who check off \"White\" to also write in their \"origins.\" And among the suggested answers are examples of two of the largest Middle Eastern and North African nationality groups in the U.S. \u2014 \"Lebanese\" and \"Egyptian.\"", "keywords": ["eastern", "standards", "ethnicity", "bureau", "middle", "census", "federal", "african", "north", "category", "mena", "2020"], "polarity": 0.13472650231124808, "subjectivity": 0.3527203022965736},

Their D.C. shop, Metro Liquors, was closed for business on Aug. 28, 1963, just one of 1,900 businesses ordered by local authorities not to sell, pour or wrap any alcoholic beverage from 12:01 that morning until 2 a.m. the next day.\n\nMaury Landsman, whose parents ran Metro Liquors, doesn't think his parents actually minded the order that much. For one, his father rarely got vacations, Landsman says. Manny Landsman worked six days a week at the store in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, which was a largely poor and black community back then \u2014 not the trendy spot it is today.\n\nThe second reason, Landsman says, stemmed from his white father's typical, even stereotypical, views \u2014 views he held despite having some African-American employees. \"I recall my father used to say black men always had mustaches and drank a lot.\"\n\nMaury, 20 at the time, didn't share those views. While the liquor store order left Maury 's parents free to stay home, Maury had different ideas about how he would spend the day.\n\nResisting His Parents' \"White-Privileged Attitudes\"\n\nThe decision by the Board of D.C. Commissioners, and similar ones in the nearby Maryland suburbs, temporarily depressed the local economy on an otherwise festive day. For the most part, consumers and local residents not participating in the march stayed home rather than going to work or running errands. Newspapers often describe the atmosphere as a quiet Sunday.\n\nD.C. Commissioner Walter N. Tobriner's written statement, quoted in The Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, said the order wasn't a reflection on the nonviolent demonstrators, \"who will be under strict discipline.\" His concern was that nonparticipants \"might well tend to disturb the peace and quiet of the city\" under the influence of alcohol.\n\nSo while his parents stayed home and watched the march on TV, Landsman headed down to the Mall. He had come home to the Washington suburbs two months earlier, after two years at the University of Chicago. He knew about the march from his student activism in the Windy City, he says, and made up his mind early that he was going. He even invited some of his Chicago buddies to camp out at his parents' apartment for the demonstration.\n\nLandsman also joined some of the new and growing left-leaning groups of the time \u2014 the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Students for a Democratic Society and the Northern Student Movement. While his civil rights activism began while he was a college student, he says his views may have taken shape even before then.\n\n\"I was raised, in fact, in segregated schools until I was in about the sixth grade,\" he says. \"I went from kindergarten through high school in D.C. public schools.\" It wasn't until the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that the city's schools were integrated. He says his parents had no black friends when they lived in D.C., and he only visited other black students in their homes, never the other way around.\n\n\n\n\"My parents were strange, politically,\" he says. \"I'd describe them as working-class Democrats. They weren't actually racists, but they shared racial attitudes \u2014 what's now called white-privileged attitudes \u2014 of the majority of white people in the United States.\"\n\nLandsman had debates over race with his father's lawyer, a man he occasionally called \"Uncle\" and who was the son of Jewish immigrants, like his father. \"I would get into arguments about how Jews, given the history of the Holocaust, could be bigoted. I remember ... walking out of his house a couple of times,\" he says.\n\nThere were prevailing tensions at home between Landsman, his parents and their upwardly mobile friends and relatives. It was no better after he told them of his plans to attend the march. Safety, not politics, was their issue, he says. \"[It's] not that they were opposed. They were worried about my getting hurt. But I went anyway and they didn't try to stop me.\"\n\n\"Strangers, Black And White, Holding Hands\"\n\nLandsman's memories of the March on Washington revolve around feelings of \"being lifted up,\" he says. \"I was on the left side of the Reflecting Pool near the Lincoln Memorial. I can capture in my mind some of the songs. Some of John Lewis' speech is still in my mind.\n\n\"I remember Marian Anderson, Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan. I remember Joan Baez. I always found her singing uplifting, and 'We Shall Overcome' \u2014 that was amazing.\"\n\nAs the crowd marched, \"there were strangers, black and white, holding hands\" and singing that song and other spirituals that marked the movement, he says, like \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.\"\n\nLandsman can vaguely imagine his parents watching the day's events on their black-and-white TV but can't recall if they ever discussed it. And the next day, when liquor stores reopened, it was business as usual.\n\nIn the end, Landsman received praise for his activism from his parents' friends, which he says made his parents secretly proud.\n\nNow 70, Landsman is a retired University of Minnesota law professor. Looking back, he's proud of his activism, first around civil rights and later against the Vietnam War. His wife, Julie, has been similarly involved, writing and lecturing on education and race. He describes his son, Aaron, as a \"good progressive, doing his part.\"\n\nWhen asked to offer a six-word statement on race relations today, 50 years after the march, for The Race Card Project, Landsman put it this way: \"Progress, but we are falling back.\"", "keywords": ["63", "black", "activism", "biases", "racial", "white", "washington", "joining", "landsman", "race", "parents", "views", "dc", "student", "despite"], "polarity": 0.036909867909867916, "subjectivity": 0.34256565656565663},

In addition to their bigotry, many of the remarks promulgated outright falsehoods.\n\n\"We're promoting birth control to a black woman because of the incredibly high rate of children born out of wedlock that are undercared for or not cared for at all,\" Higbie said in one quote from a segment in which he accused black people of \"a lax of morality.\"\n\nIn another segment that dealt with immigration, Higbie is quoted saying, \"What's so wrong with wanting to put up a fence and saying, 'Hey, everybody with a gun, if you want to go shoot people coming across our border illegally, you can do it' \" for free.\n\nAfter the CNN report emerged, Higbie resigned from his post.

The team name \u2014 which has also been criticized as offensive \u2014 will not be changing.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,\" MLB's commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a statement. \"Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indians organization about the Club's use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [Indians CEO] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball, and I appreciate Mr. Dolan's acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course,\" Manfred said.\n\nRay Halbritter, a member of Oneida Nation and the leader of the \"Change the Mascot\" protest campaign, celebrated the change.\n\n\"The Cleveland baseball team has rightly recognized that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots, and the team's move is a reflection of a grassroots movement that has pressed sports franchises to respect Native people,\" Halbritter said in a statement.\n\nOther Native activists expressed more skepticism.\n\n\"It's a small step in the right direction, but it is just that \u2014 a small step,\" Cleveland activist Sundance told NPR.\n\nSundance, a member of the Muskogee Creek Nation and the executive director of the Cleveland American Indian Movement, has been a long-standing critic of Chief Wahoo.\n\n\"The team is still going to be able to license Wahoo and make money off of that racist image,\" he says. \"The environment down at the stadium is not going to change for the better. ... People are still going to wear Wahoo to the stadium, they are still going to dress in red face, they are still going to give war whoops, all under the rubric of being Indian.\"\n\nSundance was involved in a lawsuit back in 1972, attempting to force the team to drop the logo.\n\nAs Indian Country Today reports, Native resistance to the logo has continued ever since, including at annual opening day protests:\n\n\"Those Native American protesters who gather at the ironically named Progressive Field\u2014some of them members of the Cleveland American Indian Movement (AIM) and the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance\u2014have not been met with open arms or friendly words. Cleveland's baseball fans have hurled beer cans and spat on them. The protesters have been called stupid and 'Custer-killers.' Cleveland AIM calls the use of the Chief Wahoo mascot 'bigoted, racist and shameful,' and the Committee of 500 complains that the logo is a negative stereotype against indigenous people.\"\n\nProtesters have objected to the Cleveland Indians' name as well as to the Chief Wahoo image.\n\nAnd those protests will continue, Sundance says. \"We're still going to be out there on opening day, until that name is changed,\" he says.\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians praised MLB for \"setting the example for how professional sports leagues can and should respect Native peoples.\"\n\nOther sports teams \u2014 most conspicuously, Washington's football team \u2014 have also faced decades of protest and criticism for their use of offensive racial stereotypes, caricatures or slurs as official names or mascots. But notably, the debate over the Cleveland Indians logo has resulted in visible changes, as The Associated Press notes:\n\n\"Under growing pressure to eliminate Chief Wahoo, the club has been transitioning away from the logo in recent years. The Indians introduced a block 'C' insignia on some of their caps and have removed signs with the Wahoo logo in and around Progressive Field, the team's downtown ballpark. \"National criticism and scrutiny about the Indians' allegiance to Chief Wahoo grew in 2016, when the Indians made the World Series and Manfred expressed his desire to have the team eradicate the symbol. Earlier in that postseason, a lawsuit was filed while the club was playing in Toronto to have the logo and team name banned from appearing on Canadian TV. That court case was dismissed by a judge. \"The Indians' bid to host the 2019 All-Star Game, which it was ultimately awarded, further heightened debate over Wahoo.\"\n\nSupporters of the logo have expressed frustration and sorrow to see it go \u2014 and promised that it's not disappearing from stands.\n\n\"Sadly, the Indians caved to the politically correct society that we are now all forced to live in,\" Zach Sharon of Cleveland Sports Talk wrote. He said the logo is a representation of the team \u2014 one that reminds fans of the glory years of the '90s, when \"those great teams all sported the Chief Wahoo on their jerseys and those memories give myself and other fans goosebumps.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, fans will continue to wear their Chief Wahoo apparel, probably even more now,\" Sharon wrote. \"I know I will. You'll see it in the stands and around the city every Indians game. It'll never truly go away.\"\n\nCleveland lawyer and sportswriter Peter Pattakos, who opposes the logo, also predicted that the change will lead to more Chief Wahoo in stands, not less. For him, that was a cause for frustration, not celebration.\n\nPattakos spoke to NPR in 2014, after he tweeted out a viral photo of a Native man confronting an Indians fan in red face. He described how he grew from a kid who \"didn't think of a Native American at all\" when he saw the logo to an adult fan who says \"the impact is so obviously racist and demeaning.\"\n\nNow he is frustrated with how MLB decided to implement this change.\n\n\"If they acknowledge that 'the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball,' what's the excuse for waiting until 2019?\" he tweeted. And the name hasn't changed, he noted, writing, \"Cowardly half-measures won't do.\"\n\nAdrienne Keene, a Cherokee writer who runs a blog about the appropriation of Native cultures, met the news with a celebratory word \u2014 \"FINALLY!!!\"\n\nShe celebrated the fact that instead of just quietly changing the logo, MLB said it was inappropriate to use.\n\n\"Important to note: Even with this decision, you can still buy Chief Wahoo merch in Ohio and at the stadium, and the name is still the Indians,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Not done fighting, but BIG step.\"", "keywords": ["indians", "logo", "fans", "uniforms", "2019", "going", "remove", "cleveland", "wahoo", "american", "native", "chief", "team"], "polarity": 0.06528461017097383, "subjectivity": 0.40145502645502645},

Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThis is the second in a two-part report about Clarence B. Jones and the March on Washington.\n\nAug. 28, 1963, was a tense day for Clarence B. Jones. As the longtime attorney and adviser for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Jones had a long list of worries as people started to fill the streets around the monuments on the National Mall. Were the right permits filed? Would the speakers veer off script? Would enough people show up?\n\n\"I had this feeling that we were going to throw a big party and nobody comes,\" Jones recalls.\n\nBut people did come \u2014 at least 250,000 of them. Still, Jones also worried that the crowd might also include agitators, \"some of what I called 'agent provocateurs' \u2014 white as well as black,\" Jones says. \"I didn't know whether some of the black nationalists who were opposed to Dr. King's non-violence, or whether some of the people from the right wing, the Klan ... would provoke something.\"\n\nAnd then there was the delicate and thorny issue of wrangling all those celebrities, Jones says, like Marlon Brando, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, Joan Baez, Odetta and Bob Dylan, to name just a few.\n\nIn the end, things went smoothly, from the singers and the speakers to the big crowds and blue skies. After sleepless nights and fretful days, Jones was able to take his place on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial and take it all in.\n\n'Tell 'Em About The Dream!'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NPR/Erica Yoon NPR/Erica Yoon\n\nAmong his most vivid memories is singer Mahalia Jackson at the microphone, Jones says. \"How could you not be moved by this woman's voice? You would have to be unfortunately afflicted with some type of muscular disease that would prevent your muscles reacting to what your ear brought to your body.\"\n\nOf all the entertainers that day, Mahalia Jackson was the singer who had a special hold on King. When King was feeling down, he would speak with Jackson on the phone.\n\n\"I guess you would put it now as 'telephone gospel therapy,' \" Jones says. \"And he would speak to Mahalia Jackson and he would say, 'Mahalia, please sing to me. I'm having a rough day today.'\n\n\"And she would sing one or more of his favorite songs, and ... he would close his eyes listening to her,\" Jones continues. \"In some cases, tears would come down his face and then he would say, 'Mahalia, you are giving me the Lord's voice this morning.' \"\n\nKing had enormous respect for Jackson, Jones says. And because of that, the reverend listened to her when she offered him unsolicited advice while King stood at the podium on the day of the march.\n\nWhile he was reading from the prepared text, Jones says, Jackson shouted at King. \"This is after she had performed, of course, she's sitting down, and she just shouted at him ... 'Tell 'em about the dream, Martin! Tell 'em about the dream!' \"\n\nJackson knew that King had delivered a rousing speech earlier that summer at Detroit's Cobo Hall, bringing the crowd to a feverish pitch when he preached about his dream for a better America. So despite King's prepared script that August day, Jackson encouraged him to bring that moment from Detroit to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\"Now, most people probably didn't have the slightest idea what Mahalia was yelling to Dr. King,\" Jones says. \"What he did upon hearing that, he took the text of the speech \u2014 the written text that he was reading \u2014 and he moved it to the left side of the lectern [and] grabbed the lectern with both his hands.\n\n\"And I see this and I turn to the person standing next to me ... and I said, 'These people don't know it, but they're about ready to go to church.' \"\n\nSix Words And The Letter From Birmingham Jail\n\nJones is proud of his contribution to that moment in history, but he still wishes more of King's dream will be realized in his lifetime. He says he's tremendously proud of progress that's been made. But, as Jones wrote in his book, Behind The Dream, as long as there's a need for a legal category for hate crimes, police officers \"pulling over African Americans because they're driving cars considered out of their financial reach,\" and people \"selling their houses because too many black families have moved in,\" the dream remains diluted, tarnished and unfulfilled, he says.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on race today, Jones harkened back to the letter King wrote from inside the jail in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. King scribbled out that letter on scraps of paper and it was Jones who secreted those scraps out of the building during several visits. In the letter, published under the headline, \"Why We Can't Wait,\" King said complacency and hate were the enemies of progress.\n\nSo, when asked to offer his six words on race, Jones replies, \"Hate is why we cannot wait.\"", "keywords": ["fulfilling", "jackson", "mahalia", "adviser", "race", "kings", "letter", "text", "dream", "jones", "wait", "king", "day"], "polarity": 0.03074675324675325, "subjectivity": 0.42880952380952375},

As the phenomenon displaces communities of color, from Inglewood to Washington, D.C., \"gentrification\" has been co-opted to include food and culture as well. So, what does the loaded term really mean?\n\nAccording to urban sociologist John Schlichtman, gentrification cannot happen without disinvestment. In the book Gentrifier, Schlichtman and his co-authors, Marc Hill and Jason Patch, define gentrification as \"the reinvestment of real estate investment money or capital into dis-invested, devalued, centrally-located neighborhoods, which fosters a new infrastructure for middle and high-income residents.\"\n\nThe reason gentrification has a bad rap is due to the inequity between race and housing. \"Race is, at its heart, a class issue,\" Schlichtman says. The devaluing of lower-class neighborhoods, usually residents of color, is the result of a history of unjust policies, including government defunding and redlining.\n\n\"There is an unusual gap between the devaluing and the revaluing in the United States,\" Schlichtman says. \"How that gap is filled needs to be controlled. We can't just let a tsunami of investment fill that gap. It's obviously going to wash things away.\"\n\nSchlichtman spoke with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about the complexities of gentrification, who's responsible for it and how we can minimize the pain it causes through a conscious shifting of priorities.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nWho is a gentrifier?\n\nA gentrifier is a middle-class person who moves into a disinvested context at a time when other people are doing the same. And, that middle-class person is bringing middle-class buying power. And that effect occurs regardless of the racial, religious, class upbringing of that individual. But they're entering into a context in which that devaluing occurred through decades and decades of unjust policies: defunding by the government, redlining, racial covenants, blockbusting.\n\nOn \"gentrifier guilt\"\n\nThat guilt is felt because there is a perception that someone is benefiting from an unjust gap. The first question I ask in regards to gentrifier guilt is: What is the just context for a middle-class housing consumer? Is it the suburb? Is it the devalued neighborhood? Is it the bottom of a middle-class enclave in the city that has never had the devaluing? Is that the just context?\n\nThere are many people of all backgrounds in the United States who are struggling with their housing choice and trying to figure out what the ethical footprint of their housing choice will be. I would argue that we have painted ourselves into a corner because of our history in the United States where there isn't a just housing choice.\n\nOn advice for people who have moved into a gentrified neighborhood\n\nYou can't behave your way out of gentrification, but you can be a kind person. Much of the pain that occurs as a result of gentrification is the result of people who move into neighborhoods and they're imagining a future neighborhood. So no, supporting businesses that are currently existing, that's not going to stop gentrification but it is going to make people like you more.\n\nI think people need to own where they live; don't say you can't live somewhere else if you're middle-class. You could live in that suburb that isn't gentrifying. You could live at the bottom end of that middle-class community in the city that isn't gentrifying. But, there are other things that you're looking for. You're looking for class diversity, a racial diversity, an ethnic diversity. You're looking for restaurants; you're looking for a specific type of architecture. So, be honest about your housing choice.\n\nAnd finally, this needs to be fought with large-scale things. We need to put pressure on our city governments as a community to not put profit and investment as the number one priority. It can be balanced with other priorities of community.", "keywords": ["housing", "choice", "gentrifier", "live", "neighborhoods", "enabled", "middleclass", "gentrification", "schlichtman", "looking", "isnt", "pains", "weve", "youre"], "polarity": 0.09289772727272726, "subjectivity": 0.4699179292929293},

Jones and the March on Washington.\n\n\n\nAsk Clarence B. Jones to identify himself, and he'll tick off a list of titles. \"I live in Palo Alto, Calif., and I am a visiting professor at the University of San Francisco, and a scholar, writer-in-residence at Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Institute.\"\n\nJones was also the first black man to make partner at a Wall Street investment bank, but he's leaving something else out, too. Jones, 81, was also the personal attorney and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. during the height of the civil rights movement. Fifty years ago, on the eve of the March on Washington, Jones was working hard to make sure every detail went off without a hitch. Jones remembers it as \"a stressful day.\"\n\nFor all the reminiscing over the years about King and his dream for a better America, the organizers of the march were not just stargazing about change. They had a long and highly specific set of demands. That 10-point list included \"dignified jobs at decent wages,\" \"desegregation of all school districts,\" and a ban on discrimination in \"all housing supported by federal funds,\" among other things.\n\nThe Genesis Of 'The Promissory Note'\n\nJones knew that King would need strong words and strong imagery to make that case. So he suggested language based on a recent experience in Birmingham, Ala. When hundreds of children were arrested after the Children's March in Birmingham in May \u2014 where dogs and fire hoses were unleashed on youngsters \u2014 civil rights organizers needed cash to make bail.\n\n\"I got a call \u2014 an urgent call \u2014 from Harry Belafonte, because we were getting enormous pressure from the parents of these kids to get them out of jail,\" Jones recalls.\n\nThe Rockefeller family wanted to help, so Jones had to fly to New York, go to a bank vault and sign a promissory note in exchange for $100,000 in cash.\n\nThat means, Jones explains, that \"when the creditor calls you and say[s], 'Pay me,' you pay that person.\"\n\nSo when he was helping King draft talking points for his speech, Jones suggested that event would make a powerful analogy.\n\n\"You know, coming here to Washington ... is like we are coming to our nation's capitol and ask[ing] to be repaid, or ask[ing]to be paid in full, on a promissory note,\" Jones says. \"Well, there has to be sufficient funds in the vaults of justice in this country.\"\n\nIndeed, King used that image of a bounced check to assert that America had failed to live up to its promise. \"It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned,\" King intoned from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \"Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' \"\n\nJones has chronicled his work with King in his book, Behind the Dream, co-authored with Stuart Connelly. And while working on the memoir, Jones had some unlikely source material.\n\ntoggle caption Emily Bogle/FBI\n\nAn Unexpected Historical Archive\n\n\"Little did we know until years later, that every single conference call we had, every single telephone conversation related to the march and other matters, was wiretapped and the contents transcribed by the FBI. So while we would be having so-called confidential conference calls, there was another party that was also a part of everything we did,\" Jones says. \"The contents were wire recorded, transcribed and written into a daily running transcript.\"\n\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy signed off on the wiretaps, Jones says. And because of those wiretaps, Jones now knows how the FBI viewed King's performance at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nSubsequently, Jones says, he was reviewing an internal top-secret FBI memo, when he learned that the FBI considered King dangerous.\n\nUnder a memo titled \"Negro Question,\" the FBI memo said this about King: \"He stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation.\"\n\nThat memo was dated Aug. 30, 1963 \u2014 two days after the March on Washington. All these years later, Jones is actually grateful for those wiretaps. Thanks to the FBI, he has a vast \u2014 and accurate \u2014 archive of the time.\n\n\"If I have a fuzzy memory or hazy memory, I look at it, and there's a verbatim transcript of the conversations about a certain event, a certain person or a certain problem we were discussing,\" Jones says.\n\nJones always thought the government was listening. King, he says, didn't want to believe him.\n\n\"In his harshest moments, he would \u2014 not accuse me, but he would characterize me as being a 'left-wing McCarthyite.' That I was seeing FBI agents under the bed and all around, just like Joseph McCarthy saw Communists,\" Jones recalls. \"It would come up because often we would have conference calls around 10:30, 11:00 at night, and that's after I had maybe two martinis and a shot of Jack Daniels. ...\n\n\"Anyway, I would get on the phone, and I would say, 'OK, is everybody ready now?' ... And I'd say, 'OK, Mr. FBI man or FBI woman, do you have your pencil ready? Do you have your pad ready now? Because we're gonna start this conference call.'\n\n\"And Dr. King would say, 'Clarence, why don't you stop that? ... They have much better things to do than to listen to our conversation.' \"\n\nOf course, Jones had the last laugh \u2014 and even now, 50 years later, he laughs as he recounts the conversation. \"I said, 'Oh really?'

The music publishers that copyrighted the song in the 1960s settled the lawsuit on Friday.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn a few minutes, we'll meet one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. And that reminded us that, often, a movement becomes identified with a key word or phrase. In the civil rights era, that phrase was we shall overcome. Ironically, the song that gave rise to the phrase has become intertwined with prolonged litigation. But yesterday, a federal judge in New York signed an order that puts it into the public domain. Rick Karr reports.\n\nRICK KARR, BYLINE: A couple of music publishing companies claimed that they owned the copyright on a version of \"We Shall Overcome\" from 1963. It's credited to a group of writers, including the late Pete Seeger.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE SHALL OVERCOME\")\n\nPETE SEEGER: (Singing) We shall overcome.\n\nKARR: But even Seeger knew that the song predated his version.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSEEGER: It was known among the food and tobacco workers, mainly Negro union members. And I heard them singing it in 1947.\n\nKARR: Last year, musician and filmmaker Isaias Gamboa filed suit to strip the song of copyright. He based his claim on years of research for a documentary film about the song's history. The case was set to go to trial next month until Gamboa laid out his evidence in a deposition.\n\nISAIAS GAMBOA: One of the things that I opened with is there's only one truth. And somebody here is telling the truth and somebody isn't.\n\nKARR: Gamboa found lots of older versions of \"We Shall Overcome.\" The judge in the case had already stripped copyright from the song's first and most famous verse. After Gamboa's deposition, the music publishers backed down. Now that the song's in the public domain, Gamboa says, anyone can use it, like the dance student who contacted him last year.\n\nGAMBOA: He wanted to perform \"We Shall Overcome\" in a dance recital for his final. And his professor told him he could not do so unless he had a clearance from the people who were claiming the copyrights. And it broke his heart.\n\nKARR: Gamboa says he's not interested in damages, but the judge still has one decision to make - how much money the music publishers, who collected well over a million dollars in royalties from the copyright, owe attorney's fees and court costs.

But two former D.C. police officers who worked the event that day remember that there was no guarantee that the day would go smoothly.\n\nBack in 1963, Joseph Burden, who is black, and Martin Niverth, who is white, were both rookie cops with the D.C. police department, living in a highly segregated city and working for a segregated police force.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Martin Niverth Courtesy of Martin Niverth\n\n\"If you walked a foot beat, you walked with another white officer,\" Niverth says. \"If you were assigned to a car, you were assigned to a car with another white officer.\"\n\n\"I do recall, at one time, they passed out 3x5 cards and ... instructed us to write down whether you would like to work with an integrated partner,\" Burden remembers. \"The 'noes' were overwhelming. So it was quite obvious that, as far as they [the white officers] were concerned, they didn't want to work with us. And I guess they really had very little use for Martin Luther King.\"\n\nAll Hands On Deck\n\nFor a segregated police force, a mass demonstration calling for racial equality presented challenges. The police department readied the officers by stressing the need to maintain order and the dignity of the force. After all, this was just months after Birmingham's commissioner for public safety, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, had unleashed dogs and fire hoses on peaceful demonstrators in that city.\n\nThough 19,000 federal troops were stationed just outside the D.C. city limits, police officers in Washington were not instructed to wear riot gear. Officers wore \"no special equipment, just regular uniforms that we would use if we were walking the beat,\" Burden says.\n\n\"Before I went to work, I shined my shoes, cleaned by brass, checked my revolver, and made sure I had my badge and my wallet,\" Niverth recalls.\n\nEveryone worked that day \u2014 no vacation days were granted. The entire force gathered early at the police garage downtown for instructions. It was a hot, humid day in the nation's capital, even at 6 a.m., Niverth remembers. Both officers recall that the instructions were fairly simple: Be alert. Be safe. Keep calm.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Erica Yoon/NPR Erica Yoon/NPR\n\nBurden was assigned to the Lincoln Memorial and ended up on the steps right behind where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his speech. Niverth was instructed to patrol a several-block stretch along the National Mall, quite a distance from where the central activities were taking place.\n\n\"You just do what you do any other day, you know,\" he says. \"You just walked the beat, [made] sure things are orderly.\"\n\nTwo Officers, Different Opportunities\n\nBut Niverth's partner assignment that day was anything but routine.\n\n\"I don't know why they did this; they assigned me with another rookie \u2014 and he was a black officer,\" Niverth says. \"His name was William Wallace.\"\n\n\"I wasn't out there too long before I did realize that this was a pretty significant event,\" Niverth says. By 9 a.m., \"people started to show up, and they started to show up in great numbers. ... You could see they had a purpose. But they weren't angry. I didn't feel threatened as a police officer on the street.\"\n\nIn fact, one black family in attendance shared their lunch with Niverth and Wallace. \"Me and Wallace walked over and they asked us if we wanted something. And they gave us a small plate.\"\n\nNiverth and Wallace may have had shared personal ambitions for growth in their department, but the signs and speakers at the March reminded Niverth that the playing field was not level back in 1963.\n\n\"We weren't walking the beat in our area too long and [Wallace] says, 'Marty, ... I hope you think this is an important day, that it's important to us.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Yes, I do.' \"\n\nAnd as speaker after speaker called for equality and justice, Burden felt somewhat torn as a rookie cop. \"Being a police officer, not too long out of the police academy, you're thinking more of the law than you are thinking in terms of how you fit into the big picture,\" Burden says. \"So I was thinking in terms of, you know, if you're shutting down traffic and what not, that's a violation.\"\n\nYet the marchers were fighting for rights that Burden didn't have. \"When I saw those signs and placards and whatnot that the people were holding, then I realized, you know, they were speaking about me as well.\n\n\"You know, I had a job, but I needed the freedom as well. I was thinking back on the times when I couldn't go into the five-and-dime store to drink a Coke at the counter, and I couldn't go to the theaters downtown and things of this nature,\" Burden continues. \"When I think back, yes, I wish I could have marched.\"\n\nA Changed Force, A Changed Nation\n\nBurden and Niverth both say that, in all their years of police work, the March for Jobs and Freedom was the most peaceful and most festive mass demonstration they had ever seen. The event helped usher in a new era in the D.C. Police Department \u2014 more promotions, more integrated partnerships and more recruiting of women and people of color.\n\nTwo years later, Joe Burden became one of the first black officers assigned to an integrated patrol car in Washington. And Martin Niverth became lifelong friends with William Wallace, the officer with whom he was partnered at the march in '63.

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" on Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nMany images from the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom have taken on iconic status. One of them is a photo of a young black girl attending the march. You may have seen this picture, because it has been used in documentaries, textbooks and museum exhibits. She has short hair with bangs and is holding a black and white banner. The girl is not smiling; in fact, it's hard to put a finger on her emotions \u2014 anger? Impatience? Sorrow?\n\nRowland Scherman is the freelance photographer who snapped that picture while on assignment for the U.S. Information Agency. He was taking photos and saw a girl in the front row of a crowd near where Martin Luther King Jr. made his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n\n\"And I see some people laughing, and some people crying and some people earnest. And ... not only was she beautiful, but she was so involved,\" Scherman says.\n\nThe girl in that picture is Edith Lee-Payne. She's from Detroit, and the day of the March was her 12th birthday. For decades, she had no idea that she'd become a poster child for the civil rights movement. But in October 2008, her cousin spotted the picture on the back of a black history calendar.\n\n\"And she phoned to tell me, and I didn't believe her,\" Lee-Payne says. \"Because also on the front cover, as well as the back, were pictures of Frederick Douglass, Dr. Martin Luther King, Sojourner Truth, Jesse Owens and a number of other very well-known people. So why would my face be with theirs?\"\n\nThen, Lee-Payne looked it up online.\n\nBeing at that march, I guess I was kind of glad to be standing with people that wanted to make things right.\n\n\"So I immediately went to my computer, pulled it up, and lo and behold, there was this calendar image of the front and back cover of the calendar with my face on it.\"\n\nLee-Payne still has the black and white banner she's holding in the picture. In the top left corner it says, \"I was there.\"\n\nAn \"Enlightening\" Experience\n\nThe famous photo provides eternal proof that she was indeed at the March on Washington. The picture now lives at the National Archives. Lee-Payne has her own copy, personally signed by the photographer. Even without that photographic testament, the day is seared into her memory.\n\n\"It was important for my mother to be there,\" Lee-Payne says. \"And being her one and only child, it was important for me to be there with her.\"\n\nLee-Payne's family arrived at the National Mall early on Aug. 28. Her namesake, her Aunt Edith, was volunteering at the Red Cross tent and had to check in well ahead of the crowds, which helps explain why she had such a choice spot toward the front.\n\nLee-Payne's mother had once worked as an entertainer and knew a lot of people in show business. She was a dancer who opened for Cab Calloway, and she sometimes baby-sat for Sammy Davis Jr. when he was just a child star. Lee-Payne and her mother's vantage point near the entry to the stage allowed her mom to catch up with old friends, Lee-Payne says.\n\n\"Lena Horne came over where we were standing to talk to my mother, and in listening to them [it] was my first experience in learning some of the things that my mother had been subjected to,\" Lee-Payne recalls. \"Having to enter hotels through the back door, in things that they saw, in driving in a bus or on a train going from one state or city to the other. Those were things that my mother had never shared with me.\"\n\nShe had talked about being an entertainer, Lee-Payne says, but not about the hardship of being a black entertainer. Horne and Lee-Payne's mother didn't talk for a very long time, Lee-Payne says, \"but they talked about the purpose for being there and what it meant to them, so in sharing those things, it was enlightening to me.\"\n\nWhen Lee-Payne heard King talk about his dream for America, she indeed felt that her life embodied some of what he envisioned.\n\n\"I already lived that. I was able to go to integrated schools. When I was 5, 6, 7 years old, my next-door neighbors were white. Whenever we got on the bus, there was never any issue about where we sat,\" Lee-Payne says. \"We would frequently eat out and sit at lunch counters served by black and white waitresses. There were never any incidents. Being at that march, I guess I was kind of glad to be standing with people that wanted to make things right.\"\n\nLooking For Leadership To \"Move Us Forward\"\n\nBut as Lee-Payne moved into adulthood, she says, that dream felt like it started to disintegrate. She did well in school and studied business administration. But, she says, when she went searching for work as a secretary, the content of her resume was overshadowed by the color of her skin.\n\n\"I was denied employment at least 50 times, only \u2014 only \u2014 because I was black. As soon as I'd walk through the door, and the employer would see me, I would be told that the job had already been filled, or I probably wouldn't like the job anyway, or they need to reschedule something,\" Lee-Payne says. \"And it was just obvious in the few people that I could see in the office. ... And I never saw African-American women in those positions.\"\n\nLee-Payne eventually found work at Eastman Kodak. Over the years she has also worked as a civic activist, mainly in Detroit.\n\nThe exasperation captured in that photo of a young Edith Lee-Payne, then Edith Lee, still hovers over her heart \u2014 made clear when asked to share her thoughts on race relations in America today. Her six words for The Race Card Project: \"Marches, jobs, freedom and justice? Not.\"\n\n\"Instead of seeing the equality and the justice and the freedom and jobs that we should really have 50 years later, it's not there in a lot of places \u2014 I can't say everywhere,\" Lee-Payne says. \"What we don't have now that we had then, is the kind of leadership to kind of bring it together, to kind of help move us forward.\"\n\nLee-Payne is still working toward change. Her to-do list is still long, so this Aug. 28, she will once again spend her birthday in Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. \"There's no place that I could be, other than there,\" she says. \"It's too personal for me.\"", "keywords": ["1963", "black", "things", "picture", "crowd", "white", "leepayne", "washington", "poster", "race", "kind", "mother", "king", "face", "child"], "polarity": 0.11719682539682533, "subjectivity": 0.45955238095238077},

William Lewis Moore decided to walk along Highway 11 from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., hoping to hand-deliver his letter to Gov. Ross Barnett. Moore wanted Barnett to fundamentally change Mississippi's racial hierarchy \u2014 something unthinkable for a Southern politician at the time.\n\nIn his letter, Moore warned the governor, \"Do not go down in infamy as one who fought the democracy for all which you have not the power to prevent.\" It never reached its destination. Moore was shot on the roadside, a killer never charged.\n\nThrough time, Moore's story has been overshadowed by more emblematic moments that gripped the nation that year, like the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Jackson, Miss., in May and the deaths of four black girls in the September bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala. But while Moore's walk for equality is less well-known, it's an important chapter in the civil rights movement for many.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ellen Johnson Courtesy of Ellen Johnson\n\nA Wagon, A Shopping Cart And A Stack Of Letters\n\nWilliam Moore was born in Binghamton, N.Y., but he was not just another \"Yankee\" sticking his nose where many Southerners believed it didn't belong. Moore had roots in the South. Moore was raised in Russell, Miss., after going to live with his grandparents at the age of 2. As an adult, Moore returned to Binghamton and began organizing demonstrations for civil rights. He also became a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a vital arm of activism at the time.\n\nIf you drove down Highway 11 five decades ago, you might have spotted a middle-aged white man in rumpled clothes and coiffed hair, sporting a gap-toothed grin. You might have thought little of it and kept driving. But when you glanced back, you would have wondered why this guy was pulling a little red wagon, handing letters to people he passed and pushing a grocery cart plastered with a \"Wanted\" poster featuring an image of Jesus. William Moore definitely stuck out.\n\nBut there were people along his route who did more than wonder about strangers like William Moore. Mary Stanton, author of Freedom Walk, a book about Moore and others who continued his effort after his death, describes people who confronted him. The polite individuals interrogated him about his intentions; the rude threatened him.\n\nUltimately, Moore was shot twice in the head at point-blank range near Attalla, Ala. He was left on the side of the road at a picnic area approximately 300 miles short of Jackson. In her book, Stanton describes a frightened Willis Elrod, who stumbled over Moore's body when he pulled over to use the restroom.\n\nFloyd Simpson, a Ku Klux Klan member, was suspected of committing the murder but was never charged.\n\nToday, the patch of dirt at that spot along Highway 11 is now only meaningful to those already aware of Moore's story; the stone picnic tables have long since been removed. Before April 23, 1963, they provided rest for travelers. Afterwards, they symbolized America's troubled past.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Ellen Johnson Courtesy of Ellen Johnson\n\nBut for some, that spot in Alabama inspired action. Decades after Moore's death, Ellen Johnson of Stanhope, N.J., decided the postman's story could not end at that picnic area. In 2008 she and her friend Ken Loukinen set out to finish what Moore started.\n\nDecades Later, Another Attempt\n\nJohnson first learned about Moore's story while watching a film of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an atheist activist, speaking to a group of law students. It's believed that Moore was an atheist and friend of O'Hair, and that she helped make some of the signs he carried on his walk.\n\nOnce Johnson, also an atheist, learned that Moore was killed for his beliefs, she was determined to find and deliver his letter. Johnson located Moore's widow and obtained mimeographed copies that Moore was distributing on his march.\n\nOn the 45th anniversary of Moore's death, with copies of his letter in-hand, Johnson, Loukinen and several others started their journey from the spot where Moore's body was found. Johnson says that she noted at the time that not much of Alabama seemed changed since 1963.\n\n\"There were some places, mostly Alabama, before we left Alabama, that looked like they hadn't changed in 45 years,\" Johnson says. \"Because it looked like I was seeing what Bill Moore saw.\"\n\nBut unlike Moore's journey 50 years ago, Johnson's walk to Jackson in 2008 garnered mild reactions.\n\n\"I think they just wanted to know that we were OK and they moved on,\" Johnson says of travelers who passed them on the road. \"Most people, eh, it was kind of ho-hum.\"\n\nFor Johnson, completing this march was anything but \"ho-hum.\" Johnson says that honoring Moore and others was her ultimate goal. When the marchers arrived at Gov. Haley Barbour's office in 2008, he would not take time to accept the letter. Even so, there was a great sense of accomplishment among the marchers.\n\nMoore's letter still remains undelivered, but Johnson takes pride in completing the postman's walk to Jackson. And though Moore never completed his own march to Mississippi, his values have since been delivered to more zip codes than he could have imagined.", "keywords": ["postmans", "1963", "johnson", "image", "courtesy", "jackson", "ellen", "road", "moores", "letter", "walk", "alabama", "moore", "short", "cut", "justice"], "polarity": 0.1235343632402456, "subjectivity": 0.4404139433551198},

People came from all over the United States to attend the August 1963 event, traveling by more than 200 special trains and more than 2,000 special buses, as well as by plane and bicycle.\n\nStill others traveled by thumb, like 15-year-old Robert Avery and two of his close friends from Gadsden, Ala. The teens were itching to get to Washington for the march, but they couldn't afford the trip, so decided to hitchhike.\n\nBut first, Robert Avery had to convince his mother. It wasn't that hard, he recalls. \"I said, 'We're getting ready to go to Washington. We're going to be hitchhiking. I need a change of clothes, and whatever money you might have.' And she said, 'OK, just be careful.'\n\n\"I had been very active in the movement all summer,\" Avery says, \"so I think she trusted my judgment.\"\n\nRobert Avery was 15 years old when he hitchhiked from Gadsden, Ala., to Washington D.C. He was interviewed by several news organizations about his trip and is seen briefly in The March, a documentary film made by filmmaker James Blue for the United States Information Agency.\n\nDangerous Roads\n\nEven so, she may have prayed hard for her son's safety. In those days, the roads around Gadsden were perilous for anyone who openly supported ending segregation. Just a few months earlier, in April, William Moore, a white Baltimore mailman on a pilgrimage from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., was killed seven miles from Avery's home, on the same highway he and his friends would now travel.\n\nBefore his death, Moore had taken up a one-man stand against segregation and was making the long journey on foot to personally deliver a letter to Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett. He was shot along the side of the road in an area called Noccalula Falls. Though Ku Klux Klan involvement was suspected, the case was never solved.\n\nAvery and his friends, Robert Frank Thomas and James Foster Smith, were plenty nervous as they approached the spot where Moore's body was found.\n\nThat's when Thomas said, \"Look guys, we know where we are. Here's this man who gave his life for us. This should encourage us to go on,\" Avery remembers.\n\nThen, the teens \"stopped at that spot, had a prayer, and as I can remember, never thought about turning around, never got tired, never had any doubt in my mind that we weren't going to make it to Washington from that point on,\" Avery says.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning the boys got their first ride from a Greyhound Bus driver. \"Do you know where you are? Get on this bus!\" he told them. \"And he picked us up and took us to Chattanooga, Tenn.,\" because he knew the danger that we were getting ready to walk into,\" Avery says.\n\nThe bus driver didn't charge the young men for the ride \u2014 a good thing, because they had only a combined $10 among them. They slept in bus terminals and ate sparingly from vending machines. They also walked quite a bit, sometimes more than 30 miles at a stretch.\n\nThey also got rides from all kinds of people. Despite the strong segregation in the South, almost all of the motorists who picked up the three black teens were white. Avery says he never felt uneasy about the rides, with one exception.\n\nWhen Robert Avery hitchhiked to Washington D.C., he and his two traveling companions arrived a week before the demonstration. They made a pay phone call to civil rights activist and D.C. delegate Walter Fauntroy, who helped get them a place to stay at a local YMCA. The three teens were soon put to work, making picket signs for the rally in the organizing office for the March on Washington for $3 a day. Several days before the march and speeches, Avery and his friends met the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 who had come looking for them at their parents' request. Robert Avery Describes Meeting Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"One guy picked us up, and it was a pickup truck, and we had a sign of course saying 'Washington or [Bust]' so everybody knew where we were going. And, he said, \"You boys know it's dangerous out here?' ... And he said, \"Y'all need to be careful.'\n\n\"And just the way he said it kind of raised the hair on the back of your neck. But, I mean, he was an OK guy ... [But] had he said that prior to [getting in] I don't think I would have got in the truck.\"\n\n'Not Far, Long Way To Go'\n\nAs they got closer to D.C. and crossed over from Tennessee into Virginia, their last ride came from a black family; a husband, wife and son.\n\n\"I wish now that we would have talked more to them, because it was at night and we probably slept a lot,\" Avery says. \"They were coming from Lynchburg. They lived in D.C. ... and they were going home. And as I look back again, I know they were God-sent.\"\n\nThat's because, as the group drove through the mountains, they saw black effigies hanging outside service stations. \"You know, the dummies that they hang out, the Rebel flags ... hanging from light posts and whatever,\" Avery recalls. \"That wasn't sending a signal, that was sending a strong message ... So they went to a lot of care to make them to make sure that people understood you can't stop here and buy gas.\"\n\nAvery says that harrowing journey was worth every step. The three friends made it to Washington a week before the scheduled march. They found a place to stay and lucked into a job making signs for the event. The boys even personally met Martin Luther King Jr. while working in the organizing office.\n\nToday, Avery is still an activist and a lawmaker. He's chairman of the finance committee on the Gadsden City Council. He's traveled some distance in life's journey, but when asked to share his six words about the progress made since the March on Washington, he offers, \"Not far, long way to go.\"", "keywords": ["feet", "1963", "king", "teen", "avery", "washington", "teens", "robert", "used", "thumb", "know", "martin", "luther", "dc", "friends", "reach", "determined"], "polarity": 0.07136263736263737, "subjectivity": 0.42337667887667885},

There were broad concerns all the way up to the top levels of government about the March on Washington. How large would the crowd be? Might there be violence?\n\nBut Jack Hansan of Cincinnati was not concerned about all that. A white man who'd been working on civil rights in Ohio, he wanted to be in that number, however large or small the gathering.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\n\"We had to get rid of this \u2014 I don't know how you would say it \u2014 this discrimination that was so prevalent in communities like our education system, our churches,\" Hansan says. \"So participating in the march was like climbing a mountain, and for us, we wanted to be on the top.\"\n\nThat did not sit well with Jack Hansan's father. He wrote a letter pleading for his son to stay put.\n\n\"He lived in Kansas City, Mo., and his message was, 'I wish you wouldn't go,' \" Hansan explains. \"And he said, 'Your real responsibility is to your family, your sons.' But you know, that was him.\"\n\nHansan was one of 500 Cincinnati businessmen and civic activists who took a special train to D.C., leaving Cincinnati at 5 p.m. \"We rode two nights on a train, one up and one back. There was no club car, but it was fun,\" he laughs. The group spent the night talking and schmoozing. \"We were all dressed politely, like we were going to an office \u2014 shirts and ties.\"\n\nThat attire was no accident. Marchers were advised by the local organizing committee to look clean and sharp, dressed as if they were in D.C. to close a deal.\n\nOnce they got to the city, Hansan says he had never seen a crowd that large and integrated. \"I do remember the songs and listening to the entertainers ... I remember Peter, Paul And Mary,\" he laughs. \"I remember the songs more than I do the speeches.\"\n\nEven so, Hansan knew he was witnessing history that day and wanted to tell his wife and four young sons about it. He grabbed a plain postcard, stamped with a Lincoln 4-cent stamp, and jotted down a few words. Hansan, who still has the postcard, chokes up as he reads his note aloud.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\nAs Hansan reads, his wife, Ethel, looks on and weeps. Her husband's trip \u2014 and the uncertainty over what might happen at the march \u2014 was very stressful, she says. \"Just listening to him talk about it, it did bring me to tears remembering back on what it felt to be left back with the little ones and not really knowing what was happening there.\n\n\"Fortunately, we did have a television set and they were broadcasting it, so I was kind of living it vicariously,\" she continues. \"But the little kids were ignored and not properly taken care of most of the day, because I sat in front of the television watching it with a great deal of trepidation.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Jack Hansan Courtesy of Jack Hansan\n\nRev.

He's Catholic and she's Jewish, and the pair has spent a lifetime working on building bridges of all kinds. They've kept a treasure trove of mementos from the march.\n\nWhen asked to share their own six-word stories on race relations in America today, Jack Hansan says, \"We all need to keep trying.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" he says. \"You know, it's not been done.

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition. You can find hundreds of six-word submissions and submit your own at www.theracecardproject.com.\n\nAmericans adopt thousands of children each year. And as the nation has become increasingly diverse, and with the growth of international adoption in recent decades, many of those children don't look like their adoptive parents. That intersection of race and adoption has prompted many people to submit their six words to The Race Card Project, including this submission from a Louisiana woman: \"Black babies cost less to adopt.\"\n\nOther contributors have also addressed the skin-color based fee structure for many adoptions, including Caryn Lantz of Minneapolis. Her six words: \"Navigating world as transracial adopted family.\"\n\nLantz and her husband, both white, are the adoptive parents of two African-American boys. The couple had struggled for years to conceive a child. When they finally decided to turn to adoption they were willing to adopt kids of another race. But they were concerned by what they discovered about the differential costs.\n\nLantz says she remembers a phone call with an adoption agency social worker. \"And [she] was telling us about these different fee structures that they had based on the ethnic background of the child. And ... they also had, sort of a different track for adoptive parents.\"\n\nMoving through the process would be quicker if the family was open to adopting an African-American (not biracial) child, the social worker explained to her. \"And that is because they have children of color waiting,\" Lantz says. Adopting biracial, Latino, Asian or Caucasian children could be a slower process, she was told, because there were more parents waiting for them.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Caryn Lantz Courtesy of Caryn Lantz\n\n\"And I remember hearing this and just sort of being dumbfounded that they would sort of segregate \u2014 to use a loaded term \u2014 segregate these children by ethnic background before they were even in this world,\" Lantz says. \"That's when I started realizing that, OK, being a parent to a child of a different ethnic background \u2014 this is gonna be some work. There's going to be a lot of work on our end in order to be successful parents and to get our child ready for this world.\"\n\nThe Race Card Project spoke with social workers, adoption agencies and adoptive parents about adoption costs based on ethnicity. We discovered that this is not widely talked about, but it is common, Norris tells NPR's David Greene. \"No one is comfortable about this.\"\n\nNon-white children, and black children, in particular, are harder to place in adoptive homes, Norris says. So the cost is adjusted to provide an incentive for families that might otherwise be locked out of adoption due to cost, as well as \"for families who really have to, maybe have a little bit of prodding to think about adopting across racial lines.\"\n\nIn other words, Norris explains, there are often altruistic reasons for the discrepancy \u2014 \"but people who work in adoption say there's one more reason, quite simply: It's supply and demand.\"\n\nThe fees typically cover administrative costs, but also costs associated with taking care of the mother, like travel, rent, health care and counseling services. Now, some states and agencies are using a different formula to make adoption more affordable for families, with a sliding scale based on income rather than skin color. In that system, lower-income families pay less to adopt. Some agencies are also moving toward a uniform cost system where all adoptive parents would pay the same fees.\n\nUltimately, the Lantz family adopted their sons from Nevada, where the sliding scale was based on income, not race. But because they were eager to find a child, they did consider agencies that used a race-based cost differential.\n\nDuring the process, the family received four calls about potential children to be matched with them \u2014 three from states that used this race-based cost structure. \"One was a full African-American child, one was a biracial child and one was a white child,\" Lantz says. \"And when they told me the fees for the white child, I was in a Babies R Us [store] and I remember having to sit down in the aisle and say to myself, 'I don't think we can afford to adopt this child if the expectant mother chose us.' \"\n\nThe cost to adopt the Caucasian child was approximately $35,000, plus some legal expenses. \"Versus when we got the first phone call about a little girl, a full African-American girl, it was about $18,000,\" Lantz says. The cost for adoption of a biracial child was between $24,000 and $26,000.\n\nEyes do linger on her blended family in her community, Lantz says, and curious people make comments. Two years ago, before she had a second son, she started growing concerned about the effect those comments might have on her son as he grows older.\n\n\"I am a little nervous about what we're gonna do when he starts to understand why someone approached us at Target and thanked us for saving babies,\" she explained at the time. \"Or when a woman, you know, walks down the aisle of the grocery store and says, 'What's he mixed with?' \"\n\nLantz responded to that incident, she recalls, by saying, \"My son, we adopted him at birth. And, you know, his ethnic background is a little different. And we don't know a whole bunch about it, but he is a beautiful kid, isn't he?\"\n\n'White Parents Raise Beautifully Diverse Children'\n\nThat six-word submission to The Race Card Project comes from Louise Bannon of Holly Springs, N.C. Bannon and her husband Greg, both white, have two sons: Darius, Bannon's biological son, who is biracial, and Bryce, who is adopted and African-American.
