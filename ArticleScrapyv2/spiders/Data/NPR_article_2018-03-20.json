I have received assurances that his firing is not even under consideration.\"\n\nThe speaker did not say who has offered him such assurances, but his view is widely held among congressional Republicans that President Trump will not attempt to fire Mueller. Fears of White House meddling were stoked over the weekend after the late Friday firing of outgoing FBI official Andrew McCabe and a series of presidential tweets, some attacking Mueller by name.\n\nRepublicans largely downplayed those concerns but, at the same time, offered support for Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I agree with the president's lawyers that Bob Mueller should be allowed to finish his job. I believe it was an excellent appointment, and he should be allowed to go where the facts lead him, \" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday, before adding, \"I don't think Bob Mueller is going anywhere.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that the president knows that any effort to end Mueller's investigation could be considered an impeachable offense.\n\n\"I can't think of a more upsetting moment in the rule of law to have an investigator looking at a president's campaign as to whether or not they colluded with a foreign government, what kind of crimes may have been committed,\" Graham said, \"I've seen no evidence of collusion, but to stop the investigation without cause, I think, would be a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nOther top Republicans, including House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have all publicly warned the White House since the weekend to cool it on Mueller. Hatch went so far to say that firing Mueller would be \"the stupidest thing\" Trump could do.\n\nRetiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a frequent Trump critic, said it was incumbent upon all Republicans to make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line that can't be crossed. Republicans have generally avoided direct criticism of the president. \"If you're going to pick a fight, this is a fight to pick. You've got to pick this fight. If you don't pick this fight, we might as well not be here. This is a serious one,\" Flake said.\n\nHe was less confident than most of his Republican colleagues that Trump can be trusted to leave the special counsel alone. \"Just a week ago he said he wasn't firing Tillerson, too. I think pre-emptively it would behoove our leadership to be forceful and say, 'This is a line you cannot cross,' \" Flake said.\n\nLater Tuesday, Flake appeared to turn up the volume on his concerns. In an evening tweet, referenced impeachment: \"We are begging the president not to fire the special counsel. Don't create a constitutional crisis. Congress cannot preempt such a firing. Our only constitutional remedy is after the fact, through impeachment. ...\" The tweet echoed and crystallized remarks Flake made to the Washington Post.\n\nCongressional leaders are putting the final touches on a $1.3 trillion spending bill that will pass Congress in the coming days. Some Democrats would like to see language included in the must-pass bill to protect Mueller, but GOP leaders have said that is off the table.\n\nNot all Democrats believe legislation is necessary at this time. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters she also believes the president understands how severe the consequences would be if he were to interfere with an independent investigation. \"[Mueller] is protected now. He's working independently now,\" she said, \"I don't believe that there is any cause to terminate him and without cause, it becomes political, and that, I think, would rip apart this administration.\"", "keywords": ["protection", "trump", "firing", "lawmakers", "president", "mueller", "republican", "think", "investigation", "say", "house", "needs", "special", "told", "flake"], "polarity": 0.14060559006211176, "subjectivity": 0.4704192546583852},

She remains one of the most unpopular members of President Trump's Cabinet and continues to anger Democrats over many issues.\n\nRepublicans at the hearing, not surprisingly, were more supportive, praising DeVos for her efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy, her support for charter schools and vouchers, and for her stance that states should decide whether teachers should carry guns.\n\nBut from Democrats, there was criticism \u2014 and scorn.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., started off by taking aim at DeVos' proposed 5 percent cut in education spending for 2019.\n\n\"You are turning your back on public schools,\" DeLauro said. \"You admitted in your interview on 60 Minutes that you have yet to visit a single struggling school and said you support arming teachers, an idea most teachers oppose.\"\n\nDeVos insisted that arming teachers should be left up to the states and local school districts. She said she hasn't visited struggling schools because she is afraid she wouldn't be welcome. She said she has focused instead on schools that are doing innovative things and are more welcoming.\n\nDeLauro piled on the criticisms: \"You stand up for debt collectors rather than college students struggling to pay back loans. You favor reducing government oversight of private, for-profit schools with bad track records. You're undermining sexual assault policies on college campuses.\"\n\nDeVos seemed unruffled, smiling as she tried to get back to a discussion about the budget, especially her push to help low-income parents pay for private school tuition.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, was next: \"Your budget includes over a billion dollars more for school choice,\" she told DeVos. \"But no new money for special education.\"\n\nLowey accused DeVos of not caring that some private schools aren't following federal laws that are supposed to protect children with disabilities.\n\n\"We are working to make sure private schools follow those laws,\" DeVos responded. \"But it's a state matter if a school has its own programs that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not cover or fund.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Lowey interrupted, \"you're saying the feds have no role in making sure parents get services that IDEA calls for? So if parents put a child in a school that does not serve that child, that's OK?\"\n\nDeVos did not respond.\n\nReturning to her budget proposal, the secretary said it has two main goals: first, to make the department more efficient by doing more with less, and, second, to reduce the federal footprint on state and local school reform.\n\nTo that end, DeVos wants to slash the budget, mostly by cutting $2 billion from teacher training and professional development programs. She suggested that school districts could replace that money by taking funds from other federal programs.\n\n\"That's preposterous!\" said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a California Democrat.\n\n\"You're robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" agreed Democrat Barbara Lee, also of California.\n\nLee accused DeVos of rolling back protections for the rights of minority students. She noted DeVos' proposal to reduce funding for the department's Office for Civil Rights and the administration's support for a rollback of Obama-era guidance on racial disparity in suspensions and expulsions.\n\nYears of research show that African-American and Latino students are punished more often and more harshly than white students for the same violations.\n\n\"Do you admit there's racial bias? Yes or no?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"We don't tolerate discrimination,\" DeVos responded. \"The office of civil rights is doing more with less. It's more efficient than before. Our budget protects and encourages minority students. It expands opportunities that target minority low-income students.\"\n\n\"Your head is in the sand,\" Lee retorted. \"You just don't care about civil rights do you?\"\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., came to DeVos' defense.\n\n\"It's shameful that you're being accused of being racist just because people don't agree with you,\" he told her.\n\nOn guns and arming teachers, DeVos had little to add beyond what she has said previously: It's an issue best left to states.\n\nAlthough DeVos went to Florida after the Parkland shooting, Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, wanted to know: \"Will you at least be willing to meet with students from [Marjory] Stoneman Douglas High School, who'll be marching this Saturday in Washington?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" DeVos said. \"But at some other time.\"\n\nTrump has named DeVos to head a new commission on school safety. She told the lawmakers that the panel will examine the \"culture of violence\" in the U.S.\n\nAfter more than two hours of testimony and repeated attacks from Democrats, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., stated the obvious: \"There's a disconnect between you and lawmakers.\"", "keywords": ["private", "school", "rights", "democrats", "federal", "students", "budget", "devos", "teachers", "money", "schools", "grill", "guns"], "polarity": 0.1357936777153195, "subjectivity": 0.41381286209644413},

The shooter, identified by the sheriff as 17-year-old Austin Wyatt Rollins, was confirmed dead after being taken to a hospital.\n\n\"A male student produced a handgun and fired a round, wounding a female student and another male student in a hallway of Great Mills High School just before classes\" began at about 7:55 a.m. Tuesday, St. Mary's County Sheriff Timothy Cameron told reporters at a news conference.\n\nThe two victims have been taken to local hospitals. The male student, 14, is in stable condition, and the female student, 16, is in intensive care with \"life-threatening critical injuries,\" Cameron said.\n\nA school resource officer engaged the shooter after he started firing, quickly containing the situation, Cameron told reporters. Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill \"fired a round at the shooter; simultaneously, the shooter fired a round as well,\" Cameron said. They are investigating whether the officer's rounds struck the shooter; the sheriff added that Gaskill was not injured.\n\nDeputy's troopers and school nursing staff immediately administered first aid, including CPR, to the victims, Cameron said.\n\n\"There is an indication that a prior relationship existed between the shooter and the female victim,\" Cameron added. \"We are working as we speak to determine if that was and, if so, the extent of that and if it was part of the motive for this shooting.\"\n\nFurther information about Rollins was not immediately available. A Facebook page under the name of \"Austin Rollins\" depicted a teenager who attends Great Mills High School and is interested in car racing and kayaking. Within hours of the shooter identification, the page was altered to indicate that Rollins is deceased and much of the information on it is no longer visible.\n\n\"Austin Wyatt Rollins\" was listed in the school's honor roll multiple times, as reported by local media.\n\nWitnesses to the shooting were questioned at a secured area in the high school, the sheriff said.\n\nThe school district said the school was being evacuated and that the rest of the students were taken to Leonardtown High School, where they met up with parents in pouring rain.\n\nThey \"embraced, shared hugs, tears and reassurances,\" as WAMU's Patrick Madden reported from the scene. Among them was 15-year-old Bethany Morgan and her dad, Brian.\n\n\"Everybody just said, 'What was that noise?' and my teacher went out and said somebody was on the floor,\" Morgan told Madden. \"Right in the moment, it was really scary. I don't want to go through it again.\"\n\nGreat Mills High School is located in southern Maryland, about 60 miles southeast of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said their agents are on the scene assisting the sheriff's department.\n\n\"This is what we train for, this is what we prepare for, and this is what we pray we never have to do,\" said the sheriff. \"And on this day, we realize our worst nightmare: that our greatest asset \u2014 our children \u2014 were attacked in one of our places, a bastion of safety and security, one of our schools.\"\n\nAccording to The Bay Net, a southern Maryland news site, authorities investigated potential threats to Great Mills High School last month after reports circulated on social media.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nThe news site said the school principal said in a letter to parents that the school and law enforcement assessed the threat and that it \"has not been validated at this time.\" At Tuesday's press conference, the sheriff said authorities are investigating whether anything on social media is linked to this attack.\n\nThe 17-year-old shooter likely did not have legal authorization to possess the gun. As The Associated Press reported, \"In Maryland, a person must be 21 to possess a handgun, unless carrying one is required for employment.\"\n\nThe shooting comes just over a month after the shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\"That's what we're talking about right now across the country,\" Cameron added. \"The notion of 'it can't happen here' is no longer a notion.\"\n\nLast week, tens of thousands of students from across the country walked out of classrooms to call for firmer action against gun violence. Mass demonstrations are expected this weekend in Washington, D.C., in favor of stricter gun regulations, a protest organized by Parkland shooting survivors.\n\nEmma Gonzalez, a Parkland student who has been outspoken in calling for tighter gun laws, tweeted a message of support for Great Mills students.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement that he was praying for the Great Mills community. \"But prayers are not enough,\" Hogan said. \"Although our pain remains fresh and the facts remain unclear, today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety.\n\n\"Instead, it must serve as a call to action.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., told reporters Tuesday that talks dragged into the night Monday but the bill was nearly complete.\n\n\"There are some unresolved issues,\" Ryan said at a weekly press conference. \"We're working through them as we speak and we hope to post today.\"\n\nThat delay means the Senate would have less than 48 hours to pass a spending bill before the shutdown deadline \u2014 a task that could prove difficult under strict Senate rules that call for lengthy debate on the bill. A single Senator could force a temporary shutdown by objecting to a request to shorten the debate time, as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. did last month.\n\nOne of the biggest squabbles centered on funding for payments to shore up the individual marketplaces covered by the Affordable Care Act. The two parties were at odds over whether insurers could use payments meant to offset the cost of insurance for low-income people to pay for plans that cover abortion.\n\nIt is a complex fight that dragged well into the night Monday. Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., blamed Democrats for stalling the subsidies over a GOP effort to apply a long-standing restriction on federal funding for abortion, known as the Hyde amendment, to the subsidy payments.\n\n\"Suddenly they're trying to turn a 40 percent decrease in health insurance rates into a discussion of extreme abortion language,\" Alexander told reporters Monday. \"It says very simply the federal government can't pay for abortions but anybody else can.\"\n\nAlso at issue is the fate of immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought to the country as children. President Trump announced last year that would rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Courts have delayed the implementation of that order but Democrats say they want Congress to immediately pass legal protections for those immigrants.\n\nBut Democrats are unwilling to swap those protections for $25 billion in funding for Trump's planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The number two Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters Monday that he expects the immigration battle will not be resolved in this spending bill.\n\n\"It sounds like everybody is still where they were on DACA,\" Cornyn said. \"Nobody has really moved.\"\n\nInstead, Democrats appear likely to accept roughly $1.6 billion in border protection funds as part of the spending bill.\n\nLeaders say they hope the issues will be resolved quickly so that the Senate can vote on the measure before the Friday deadline.", "keywords": ["fight", "caught", "senate", "known", "democrats", "funding", "partisan", "health", "reporters", "spending", "bill", "ahead", "deadline", "shutdown", "told"], "polarity": 0.006916099773242633, "subjectivity": 0.4299319727891157},

Texans went to the polls earlier this month, and Illinois \u2014 the only state known to have been successfully hacked leading up to the 2016 election \u2014 is voting on Tuesday.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee's report specifically reacted to Russia's efforts to interfere in U.S. democracy leading up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The Russians were relentless in attempting to meddle in the 2016 elections,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in an intelligence committee press conference unveiling the new recommendations. \"And they will continue their efforts to undermine public confidence in western democracies and in the legitimacy of our elections.\"\n\nIntelligence officials are in agreement that Russia intervened to try to hurt Hillary Clinton and get President Trump elected.\n\nTrump's allies dispute that specific assessment, but Trump did use a press conference earlier this month to acknowledge Russian interference in Western elections. Trump said his administration was \"doing a very very deep study\" with suggestions on improving election security and vowed to \"counteract very strongly\" any interference this year.\n\nAll the same, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she didn't think election interference came up in a phone call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday.\n\nAt their press conference on Capitol Hill, avoided commenting about Trump's leadership on election interference, although they said they hoped the executive branch, Congress and state officials ultimately could work together.\n\n\"Certain issues are non-partisan and this is one of those,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\n\nCyberthreat\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said that Russian-affiliated operatives probed the voting systems of 21 states leading up to the 2016 election, but only successfully broke into those belonging to Illinois. Hackers gained access to the voter registration data of tens of thousands of voters in Illinois but did not alter that data.\n\nNo vote tallies were changed by the Russian cyberattacks, officials say.\n\nIt took DHS almost a year, however, to disseminate that information to the states that were targeted, and to the public \u2014 a delay that frustrated election officials and lawmakers, who argued that they needed that information early to react with enough time before the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee's report includes a recommendation that \"the intelligence community should put a high priority on attributing cyber attacks both quickly and accurately,\" and that DHS should create \"clear channels of communication\" between the federal government and the states.\n\nThe recommendations also ask for the intelligence community to declassify information quickly, as most people in charge of running elections at the local level don't have security clearances to be able to see details about sensitive national security threats.\n\nThe committee's recommendations also point to a huge sticking point in securing elections leading up to voting this November and again in 2020: improving cybersecurity requires bringing on specialized IT staff, updating software, and replacing old outdated technology.\n\nThat takes money.\n\nLegislation to help states cover the cost of improvements has stalled in Congress, but in Tuesday's announcement, senators on the intelligence committee spurred their colleagues to try again.\n\n\"The committee recommends Congress urgently pass legislation increasing assistance,\" the report says.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is scheduled to convene a hearing Wednesday on election security at which representatives from the National Association of State Election Directors, the federal Election Assistance Commissions, and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen are expected to testify.", "keywords": ["trump", "elections", "election", "recommendations", "upgrades", "senate", "funding", "committee", "officials", "urges", "secure", "2018", "intel", "states", "security", "intelligence"], "polarity": 0.15103999175427743, "subjectivity": 0.45600443207586044},

It's winnable,\" the Democratic candidate says of the Illinois 14th Congressional District, which stretches along the western and northern sides of Chicago's outer suburbs.\n\nHer attitude is maybe unremarkable \u2014 every candidate says they're optimistic \u2014 except for the fact that the odds are stacked against her. She knows very well that this race is considered a pretty safe bet for the GOP in November \u2014 the nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists it as a \"likely Republican\" win, meaning Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren has an excellent chance of holding onto his House seat.\n\nStill, Underwood is undeterred.\n\n\"We're not in an average year, and I'm not an average candidate,\" she says. \"I think that that matters. What we've seen in elections out of Virginia and Texas and the special [election] in Pennsylvania is that the candidate and the quality of the election that they're running matters a lot in the election outcome.\"\n\nUnderwood is in good company. This year's unprecedented crop of women running for office includes a glut of women running in races that, to put it mildly, will be a challenge for them to win in November.\n\nLots more women running equals lots more women losing\n\nAn NPR analysis shows that the influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.\n\nIn total, 49 percent of the Democratic women running for the House, Senate, and governor, not including incumbents, are in \"likely\" or \"safe\" Republican races. On the other side, 34 percent of Republican women running as non-incumbents are in likely or safe Democratic House, Senate, or governors' races.\n\nAnd even those running for seats that are within reach for their party will still have to get through sometimes crowded primaries.\n\nThe bottom line is that a wave of female candidates is going to equal a wave of women losing in 2018.\n\nLoading...\n\nImportantly, this doesn't necessarily make women unusual, according to an NPR analysis of the FEC's total candidate dataset. That data isn't perfect \u2014 it includes some candidates who filed but never made it to the ballot, for example \u2014 but it suggests that large numbers of men, particularly Democrats, have filed in districts that would be very difficult to win. Indeed, while the number of women running has increased substantially this year, the level of women as a share of all candidates has not increased all that much.\n\nInterestingly, the districts featuring female candidates followed a similar pattern in the last midterms \u2014 with many Democratic women likewise running in solid Republican districts \u2014 according to data from March 2014 provided to NPR by both the Cook Political Report and Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics, or CAWP.\n\nLoading...\n\nBoth parties have seen increases in female candidates this cycle, though far more of the increase has been among Democratic women, who have been energized by their dislike of President Trump, as well as cultural forces like the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe large number of Democratic female candidates in those \"solid\" and \"likely Republican\" districts may reflect that energy, as women like Underwood hope to unseat staunch conservatives.\n\nTo be clear, the candidate field will narrow considerably in the primaries. Right now, according to the Rutgers data, there are 555 women in the running for 324 U.S. House, Senate or governors' races \u2014 a figure that includes incumbents, challengers and candidates in open races.\n\nBut in November, that wave of women will face its real numbers test.\n\nHow many women could be elected?\n\nOne way to look at the data: If a woman won every possible House race this November, women would occupy 264 House seats \u2014 well over half, and a roughly 150 percent bump from the current level of 106.\n\nBut take out all of those Democratic women in races that Cook considers \"solid\" or \"likely\" Republican and Republican women in \"solid\" or \"likely Democratic\" races, and there would be a potential 162 female House members. And that's potential \u2014 assuming all of those women won.\n\nTo be clear, this still gives women \u2014 particularly Democratic women \u2014 a good chance of picking up significant numbers of seats in November.\n\nToss-up races are one opportunity for this to happen. One easily overshadowed figure in the above charts is the number of women in toss-up races this year \u2014 twice as many GOP women as in 2014, and more than five times as many Democratic women.\n\nSome women will lose, though. And that's OK with Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan group that recruits and trains women to run for office. She says her group is \"coaching women to run to lose\" for a few reasons.\n\n\"One, you might actually win, because this is such a crazy election cycle in 2018,\" Vilardi says. \"No political pundit knows what voter turnout is going to be. Is it going to be 16 points higher [than the last mid-term election]? Eight points higher? Five points higher? We have no idea.\"\n\nIn addition, Vilardi says, a first-time candidate's 2018 campaign could teach them about fundraising and campaigning, not to mention giving them more name recognition, setting them up for an easier campaign in 2020.\n\nRunning a strong campaign in 2018 could also get a candidate more respect and power within her party in advance of future elections, Vilardi adds.\n\n\"Maybe it's also that you go to the party and say, 'If we had 12 people running in this race,' or 'If we had a ticket up and down,' or 'If we had been tending to the Latino population in this community,' or 'I registered 15,000 new Latinos as a part of this campaign' \u2014 those people are only voting for you. You're bringing that body of people with you,\" she says.\n\nOn top of all that, Vilardi adds, new candidates can give more visibility to otherwise ignored issues.\n\nFor now, Underwood has other things on her mind than the long game. She faces off against six other candidates on Tuesday (all of them men) for the Democratic nomination. She knows she's a strong candidate, having outraised all of her opponents who have filed fundraising reports combined, according to FEC data. But she does know that, if she wins, she'll have a much tougher race to run.\n\n\"We're going to need to raise two million dollars in the general,\" she says. \"This will be a challenge.

[Those identifiers] can survive a blast. And they're always there.\n\nThat's why investigators are being so intense and so inclusive about conducting that crime scene. Because they know that one little piece that was found maybe a block away could contain that biometric identifier that leads them to the bomb-maker. ...\n\nNow you have multiple devices, so you have evidence that has been left over or survived on all of them. ... And that will ultimately lead to his being identified.\n\nThe other thing I would say: this is someone that is working at a harried pace, at a very exaggerated pace. And when you see a serial offender doing that, especially with bomb-making, they will make mistakes. So he* can either injure himself or even kill himself when he tries to make the next bomb \u2013 or his mistakes will cause him to be identified.\n\n*Why \"he\"? O'Toole says statistically, it is \"more than likely\" that the bomb-maker targeting the suburbs of Austin is male.\n\nOn the process of piecing together a profile\n\nOne of the first things that investigators will be looking at are the devices, and what remained after they were detonated. How the device was built, and what was used inside it. What were the component parts made out of \u2013 were they available in common, everyday hardware stores? And how were the wires tied? How complicated was the triggering system? So they'll have a lot of information about the skill level of the bomb-maker. ...\n\n[Whoever is behind the Austin bombings] has already killed two people. And after the first murder, he continued to place a bomb in a neighborhood, where the potential for death or major injury was significant. That suggests somebody without compassion, without empathy. Someone that's arrogant in the face of law enforcement. So this is someone that is probably [enjoying] the feeling of power and control \u2013 almost like holding the city of Austin hostage out of fear.\n\nOn the reliability of profiling\n\nIt is common to readjust and reevaluate information as it becomes available. One of the major components, foundations of an FBI profiler, is that you have multiple people who are consulting on the case. That's what they have down in Austin ... because one person may see something that another profiler may not.\n\nNPR's Carol Klinger, Andrea Hsu and Selena Simmons-Duffin produced and edited the audio version of this story.", "keywords": ["serial", "information", "hunt", "available", "suzanne", "forensics", "bombmaker", "clues", "profiler", "thats", "profiling", "capture", "things", "investigators", "austin"], "polarity": 0.012673611111111113, "subjectivity": 0.5020138888888889},

But despite the title, Ehrman asserts that his book doesn't carry a judgment concerning the spread of Christianity.\n\n\"I'm not claiming that it was a great thing that Christianity won; I'm also not saying it was a bad thing,\" he says. \"I'm dealing with it merely as a historian, and I'm saying that Christianity did win, and I point out that this triumph did have obvious good sides and obvious bad sides.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn why conversion was so important to Christians\n\nIt's one of the things that made Christianity quite distinct in the ancient world. It had to do with the nature of the Christian religion. Christians from the very beginning believed that it was Jesus' death and resurrection that could make a person right with God and that if a person was not right with God, they would pay an eternal penalty. There would literally be hell to pay if somebody didn't convert. And so Christians believed that their religion was the only right religion and that people had to practice their religion or else they would go to hell.\n\nMoreover, Christians maintained that they were to follow Jesus' teachings of love. You're to love your neighbor as yourself. Well, if your neighbor is going to go to hell by not believing what you believe, and you love this person, then you need to make them see the error of their ways and convert them to your faith. And so that's what Christians were doing from the very beginning: Trying to convert others so that they could join the church and avoid the terrors of hell.\n\nOn how conversions to Christianity were largely voluntary in the religion's first centuries of existence\n\nI think early in Christianity it was always voluntary. People were simply deciding that the Christian God was the one to be worshipped rather than the traditional pagan gods, and for several centuries it went on like that. We don't actually have records of forcible conversions in the sense that Christians were wielding the sword and forcing pagans to convert. We don't have that kind of thing.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, we do have some Christian intolerance of other religions that was manifest on the political level, where pagan religions became illegal to practice. At that point you ... don't have forced conversions to Christianity; what you do have is enforced illegal religions, so the pagan religions became illegal to practice at one point.\n\nOn why there weren't more Jewish converts\n\nChristianity started out as a group of Jesus-followers, who were all Jewish as he was, who agreed with his teachings, which were Jewish teachings. They believed that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah sent from the Jewish God to the Jewish people in fulfillment of the Jewish scriptures. They were Jewish.\n\nBut this message that they had \u2014 that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah after his death \u2014 simply didn't take among the Jews. Most Jews absolutely rejected the message, and they didn't think it was simply wrong \u2014 they thought it was somewhat ludicrous. Jews who were expecting a Messiah had a variety of understandings of what that Messiah might be, but the various understandings of the Messiah was that the Messiah was going to be a powerful figure who would destroy the enemies of the people of God and set up Israel as a sovereign state in its promised land. He was going to be a powerful warrior political figure.\n\nJesus, on the other hand, was a crucified criminal who is executed for crimes against the state. To call Jesus the Messiah struck most Jews as completely crazy. ... So most Jews simply didn't accept the Christian message, and early on at least, were quite opposed to it.\n\nOn paganism\n\nThe term \"pagan\" when used by a historian is not a derogatory term. There's nothing negative about it. The term pagan is simply used by historians to refer to anybody who followed any of the traditional religions of antiquity, all of which were polytheistic.\n\nThese religions were quite diverse. There were hundreds, thousands of pagan religions and in some ways it's really not fair to lump them all together and call them a thing, so that paganism in a sense is something that we've constructed out of everything that wasn't either Jewish or Christian. ...\n\nThey emphasized practices rather than beliefs, so what mattered were saying prayers and performing sacrifices, and the gods were worshipped not because of an afterlife, but because of what the gods could provide in this life. The gods can control the weather, they can make sure the crops grow and that the livestocks multiply. They can heal the sick. They can take care of people by providing them with things that people can't provide for themselves. And so all of these various religions are doing this in a variety of ways, worshipping a variety of gods, but they do seem to have these common features.\n\nOn why pagans converted to Christianity\n\nWhy would somebody give up religious practices that had been going on in their family for generations, millennia, in order to follow a new religion? The answer seems to be that the Christians were meeting the pagans on their own grounds. The reason pagans were worshipping their gods is because the gods could provide them with things that they could not provide for themselves. It was all about divine power. We can't control if it rains. We can't control if the livestock reproduce. We can't control what happens when we get sick. We can't make ourselves well, but the gods can.\n\nWhat the Christians argued was that the Christian God was more powerful than any other god, that this God was active in the world. He not only brought salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus, he continues to act in the lives of his followers. He heals the sick. He casts out demons. He raises the dead. This God is very active and he is more powerful than any of the others, and so it came to be a competition between the gods, where the Christians were trying to convince people that their God was the superior one.\n\nPhyllis Myers and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

But Dan Margulis, an advertising professional with a personal interest in immigration issues, decided to use the concept for a kind of social experiment along Detroit's St. Patrick's Day Parade route \u2014 and there was no friendly welcome involved.\n\nInspired by the political debate surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Margulis pulled together a group of friends in just three days to create and document the \"No Irish Pub,\" which operated for a handful of hours on March 11th, the day of the St. Patrick's Day Parade, without actually serving a single drink. Instead, a bouncer, portrayed by local contractor Bill Johns, sat on a stool outside the building and turned would-be patrons away based on two criteria: being Irish or simply wearing green to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. A video produced by Atlas Industries is now garnering national attention from people on differing sides of the immigration issue.\n\n\"St. Patrick's Day is the one day that everyone becomes Irish,\" says Margulis, \"so it made sense to use it as a way to humanize the immigrant debate. It's also a day that everyone really wants to get into a bar, so by not letting people get in, it seemed like a way to encourage empathy.\"\n\nThe temporary \"pub\" was sandwiched between two of Detroit's most popular Irish bars in the Corktown neighborhood \u2014 so named for the immigrants from County Cork, Ireland, who populated the area in the mid-19th century. The idea was conceived as a way to highlight how current anti-immigration sentiment echoes the slurs used against Irish immigrants as they began to arrive by the millions in the United States following Ireland's potato famine in the 1840s. The exterior walls were decorated with historical anti-Irish signage such as \"Help Wanted: No Irish Need Apply.\"\n\n\"We chose to make it a 'pub' over a 'bar,'\" says Margulis, \"because a pub has nostalgia, it transports you across oceans. It has warmth and is an inviting space. Bill [Johns] had the most difficult part, though, because he was the one who had to tell people they couldn't come in, and he's actually a really nice guy.\"\n\nBeing confrontational with a bunch of strangers was not easy for Johns, who found some Dutch courage in a couple of shots of whiskey before taking his post at the front door. It was also a lesson in history that he wasn't too familiar with himself \u2014 that Irish immigrants were frequently maligned by Americans for being dirty, dishonest and drunk. After a crash course in anti-Irish statements pulled directly from period newspapers and posters, Johns began to draw attention to the No Irish Pub by calling out offers of \"$2 shots of Jack Daniels' American whiskey,\" to emphasize a preference for American over Irish whiskey. When potential customers tried to enter the pub, Johns would turn them away, saying, \"This is an elite establishment, we don't associate with lower class citizens,\" or \"Why would you want to associate yourself with a simian race?\"\n\nFor people who were particularly confused, and even hurt, by their engagement with Johns at the door of the pub, he provided a flyer that explained the experiment.\n\n\"I made one girl cry,\" says Johns, \"and that didn't feel real good. Her friends said I was a horrible person. But there were a lot of people who came back twenty minutes later and said quietly, 'I love the message, this is awesome.'\"\n\nMargulis particularly wanted to highlight that the Irish were not always welcome in America.\n\n\"The goal was to target people of white European descent, because I think that if you're in America and you're brown, you might be a little closer to the immigration experience now,\" he says. \"We wanted to get people who don't feel personally attached to the cause of the dreamers and say, 'If you just rewind history a little bit, this was your family's story, too.' The holiday is about frivolity and celebration but also provided an opportunity for depth and introspection.\"\n\nFor Johns, one of the most difficult moments of the day came when an older man came to the door, dressed in green from head to toe. \"I asked him if he was Irish,\" recalls Johns, \"and he said in a full Irish accent that he was 100 percent Irish. So I said, 'Then go back to Ireland, nobody wants you here.' He was looking at the signs in the window with a lot of confusion and then he just put his head down and walked away. I felt so bad, I got off the stool and tried to catch up with him to give him one of the flyers explaining what we were doing, but he kept walking too fast. That was really hard, to see how it affected him.\"\n\nWhen Johns told one young woman with a group of Irish friends that she couldn't enter the pub because she was wearing green, she actually removed her green socks and other accessories so she could go inside, leaving her Irish companions to wait for her on the sidewalk. Once inside, she found out that there was actually no bar or even American whiskey, but still hung out with the production crew and took some pictures.\n\nSince the video of the No Irish Pub was released on St. Patrick's Day, Margulis has been flooded with comments from people with opinions on both sides of the issue. \"I feel like it's allowed people to reconnect to something that they haven't thought about for a while,\" he says. \"The way their ancestors suffered becomes a point of pride, so we're getting people who are sharing stories \u2014 not just Irish, but Germans, Italians and others. It's about starting a conversation.\"\n\nKristen Hartke is a food writer based in Washington, D.C.", "keywords": ["st", "youre", "kiss", "green", "detroit", "whiskey", "revelers", "day", "way", "irish", "johns", "patricks", "margulis", "pub", "experiment"], "polarity": 0.030976364904936337, "subjectivity": 0.3294174079888366},

Why Do Adults Avoid Shots?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Cultura RF Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Cultura RF\n\nFederal officials have recommended a vaccine against shingles that is more effective than an earlier version at protecting older adults from the painful rash. But persuading many adults to get this and other recommended shots continues to be an uphill battle, health providers say.\n\n\"I'm healthy; I'll get that when I'm older\" is what adult patients often tell Dr. Michael Munger when he brings up an annual flu shot or a tetanus-diphtheria booster or the new shingles vaccine. Sometimes, he says, they put him off by questioning a vaccine's effectiveness.\n\nMunger, a family physician in Overland Park, Kan., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says he gets more pushback from adults about getting their own vaccines than about immunizing their children.\n\n\"As parents, we want to make sure our kids are protected. But as adults, we act as if we're invincible.\"\n\nThe new schedule for adult vaccines for people age 19 and older has been updated in the last several months by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The most significant change was to recommend Shingrix, the shingles vaccine that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last fall, over an older version of the vaccine.\n\nShingrix should be given in two doses between two and six months apart to adults who are at least 50 years old, the CDC says. The older vaccine, Zostavax, can still be given to adults who are 60 or older, but Shingrix is preferred, according to the agency.\n\nIn clinical trials, Shingrix was 96.6 percent effective in adults ages 50 to 59, while Zostavax was 70 percent effective. The differences were even more striking in older age groups: Effectiveness in adults 70 and older was 91.3 percent for Shingrix, compared with 38 percent for Zostavax.\n\nShingrix also provided longer-lasting protection than Zostavax; the older vaccine's effectiveness waned after the first year.\n\nThe CDC's guidelines suggest that people who have already had the Zostavax shot be revaccinated with Shingrix.\n\nThe two-shot series of Shingrix costs about $280, while Zostavax runs $213.\n\n\"What's remarkable [about the new vaccine] is that the high level of immunity persists even in the very old,\" says Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, a neurologist at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital who studies the complications that can arise with shingles.\n\nShingles is caused by the same varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. The virus can re-emerge decades after a recovery from chickenpox, often causing a painful rash that may burn or itch for weeks before it subsides.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 Americans will get shingles during their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; there are roughly 1 million cases every year. People are more likely to develop shingles as they age, as well as develop complications like postherpetic neuralgia, which can cause severe, long-standing pain after the shingles rash has disappeared. In rare cases, shingles can lead to blindness, hearing loss or death.\n\nAlthough shingles vaccination rates have inched upward in recent years, only a third of adults who were 60 or older in 2016 had received the Zostavax vaccine, the CDC says.\n\nMany adults seem to skipping other recommended vaccines, too. Typically, about 45 percent get the annual flu shot, and only 23 percent of those the CDC says should get the pneumococcal and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccines are up-to-date with those immunizations.\n\nIn contrast, by the time children are 3 years old, typically more than 80 percent (and more than 90 percent, in the case of some vaccines) have received recommended immunizations.\n\nWhy the discrepancy between kids and grown-ups? Cost can be a big deterrent for adults who are considering some vaccinations. The federal Vaccines for Children Program helps parents whose kids are eligible for Medicaid or are uninsured cover the cost of vaccines up to age 19.\n\nAdults with private insurance who get vaccines recommended by the CDC are sheltered from high costs because (under the Affordable Care Act) the shots must be covered by most commercial plans without charging consumers anything out-of-pocket.\n\nStill, patients, should confirm their coverage before requesting the new shingles vaccine, health care providers say; insurers typically add new vaccines gradually to their formularies after they have been added to the recommended list. So some consumers may need to wait a little while before their insurer covers Shingrix.\n\nVaccine coverage under the Medicare program for people age 65 and older tends to be much less comprehensive. Vaccines to prevent influenza and pneumonia are covered without a copayment under Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient care, while other vaccines \u2014 including the shingles vaccine \u2014 are typically covered under Part D drug plans. And those Part D plans may leave some beneficiaries on the hook for all or part of the cost of the two-shot series.\n\nThat can pose a significant problem for patients.\n\n\"Not every Medicare beneficiary elects Part D, and even if you do, some have deductibles and copayments,\" says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nAnd even if adults want to get their recommended shots, some lose track of which they have already received and when. Pediatricians routinely report the vaccines they provide to state or city vaccination registries that electronically collect and consolidate the information. But the registries are not widely used for adults, who are more likely to get vaccines at various locations, such as a pharmacy or at work, for example.\n\n\"I'm always asking patients, 'Did you get all the doses in the series?' 'Where did you get them?' \" says Dr. Laura Riley, vice chairwoman of obstetrics at Boston's Mass General Hospital, and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. \"It can be very challenging to track.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

And he confirmed that he had also been told about a second suspicious package in the FedEx system on Tuesday.\n\nFedEx says, \"The individual responsible also shipped a second package that has now been secured and turned over to law enforcement.\"\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday evening, the Austin Police Department (APD), the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) released more details about the second package found today.\n\n\"Later that morning, at approximately 6:19 a.m., APD received a call regarding a suspicious package at 4117 McKinney Falls Parkway in Austin. APD, along with the FBI and the ATF, responded. It was determined the package contained an explosive device and was disrupted by law enforcement. No injuries were reported.\"\n\nOfficials say the package that exploded may have come from an address on Brodie Lane that houses a FedEx Office printing and shipping office, part of the large Sunset Valley Shopping Center, southwest of downtown Austin. The Sunset Valley Police Department says:\n\n\"The FBI is currently investigating a confirmed link between packages involved in the Austin bombing investigation and a mail delivery office in Sunset Valley. It appears that the source of the suspect packages was a private package delivery office in Sunset Valley.\"\n\nAfter the latest in a string of bombings focusing on Austin, FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee said, \"We believe that the explosion is likely connected\" to those earlier blasts.\n\nHours after the blast near San Antonio, Austin police headed to the scene of a suspicious package that was reported at 4107 McKinney Falls Road \u2014 an address that corresponds to a FedEx Ground facility in Austin. The city's fire department said a hazmat team was there to help with the investigation.\n\nIn a midday update on the situation at McKinney Falls, Austin Senior Police Officer Destiny Winston said that police officers had confirmed a suspicious package there and that the bomb squad was investigating, along with federal agencies.\n\n\"There is an army of law enforcement folks that are here,\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler told NPR's David Greene about the effort to end the bombing threat. \"Hundreds of federal agents, multiple federal agencies, hundreds of agents working on this outside of Austin and Texas.\"\n\nAdler added, \"I'm confident they're going to figure out who's responsible for this and stop it.\"\n\nThe investigation into the Schertz blast was slowed by the need to ensure the FedEx facility was safe, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge James Smith said at a midmorning update.\n\n\"We're going to be here for a little while,\" Smith said.\n\nInvestigators said Monday that a \"serial bomber\" is behind the Austin attacks that have killed two people and injured several others. After a blast on Sunday that was triggered by a tripwire, investigators said the culprit was likely more sophisticated than they had first realized.\n\nInvestigators believe the Austin bombings are related, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said, \"because of some of the specific components of these devices. We are sending all of the evidence to the ATF lab in Quantico, and they are conducting all of the post-blast analysis of the evidence that we have recovered.\"\n\nThose experts, Manley said, \"are reconstructing these devices so that they understand what the firing mechanism is\" and what explosive is being used.\n\nPolice have urged Austin residents to report any suspicious packages. The Austin Police Department says it has received a total of 1,257 such calls since March 12 \u2014 including 420 in the 24 hours between 8 a.m. Monday and 8 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"I want to continue to remind our community to pay close attention to any suspicious device,\" Manley said Tuesday, \"whether it be a package, a bag, a backpack or anything that looks out of place, do not approach it.\"\n\nThe bombings have raised the question of whether the case can be more accurately seen as domestic terrorism or a hate crime \u2014 in part because the first victims of the bombs were people of color, including two black men who were killed.\n\nWhen asked how he sees the case, Adler said, \"I certainly know there is significant fear and terror being felt by people in the community.\" He added that law enforcement is approaching the bombings with an open mind and exploring every possibility.\n\nIt seems that Tuesday's explosion was not as dangerous as it might have been had it reached its target.\n\n\"[T]he package was moving from an elevated conveyor belt to a lower section when it exploded,\" reports CBS Austin.\n\nThe package \"contained shrapnel consisting of nails and pieces of metal, sources said,\" according to the CBS affiliate, which said the Schertz facility has 75 employees.\n\nFedEx released a statement about the blast in Schertz:\n\n\"FedEx has confirmed that a package detonated at a San Antonio FedEx Ground facility early this morning. We have also confirmed that the individual responsible also shipped a second package that has now been secured and turned over to law enforcement. We are thankful that there were no serious injuries from this criminal activity. We have provided law enforcement responsible for this investigation extensive evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them collected from our advanced technology security systems. The safety and security measures in place across the FedEx networks are designed to protect the safety of our people, customers and communities, and to assist law enforcement as appropriate.\"\n\nThe Texas bombing case now includes hundreds of law enforcement agents from local police, the FBI and ATF, as well as a reward of up to $100,000.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

In a statement, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy said that his condition worsened and that he was no longer able to stand up, so his veterinary team decided to euthanize him.\n\nSudan was captured in Sudan in 1975, when he was just 2 years old, and was taken to Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in the Czech Republic. But as that zoo fell into financial troubles and rhinos failed to breed, Sudan was relocated in 2009 to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Laikipia County, Kenya, along with two northern white rhino females named Najin and Fatu.\n\nThe thinking was that in a place closely resembling their homeland, they would thrive. Northern white rhinos used to be found in an area spanning Uganda, Chad, southwestern Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some 2,000 existed in 1960, according to the World Wildlife Fund, but war and the poaching that funded the fighting drove them to extinction in the wild.\n\nJoseph Thaida, who took care of Sudan at the conservancy since 2012, remembers him as an affectionate and gentle rhino who had his picture taken with tourists and served as the centerpiece of publicity stunts. The most famous was when Sudan got his own Tinder profile last year to bring attention to the plight of his subspecies and to direct donations to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for research on assisted reproductive technologies for rhinos.\n\n\"Whenever he hears people talking, he loves to come close, because he knows he's gonna be scratched,\" Thaida told NPR last year.\n\nThaida remembered when Sudan arrived at the conservancy, watching him as he studied the southern white rhinos already there. Sudan learned how to sharpen his horn using a tree. He began to graze and wallow in mud like his genetic cousins.\n\nAfter years in captivity, Sudan finally learned to become a rhino at this conservancy, Thaida believed. But he and the two females never reproduced.\n\nDr. Steve Ngulu, the veterinarian who was in charge of Sudan, said the animal's death is sad and shocking \u2014 and a testament to human failure.\n\n\"But then, as far as their propagation is concerned, we are happy that at least we collected some sperm from him and the other males,\" Ngulu said.\n\nOne of the huge hurdles facing scientists is that the two remaining female northern white rhinos cannot gestate the next generation \u2014 one is sterile and the other is not physically capable of carrying a calf to full term.\n\n\"So, natural reproduction cannot take place, artificial insemination is not possible, so the only other option that we have to have a pure northern white rhino baby is to retrieve or to do something we call ovum pick-up, collect eggs from the females,\" Ngulu said.\n\nThose fertilized eggs would then be implanted in a southern white rhino, who would carry the calf to term. Taking eggs from a rhino, though, has never been done. If and when scientists take that risk, there is a chance that the females could perish \u2014 bringing the species to extinction.", "keywords": ["scientists", "females", "white", "male", "rhinos", "rhino", "sudan", "republic", "conservancy", "thaida", "northern", "worlds", "dies"], "polarity": 0.02967205750224619, "subjectivity": 0.39166666666666666},

Light pours into the small room from a window framed by antlers, harvested from the surrounding central Wisconsin woods. On the opposite wall is a collage of fading photos, showing how big the hunting parties out here used to be.\n\n\"I try to keep the tradition alive,\" Wrasse says, looking at the photos over a cup of coffee. \"But no, they've all gone their separate ways.\"\n\nIn rural Wisconsin, the passion for hunting still appears to burn as bright as the blaze orange jackets you'll see stalking through fields or clambering up into trees during deer season. But stop into a meat processing center or a sporting goods store, ask about it at a bar or a hunting shack and you'll hear from people like Wrasse: Fewer people are hunting. \"It's just kind of fading away,\" he says.\n\nA new survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that today, only about 5 percent of Americans, 16 years old and older, actually hunt. That's half of what it was 50 years ago and the decline is expected to accelerate over the next decade.\n\nLoading...\n\nMeanwhile other wildlife-centered activities, like birdwatching, hiking and photography, are rapidly growing, as American society and attitudes towards wildlife change.\n\nThe shift is being welcomed by some who morally oppose the sport, but it's also leading to a crisis.\n\nState wildlife agencies and the country's wildlife conservation system are heavily dependent on sportsmen for funding. Money generated from license fees and excise taxes on guns, ammunition and angling equipment provide about 60 percent of the funding for state wildlife agencies, which manage most of the wildlife in the U.S.\n\nThis user-play, user-pay funding system for wildlife conservation has been lauded and emulated around the world. It has been incredibly successful at restoring the populations of North American game animals, some of which were once hunted nearly to extinction.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nBut with the slide in hunting participation expected to speed up in the next 10 years, widening funding shortfalls that already exist, there's a growing sense of urgency in the wildlife conservation community to broaden that funding base. Congress is looking at tapping oil and gas revenues. Some states are adding general sales taxes, while others are looking for ways to tweak the user-play, user-pay model to better represent how today's society interacts with wildlife, monetizing activities like wildlife-viewing.\n\nThose efforts are running into a larger question: Is the greater public willing to pay more to protect wildlife?\n\n\"Conservationists need to be looking at what is the next step to keep our conservation programs and places strong and healthy,\" says Mary Jean Huston, director of The Nature Conservancy in Wisconsin. \"Things need to evolve.\"\n\nAnd they need to evolve fast.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a lack of funding has prompted the state's Department of Natural Resources to leave staff positions unfilled and cut back on habitat management. Colorado's wildlife agency has cut tens of millions of dollars in expenditures and trimmed programs that deal with invasive species. Vermont's fish and wildlife department, which manages more than 25,000 species and nearly 2,000 native plants, is cautioning that even though the state leads the nation in wildlife viewing, that activity \"provides no significant revenue stream to the department that would allow for the management of the resources viewed.\"\n\nA panel on sustaining America's fish and wildlife resources recently warned: \"Without a change in the way we finance fish and wildlife conservation, we can expect the list of federally threatened and endangered species to grow from nearly 1,600 species today to perhaps thousands more in the future.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nate Rott/NPR Nate Rott/NPR\n\nA demographic wall\n\nIn 1992, Tom Heberlein, a rural sociologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, made a bold prediction: If sociological trends, like increasing urbanization, smaller family sizes and growing anti-hunting sentiment continued, the sport of hunting \u2013 as Wisconsinites knew it \u2013 could be extinct by the year 2050.\n\nA quarter century later, Keith Warnke, the hunting and shooting sports coordinator for the state of Wisconsin, sits at his desk in downtown Madison looking at a graph of recent hunter data.\n\n\"It's just striking how close demographers were in their estimates to the actual hunter numbers,\" he says.\n\nWarnke is a \"recovering biologist,\" as he puts it, so he collects hunter data and demographics \u2013 age, gender, location, etc. \u2013 with the same detailed focus that he used to apply to tracking deer populations. Only now, he uses unique identification numbers instead of ear tags.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nAnd while he does not believe that hunters will go extinct in the next few decades \u2013 or ever, for that matter \u2013 he does know a steeper decline in hunting participation is coming, as Heberlein predicted.\n\nIncreased urbanization, restricted access to huntable areas, lack of free time, and the rise of Netflix, video games and all-consuming youth sports are all dropping hunter numbers, but the most-pressing challenge is one that Warnke and others can't do anything about.\n\n\"We're up against a demography wall,\" Warnke says. \"A wall of demographics when the number of hunters is really going to decline.\"\n\nThat wall is an age. Sixty-five. That's when the average hunter stops buying licenses and picking up their rifle, Warnke says.\n\nFor many hunters in Wisconsin and around the U.S., that wall is rapidly approaching.\n\nNearly a third of all hunters in the U.S. are baby boomers. They hunted like no other generation since. But the oldest Boomers are already aging out of the sport and the youngest, at 54, are only about a decade away from joining them.\n\nThis visualization by Dr. Loren Chase with the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife shows the age demographics of hunters through time. Each column represents the percent of the U.S. population that hunts in different age groups from 1992 to 2012. Dr. Loren Chase, Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife YouTube\n\nWhen put on a timeline, that cohort of older hunters looks like a wave, moving through time, that drops as it hits the age of 65.\n\n\"What that means is the way that conservation was done in the past is not going to be sufficient in the future,\" says Randy Stark, the former chief game warden for Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources, or DNR.\n\nLinking hunting to conservation\n\nTo understand the connection between hunting and conservation, you need to go back to when deer and geese weren't viewed a public nuisance, but as the rare wildlife they were.\n\nIn the late 1800s, American wildlife was in a bad place. Market hunting, trapping, invasive species and American's rapid expansion westward had pushed many wildlife species to the brink.\n\nAll of this over-hunting got the attention of a couple of other hunters \u2013 one who would go on to found the Audubon Society, another who would become the 26th and youngest president of the United States.\n\nGeorge Bird Grinnell and Theodore Roosevelt, along with others like John Muir and Gifford Pinchot, helped establish the American conservation movement around the idea that wildlife and other natural resources, belong to all Americans \u2013 current and future. As such, they needed to be preserved or conserved.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nRoosevelt proposed the idea of \"conservation through wise use,\" and started pushing his fellow hunters to help pay for that conservation.\n\nLicenses or permits for hunting already existed. New York sold the first permit to hunt deer in 1864. Under Roosevelt though, the practice spread and license fees became a source of revenue for states.\n\nThen, in 1937, legislation was passed that linked the financing for wildlife conservation to hunting in a way we're still seeing today.\n\n\"Nobody could anticipate 100 years later what society would look like,\" Stark says. \"In some ways the way that conservation was funded and conceived in its early years contributes to the problem we have now.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, or the Pittman-Robertson Act, as it's more commonly known, requires that states use their revenues from hunting license fees for wildlife management. It also took an existing 11 percent excise tax on guns and ammunition and directed that money to state wildlife agencies for wildlife restoration and protection. A similar act was later passed to tax angling equipment.\n\nMore than $19 billion has since been apportioned to state wildlife agencies from funds generated by those taxes.\n\nWith gun sales surging in recent years, that pool of money has actually grown. People in the hunting world joke that former president Barack Obama was the greatest conservationist since Roosevelt, because of the record gun sales during his presidency.\n\nBut there's a catch.\n\nTightening belts\n\nTo access those federally apportioned funds, states have to pony up some of their own matching money - 25 percent or more of the total they're looking to get back. No match, no money.\n\n\"With decreases in license sales, we're getting to the point as a state agency that we're struggling to match those funds,\" says Eric Lobner, the head of the wildlife division for Wisconsin's DNR.\n\nMany states have increased license fees for out-of-state hunters to compensate for the decrease in license sales, but Lobner says there's only so far you can raise fees before you start pricing people out.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nAt the same time, he says, the cost of doing business is going up and the demands on his agency are growing. Climate change and development are threatening more species. The public wants protections for animals that it used to not care about. The combination is creating a crunch.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit conservation organization, says that current funding levels for national wildlife conservation are \"less than 5 percent of what is necessary.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, Lobner says, they've had to cut 16 positions in their program because of budget shortfalls over the last four years - people who would have been managing wildlife and habitat. Open positions are staying vacant longer. Programs and services are being scaled back.\n\nIn a report to the Wisconsin legislature's Joint Committee on Finance, the DNR listed several ongoing or potential reductions due to insufficient funds, including fewer game warden patrols, less habitat management, fewer fish surveys and 2,000 acres of shallow wetlands that are being left unmanaged.\n\nWetlands that, as Lobner points out, don't just serve as wildlife habitat but also help to purify the state's drinking water.\n\n\"These are resources that the public wants,\" Lobner says. \"We've been hearing they want to see waterfowl, they want to see deer, they want to see bear, whatever the species it is. They want those resources at their disposal.\"\n\nThe question is: Are they willing to pay for them?\n\nHunting for more funding\n\nPublic support for hunting remains high across the country, even with fewer people participating. Public support for wildlife conservation is even higher.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Wisconsin residents - Republicans, Democrats and Independents - agree that money should be invested in protecting land, water and wildlife even when the state's budget is tight, according to a poll commissioned by the state's chapter of The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNationally, 74 percent of Americans believe the country should \"do whatever it takes to protect the environment,\" according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBut in most cases outside of hunting and fishing, that's not being translated into dollars.\n\nPhilanthropy and nonprofits have certainly stepped up to try and fill the void, bringing in money for habitat purchases and management. A few states have passed sales taxes to help fund conservation. Others have tapped lottery ticket sales or started selling specialty license plates.\n\nEven Congress is looking for a solution. Legislation, introduced late last year, would redirect revenues from energy and mineral development on federal lands to state wildlife programs. The proposal has bipartisan support, but similar efforts to secure wider funding have failed in the past.\n\nSo in most cases, state wildlife agencies like Wisconsin's are going back to the hand that feeds them, doubling down on hunters with programs to retain old hunters, reactivate those who have quit the sport and to recruit new hunters.\n\nFor the latter, state wildlife agencies are increasingly looking for new hunters that don't fit the traditional mold by advertising in urban areas, opening stands at farmers markets and staffing community events. In Wisconsin, they're offering free classes on college campuses, teaching hunter's safety and hands on butchering clinics, with the goal of capitalizing on the locavore movement and a renewed interest in wild meat.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nThese efforts are having success, Warnke says, particularly in recruiting women to the sport.\n\n\"But when you look overall, our small group isn't going to change the trend,\" says Jim Wipperfurth, a volunteer for Wisconsin's DNR who leads recruitment hunts. \"There's just so many factors involved, it's hard to just change it.\"\n\nThis pains Wipperfurth and other hunters to say. It's not just the loss of a sport or a revenue source they're trying to stop, but the loss of a tradition and a connection to the natural world, Wipperfurth says.\n\n\"Who goes and sits in the woods all day except hunters?\" Wipperfurth says. \"If hunting didn't exist, who'd know that the squirrel population is down, that a windstorm knocked all these trees down - who'd know all of that stuff? Because we're the ones out here seeing all of it.\"\n\nThe latest numbers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service show that 86 million Americans participated in wildlife watching in 2016. That was a 20 percent increase from just five years previous. The number of people enjoying outdoor recreation is increasing as well.\n\n\"We need to find ways for the rest of those folks, who are canoeing and cross country skiing and biking and going to the park to contribute as well,\" Huston says.\n\nThere have been efforts to tax outdoor equipment like sleeping bags, tents and binoculars. Some in the wildlife management world joke about an \"REI Tax,\" a reference to the chic outdoor retailer.\n\nThose efforts have failed though, in large part because of opposition from the outdoor industry, which argues that it already pays billions of dollars in taxes through import tariffs. That revenue should be used to adequately fund conservation, says the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group that represents retailers like Patagonia and The North Face.\n\nThe arguments about funding for conservation can quickly grow divisive. Hunters are quick to write off other outdoor recreationists as hippies and \"free riders.\" Wildlife advocates are quick to paint hunters as hillbillies, clinging to an outdated tradition. But many people are in the middle.\n\n\"Wildlife conservation has been at its strongest when hunters and non-hunters are allied together for wildlife,\" says Adena Rissman, an associate professor of forest and wildlife ecology at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nThe passage of the Lacey Act, the nation's first - and perhaps most powerful - wildlife protection law is a good example, Rissman says. It prohibits the trade of wildlife, fish and plants that have been taken illegally.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR\n\nThat act, Rissman says, was galvanized not just by hunters, but by affluent women's groups that had grown concerned about the millinery trade's impact on bird populations. Feathered hats were in fashion in the late 19th century and hunters were killing millions of birds annually, wiping out entire colonies, to feed the demand. Sport hunters, angry about the sorry state of their quarry, were equally concerned. Together, they helped push lawmakers to a legislative solution.\n\nA similar collaborative effort is needed to address the funding issues of today, Rissman says, and she believes that other wildlife lovers are willing to contribute.\n\nAbout 20 miles north of Madison, at a quiet, open wildlife sanctuary, Neal Deunk takes pictures of four lonely geese floating on a tiny patch of open water in an otherwise frozen pond. His telephoto lens juts out from the open driver's side window of his car.\n\nDeunk knows the challenges facing wildlife refuges like this, with the decline in hunting and shrinking revenues. He says he'd like to see lawmakers allocate more general tax money to address the situation. But he also thinks it would be prudent to get other wildlife enthusiasts to contribute more.\n\n\"It's difficult to license birdwatchers or hikers and so forth in the same way that hunting and fishing can be regulated,\" he says, watching as a few of the geese take flight. Asked if he'd be willing to pay a license-fee to view wildlife like this, he pauses. \"I think I would,\" he says.", "keywords": ["wildlife", "decline", "hunters", "state", "threatens", "wisconsin", "funding", "fish", "states", "conservation", "pays", "hunting", "nathan"], "polarity": 0.07465076776735968, "subjectivity": 0.40677382408324125},

Law Challenged By Anti-Abortion Centers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lee Sheehan/NPR Lee Sheehan/NPR\n\nUpdated at 5:34 p.m. ET\n\nSupreme Court justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism Tuesday about California's \"truth-in-advertising\" law requiring anti-abortion clinics to more fully disclose what they are.\n\nThe anti-abortion \"crisis pregnancy centers\" objected to the law on free-speech grounds.\n\nWhile some more liberal justices appeared receptive to the state's case initially, doubt about the law seemed to increase as the argument progressed.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, potentially the swing justice, said the law in certain circumstances would seem to impose an undue burden. He cited a hypothetical example of a billboard in Los Angeles with the words \"Choose Life,\" paid for by an anti-abortion clinic. Under California's law, would the ad have to include, as the statute says, the words about the clinic being unlicensed, in large font and in multiple languages?\n\nYes, it would, said the lawyer for the state. For Kennedy, that seemed to be too much. That, he seemed to say, ended the case for him \u2014 the statute is unconstitutional.\n\nWhat this case is about\n\nThe case before the justices pitted the right to know against the right of free speech. On one side are self-identified \"crisis pregnancy centers\" that seek to prevent abortions, and on the other side is the state of California, which enacted a law to ensure that these centers do not intentionally or unintentionally mislead the women who walk through their doors.\n\nSupporters of the California law call the state's effort nothing more than seeking \"truth in advertising.\" But anti-abortion pregnancy centers see the law as unconstitutional, compelling speech that turns them into mouthpieces for a government message they disagree with.\n\nPassions run high when it comes to abortion. Add the fact that most anti-abortion pregnancy centers have a firm Christian perspective, and you have quite a volatile mix.\n\nNotice requirements for unlicensed and licensed centers\n\nThe case began in 2015 when California passed a law known as the FACT Act. (It stands for Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency.)\n\nThe impetus was two-fold \u2014 first, allegations that pregnancy centers opposed to abortion were using deceptive practices; and second, concern that lower-income women, in particular, weren't aware of the free pregnancy-related services California provides, from pre-natal and delivery care to birth control and abortion.\n\nThe FACT Act requires unlicensed crisis pregnancy centers to post a sign or otherwise disclose to their clients in writing that the center is not a licensed medical facility and has no licensed medical provider who supervises the provision of services. The disclosure requirement extends to advertising, which anti-abortion pregnancy centers object to as an attempt to \"drown out\" their message.\n\nThe state sees the law as a public health measure to ensure that women know when they are entering an unlicensed clinic and that they know the state provides free access for pre-natal and delivery care as well as for contraception and abortion services that clinics opposed to abortion do not provide.\n\nIn contrast, anti-abortion clinics see the California law as unconstitutional because in the case of licensed clinics, it requires them to point patients to clinics that engage in practices they oppose. In addition, they see the declaration of unlicensed status as drowning out their message.\n\nThe second provision of the law, dealing with licensed centers, requires clinics that do not provide a full range of reproductive care, including services covered by Medicaid, to post a sign that says the state provides free or low cost access to pre-natal and delivery care, birth control, and other reproductive care, including abortion.\n\nThe sign is to include the phone number of the county social services office for referrals. But licensed centers do not have to post the notice in their advertising.\n\nSauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nInside the Supreme Court chamber, lawyer Michael Farris, representing the anti-abortion clinics, told the justices that California's law \"took aim at pro-life pregnancy centers by compelling licensed centers to point the way to an abortion and imposing onerous advertising rules on unlicensed centers.\"\n\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor observed that the court has in the past upheld laws enacted by \"pro-life states.\" In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court upheld laws that require doctors to tell women seeking an abortion about alternatives, including telling the pregnant woman that the father of the child would be liable for child support.\n\nAs Justice Elena Kagan put it, \"They're really the exact flip side of the requirements in this case.\"\n\nTherefore, the justices asked, why shouldn't a \"pro-choice state\" require anti-abortion clinics to tell women that there are other options, including contraception and abortion.\n\nFarris said California's law is different, because it involves clinics that provide medical procedures. Justice Samuel Alito asked, what if the state required all clinics to post a referral notice advising patients where they can learn about all their options. Farris said that was still unconstitutional.\n\n\"In law ... what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\" Justice Stephen Breyer observed. \"If a pro-life state can tell a doctor you have to tell people about adoption, why can't a pro-choice state tell a doctor ... you have to tell people about abortion?\"\n\nA \"suspicious pattern\"\n\nThe tone of the argument turned, however, when Justice Kennedy raised his billboard hypothetical. Requiring unlicensed clinics to disclose their status on such billboards, he said, would pose an \"undue burden\" and \"should suffice to invalidate the statute.\"\n\nOther justices seemed to agree, including Justices Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch. Justice Ginsburg noted that the disclosure, which in multi-ethnic Los Angeles is required in 13 different languages, can be \"very burdensome.\"\n\nHowever, Justice Sotomayor also pointed out the advertising practices of some of these unlicensed clinics. She observed that on the Fallbrook Pregnancy Resource Center's website there is \"a woman on the home page with a uniform that looks like a nurse's uniform in front of an ultrasound machine.\"\n\nThe site further states, \"Fallbrook will educate clients about different abortion methods available, and describe in medical terms different abortion procedures.\"\n\nThe website also indicates that Fallbrook follows all HIPAA regulations. \"If they're not a medical provider, they don't have to follow HIPAA,\" noted Justice Sotomayor.\n\nDefending the law, California's deputy Solicitor General Joshua Klein told the justices the law was not targeted at \"pro-life clinics.\" Rather, he said that most general clinics provide Medicaid which, in California, automatically gives women access to free or low-cost reproductive care, including pre-natal care and abortion.\n\nBut Justice Alito pushed back, asking why the law applies only to clinics whose \"primary function is providing service to pregnant women.\" He wanted to know why the law applies only to non-profits and why it exempts individual doctors. \"When you put all this together, you get a very suspicious pattern,\" he said.\n\nIf the argument proved one thing it is that there are a lot of unanswered questions about how California applies its law. Those questions are unanswered, because the case went to the Supreme Court at an early stage, without establishing the facts in a trial, and several justices suggested that perhaps the court should send the case back to establish an evidentiary record as to how the law is applied.\n\nWere the Supreme Court to strike down either of the law's provisions, it could well cast doubt on laws in \"pro-life states\" that require doctors to give extensive information about other options to patients seeking abortions.\n\nIn the California case, the Trump administration has a compromise position. It supports the requirement that unlicensed clinics disclose their status to patients, but it views as unconstitutional the provision that compels disclosure about the existence of free or low-cost abortions that the state of California provides.\n\nProtecting women from deception or trampling on the \"pro-life\" message?\n\n\"We're simply trying to make sure the recipient of health care information or advice understands exactly what he or she is entitled to in terms of services and that the information is accurate,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in defending the law.\n\nThat is not how the anti-abortion centers see it.\n\nThe law \"is requiring a licensed center... that is pro-life and wants to help women choose life, point the way to an abortion,\" said lawyer Kristen Waggoner, who represents the anti-abortion pregnancy centers that are challenging the California law. That, she adds, \"is not simply information.\"\n\nAs for unlicensed centers, she said, there is no need to disclose the lack of a medical license. \"They're not doing anything that requires a license,\" she said, \"so why would they need to say that?\"\n\nThere are plenty of good reasons, replies Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\n\"If these fake medical centers had on their front doors, 'We're pro-life centers. We're here to help you decide to continue your pregnancy,' there's nothing wrong with that, and that's fine,\" Northup said. \"But what they're trying to do instead is lure women in on false pretenses.\"\n\nIn recent years, the number of pregnancy centers that counsel against abortion has dramatically increased. Today there are about 2,700 of them around the country, more than three times the number of clinics that provide abortions.\n\nAnd just as some states provide taxpayer funds for abortions, 14 states directly fund anti-abortion pregnancy centers. From 2001 to 2006, the centers received an estimated $30 million in federal funding.\n\nThere is no data on how many of the 2,700 anti-abortion pregnancy centers are unlicensed. But unlicensed clinics offer pregnancy tests, limited ultrasounds, and, to an unskeptical eye, they can look very much like a licensed medical facility.\n\nThe personnel wear surgical scrubs or white coats and ask clients to fill out medical history questionnaires. Indeed, many clinics locate next to or across the street from a full service women's reproductive health center and some use similar sounding names.\n\nManipulating search engines\n\nDo these anti-abortion pregnancy centers deliberately locate close to abortion clinics? \"I sure hope so,\" said anti-abortion advocate Waggoner, \"because women should have both options. And they shouldn't see only a provider that has a financial incentive to get them to abort a child.\" Waggoner represents the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, NIFLA, an umbrella group of anti-abortion pregnancy centers.\n\nSome anti-abortion pregnancy center personnel are even more blunt.\n\nJacob Hall is director of services and client care at Care Net, an organization that supports crisis pregnancy centers. At a recent Care Net conference, he advised the centers on how to use search engines to identify key words for their marketing and websites, the object being to attract women searching online for an abortion clinic to an anti-abortion pregnancy center instead.\n\n\"I know 'abortion pill' is something people are searching,\" he said. \"'Abortion clinic,' 'abortion clinic near me,' 'abortion cost,'\" Hall said. \"Fantastic key words if those phrases are on your website. If they're not, easy, just add them. Just say, 'we're here to talk to you about abortion, including abortion pills and abortion surgery.'\"\n\nAt the same conference, Jana Pinson, director of a crisis pregnancy center in Texas, said she had great success with the term, \"planning parenthood.\" Though her clinic opposes abortion, she changed her website tag to 'The Number One Source of Abortion Information in the Coastal Bend,' \"because we are,\" she said.\n\nBrian Fisher, of Human Coalition, another group that helps anti-abortion clinics, has also advocated using these tactics to attract women seeking an abortion in hopes of derailing their plans. This sort of marketing is necessary, he argued last year, because \"the abortion-determined woman will not walk into a pregnancy center voluntarily.\"\n\nSeveral women NPR contacted were infuriated by these tactics.\n\nAnnie Filkowski went to a clinic because it advertised free pregnancy tests. She spent hours there before learning she was not pregnant, and when she then asked a counselor to write her a birth control prescription or give her advice on which method to use, she said the counselor told her, \"Birth control causes infertility and can give you cancer\" and other \"crazy\" things.\n\nDartricia Walker said she went to a clinic for a pregnancy that she very much wanted. She mistakenly thought it was a medically licensed facility, and that the person who conducted the ultrasound was a nurse. Neither was true. She then had a miscarriage that a doctor later told her might have been avoided had she received adequate medical care.\n\n\"I was really upset that I was given the wrong date,\" Walker said, \"because if I had known that I was due sooner, I would have gone sooner to an ob/gyn.\"\n\nThere are excellent clinics that oppose abortion, too. For an example of those, NIFLA, which is challenging the California law, referred us to \"Informed Choices,\" a licensed clinic in Gilroy, Calif., that has a staff of five, including two nurses, plus a volunteer ob/gyn who supervises medical procedures, and 20 other volunteers.\n\nChristine Vatuone, the executive director, said that while the clinic does oppose abortion, and will not refer patients to an abortion provider, all patients are clearly told that they have three options: abortion, adoption and parenting \u2014 and that every room in the center has a sign with five promises: \"that we will treat them with respect, that we will protect their privacy, that we will not pressure them, that we will support them, and that we will not lie to them.\"\n\nStill there is room for confusion about the clinic. Google \"pregnancy, Gilroy, CA,\" and the first three results are for Informed Choices, while the fourth is Planned Parenthood.\n\nGoogle \"Abortion, Gilroy, CA\" and Informed Choices comes up too.\n\nAnd \"on advice of counsel,\" the clinic does not display the mandatory language in the California law advising patients that the state provides free access to a full range of care from pre-natal to abortion.\n\nMany patients who seek out clinics that will support their pregnancy say they are thrilled with the counseling and material support clinics like Informed Choices provide, everything from food to baby clothes, diapers, car seats, and emotional support.\n\n\"It just gave me that push to let me know that, you know, I can do this,\" said Laura Wu after visiting a crisis pregnancy center in New York. \"It is possible for me to do this alone.\"", "keywords": ["centers", "clinics", "care", "clinic", "california", "pregnancy", "women", "skeptical", "challenged", "justices", "law", "calif", "appear", "abortion", "antiabortion"], "polarity": 0.10737555246989211, "subjectivity": 0.3965500013613221},

They said a man in his 30s was seriously injured. It's unclear if this is related to a series of other deadly blasts.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nIn Austin, Texas, tonight, there has been another report of an explosion. Police and paramedics are on the scene near a Goodwill store. It's unclear if this incident is related to four other explosions that have shaken this city this month. We're going to go now to Mose Buchele of member station KUT, who's following the situation. Hi, Mose.\n\nMOSE BUCHELE, BYLINE: Hey.\n\nCHANG: So what do we know about this latest incident?\n\nBUCHELE: Well, not much yet. Like you said, what we do know is that there was an explosion reported maybe about an hour ago in the southwest side of town near a Goodwill. Officials are saying that there was one injury reported - a man in his 30s who was transported to a hospital with injuries that don't appear to be life-threatening.\n\nCHANG: OK.\n\nBUCHELE: Of course it's not totally clear whether this is linked to all the other bomb attacks that have taken place in the city this month, but it comes as the city is in this kind of heightened state of alert. There have been four bombs that have exploded in Austin this month. Two people have died. Four others were injured. And just, you know, it seems like this is a fifth explosion here.\n\nCHANG: Today law enforcement appeared to catch at least some breaks in their investigation, right? Can you explain what happened earlier today?\n\nBUCHELE: Yeah, so just after midnight at a FedEx sorting facility about an hour outside of town, a package exploded on a conveyor belt, and police were later able to link that to the other explosions that we've had in Austin. And then at a different FedEx facility, this one closer to the city, they found another package that turned out to have a bomb inside of it that hadn't exploded. And so law enforcement have been able to learn that the same person sent both of these packages from a FedEx facility within Austin.\n\nCHANG: And do they know whether those two packages related to the other bombs that have detonated the past four weeks?\n\nBUCHELE: They appear - yes, they appear to all be related.\n\nCHANG: What have been the similarities in each of these cases?\n\nBUCHELE: That's really the strange this about this. And, I mean, this would cause anxiety in any circumstance. But this is especially tricky to wrap your head around because almost all of these have been different. The first three appear to be just left on people's doorsteps probably by the bomber. They weren't dropped - probably weren't dropped off by, you know, official deliverers, mail people. Then the fourth instance on Sunday - it was an explosion on the side of a road. It was essentially a booby trap with a bomb with a trip wire attached to it. Two young men hit the trip wire. The bomb exploded, and they were both hospitalized with injuries.\n\nThe fifth instance was this thing this morning at the FedEx facility outside of town. That exploded on the conveyor belt. So obviously now these bombs are being sent out through FedEx. Now this appears to be the sixth. Although, again - of course, again, that hasn't been officially confirmed. But it looks like it's happened at a business, at a Goodwill and - again, in the southwestern part of town.\n\nCHANG: So some of the bombs appear to be sort of targeted. Others have been more randomized in terms of...\n\nBUCHELE: They - yeah, and they - yes, yeah. And, I mean, of course there's a lot that's not known yet about what - where these things were sent through FedEx. But it almost seems like they've become more random.\n\nCHANG: Do we have any information in why these attacks are happening, and clue about motive?\n\nBUCHELE: Not really. I mean, there were a lot of ideas floated around initially, and it was - there was - there had been - some people still suspect that it was kind of hate-related, people targeted because of their race. But, you know, as we've said, now it seems like it's becoming more and more random and striking just different parts of town all over the city.\n\nCHANG: And in talking to people over the course of all these attacks, what kinds of things are you hearing from them? How are people carrying on right now?\n\nBUCHELE: I was walking around town today, interviewing people. And I have to say, people are pretty scared, you know? People are taking this very seriously. This is not a city that's used to this kind of thing, and people are taking it very, very seriously.\n\nCHANG: Mose Buchele is a reporter from member station KUT in Austin.

In a tearful presentation, Rocxanne Deschamps talked of her friendship with the late Lynda Cruz, the mother of accused gunman Nikolas Cruz, and the fear she felt most of the time that he was in her home.\n\nCruz is charged with the murders of 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month.\n\nDeschamps described making a death bed promise to Lynda Cruz to take in her two sons, Nikolas and Zachary, after she died. But once that happened, Nikolas Cruz's fascination with firearms became an issue for Deschamps and her two sons, Rock, 22 and Tyler, 5.\n\nShe knew about Cruz and his fascination with firearms. She'd seen what she described as \"army guns\" in the Cruz home which was next door to her own. She said Lynda Cruz told her Nikolas once held a rifle to her head. So Deschamps told Cruz when he moved in with her that he had to store his firearms someplace else.\n\nThe guns \"were taken to friend's house where I was assured by the friend's parents that they would be locked up,\" said Deschamps.\n\nNikolas Cruz lived with her for less than a month. \"At first he was on his best behavior,\" Deschamps said. But that didn't last. She called 911 on three separate occasions.\n\nShe said the first time it was after her mother found a receipt for a newly purchased rifle and ammunition in Cruz's room. He hadn't yet taken possession of the gun because of the waiting period. Deschamps wanted the police to prevent him from doing so.\n\nBut she recalled that the police \"said they couldn't stop him from buying or having possession of guns. I told them that Nikolas was 19 years old, but he felt mentally and emotionally similar [to] a twelve-year-old.\"\n\nThe second 911 call came when Cruz was discovered digging a hole in the backyard, apparently to bury a large gun box that was empty at the time. In the third call, she said, she reported Cruz punching walls and punching Deschamps' older son. Deschamps says she told the police she was afraid Cruz would return to her home with a gun.\n\nShe says when he returned, \"I told him I could not have guns and violence in my house and he had to find another place to stay. I could not live in fear in my own home.\"\n\nBut she said she would still help him and they stayed in touch.

The officers' body and car cameras had not been turned on.\"\n\nMinnesota law defines third degree murder as,\n\n\"Whoever, without intent to effect the death of any person, causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life, is guilty of murder in the third degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 25 years.\"\n\nFreeman explained his justification for charging Noor with third degree murder.\n\n\"A person sitting in a passenger seat of a squad car takes a gun, hears a noise, maybe sees some object...he reaches across in front of his partner, shoots a gun at an object that he can't see.

The company has been suspended from Facebook in the wake of a New York Times report revealing that it violated Facebook's terms of service for using personal data. And, in the wake of a series of undercover sting reports capturing CEO Alexander Nix making outlandish claims about the company bribing politicians or entrapping them by \"sending some girls to the candidate's house,\" Cambridge Analytica's board has suspended Nix from the company.\n\nIt's all a far cry from the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign, when Cambridge Analytica waded into American politics with the goal of giving conservatives big data tools to compete with Democrats. Its big promise: developing detailed psychological profiles of every American voter, so that campaigns could tailor their pitches from person to person.\n\n\"We've been appealing to the same demographic on the same issue,\" Nix told NPR in February 2016. \"yet how we nuance this engagement is completely different.\"\n\nNo, Cambridge Analytica couldn't fully capture the personality of every single voter. But here's how Nix pitched the company's approach at the time. Cambridge Analytica worked with researchers to develop \"a 120-question survey that seeks to probe personality,\" he said. \"And we've rolled this out to literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across America.\"\n\nThe company asked all sorts of questions about personality and behavior. Then it scored people on traits like openness, extroversion and agreeableness \u2014 aspects of the typical \"big five\" personality traits.\n\nPersonality profiles\n\nThose results were mixed together with polls, voter records and online activity in order to create personality models for voters. Cambridge Analytica may not have talked to you, Nix said, but \"if I talk to enough people who look like you, in terms of what data they have, I'd be able to quantify your personality based on the discussion I've had with other people.\"\n\nThis week, the Times reported that Cambridge Analytica collected a lot of this information by breaking Facebook's rules. An outside researcher affiliated with Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, developed an app for the company that required users to sign in using their Facebook accounts.\n\nFacebook's rules at the time allowed the app to suck up information about all those users, and even more importantly, information about their friends. That data included education, location, the groups and pages they liked, their relationship status, and where they worked.\n\nKogan, who created the app, was allowed to collect all this information for academic purposes. What he wasn't allowed to do was pass the data along to a third party, instead of using it for research, as had been promised.\n\nFacebook has now suspended Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform.\n\nCruz campaign embraces Cambridge Analytica\n\nAll this data went into the company's much-hyped psychological profiles. While Cambridge Analytica is now associated with Donald Trump's general election campaign, it was Texas Senator Ted Cruz who first employed the firm.\n\nThe Cruz campaign went all-in on political science theory and big data approaches to campaigning, and divided voters into six different psychological profiles during the early primaries. The campaign reached out to voters it grouped as \"timid traditionalists\" with different messaging than it did for \"temperamental\" voters, even if the calls, emails, and flyers were about the same Cruz stances on the same topics.\n\nThe psychological profiling got a lot of media attention after Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, especially after Nix publically claimed credit for the win in a series of media interviews.\n\nBut as the campaign advanced, the Cruz campaign became skeptical of the approach's. It ultimately phased out the psychological profiling attempts after the South Carolina primary, even though Cambridge Analytica staffers remained attached to Cruz's campaign.\n\n\"In explicit contractual language, Cambridge Analytica affirmatively represented that all data used by them were obtained legally, that they would conduct their operations 'in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,' and that they 'hold all necessary permits, licenses and consents to conduct its operations,'\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an emailed statement this week.\n\nCruz ended his campaign for president after the Indiana primary. With Cruz out of the race and Trump on his way to lead the Republican ticket, Cambridge Analytica began working for the GOP nominee. This shift paralleled the migration of the Mercer family, major Republican donors with a significant financial stake in the company.\n\nWhile Cruz's campaign had embraced data science and was willing to experiment with political science theories that had never before been tested on the presidential level, the Trump campaign's data operation had been nonexistent. Shortly after winning the Republican nomination, Trump told the AP he viewed data as \"overrated\" in politics.\n\nStill, Cambridge Analytica staffers embedded with Trump digital strategist Brad Parscale in his San Antonio office, and played a key role in the campaign's online efforts.\n\n\"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy,\" Nix unwittingly told Britain's Channel 4 in their undercover sting.\n\nBut, according to a source close to that operation, psychological profiling never entered into the picture. Given Trump's lack of digital infrastructure, the Cambridge Analytica staffers focused on much more basic goals, like increasing online fundraising, reaching out to undecided voters, and boosting Election Day turnout.\n\nPeople involved in both the Cruz and Trump campaigns say they never used the data Cambridge Analytica illicitly acquired from Facebook. And both campaigns ultimately soured on both the company and its CEO.\n\nNix repeatedly claimed credit for both Cruz and Trump's triumphs, violating long-held norms for behind-the-scenes campaign operatives.\n\nNix continues to brag about Cambridge Analytica's efforts. It's just that, in the most recent episode, he didn't realize he was doing-so on camera.", "keywords": ["trump", "election", "campaign", "psychological", "nix", "analytica", "personality", "cambridge", "2016", "data", "voters", "cruz"], "polarity": 0.09181622775372776, "subjectivity": 0.3731782106782108},

Once the bodies were exhumed, Indian authorities sent DNA samples from relatives of the missing workers. All but one have been identified.\n\nAmong the artifacts discovered at the site were ID cards, non-Iraqi shoes and religious bracelets.\n\nIn the days leading up to their disappearance, the AP reported many of the men made panicked phone calls to their relatives back in India, pleading for help to escape the ISIS-controlled region.\n\nAs a result, as NPR reported, anxious families began swamping government hotlines. \"A majority of the Indians kidnapped in Iraq hail from Punjab,\" Punjab's deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal told NPR. \"We are really worried ... The federal government must take every necessary action to bring [them] back home,\" he said at the time.\n\nBut The Telegraph reported, the Indian government never received any ransom demands or other direct communication from the kidnappers.\n\nSwaraj, has been roundly criticized by members of the opposing party \"for giving false hope to the nation.\" But she defended the decision to wait until this week to declare the men dead, insisting the government needed proof.\n\n\"It would have been a sin had we handed over anybody's body claiming it to be those of our people, just for the sake of closing files,\" she said.\n\nThe AP says dozens of mass graves like the one found outside of Badush have been discovered in territories previously held by ISIS. However, the Iraqi government says it doesn't possess the resources or trained personnel to examine all of them.\n\nThe Indian government said the identified bodies will be flown home after formalities are completed in Iraq.", "keywords": ["masih", "bodies", "mass", "isis", "workers", "grave", "kidnapped", "men", "indian", "reported", "iraq", "39", "told"], "polarity": -0.05050505050505051, "subjectivity": 0.27904040404040403},

This morning at a FedEx processing center about 60 miles from Austin, Texas, a package exploded. It's the fifth such bombing this month. Two people have been killed, and four others have been injured. The package that exploded along with a second package with a device that did not detonate were sent by the same person.\n\nSteve Adler is the mayor of Austin where most of the explosions have taken place, and he is with us now. Mr. Mayor, it's a pleasure to speak with you again. I'm sorry about why, but thank you for joining us.\n\nSTEVE ADLER: Absolutely.\n\nMARTIN: Do the investigators think the bombing this morning is connected to the first four in Austin?\n\nADLER: The first one appears to be linked, yes.\n\nMARTIN: The obvious question, though, is why? Do you have any sense of that? Why? What's the motive here?\n\nADLER: You know, we don't know a motive at this point. And, you know, the investigators are working really hard to try to identify the folks that are responsible. And there are literally hundreds - over 500 people here in Austin from federal agencies alone. All the resources that can be brought to bear are being brought to bear. But we don't know at this point. And quite frankly, they're trying not to telescope down, the theory being that if they do that, they might overlook questions that they should be asking or not seeing things that they should see.\n\nMARTIN: You know, after the first bombing, the police chief initially said that this wasn't terrorism, that this was an isolated incident. There was even the implication that the first victim himself might be at fault. Now, the chief has since apologized for any such implication, but I am wondering why the chief was so sure of that at the time and whether that assumption led to a delay in taking this as seriously as it obviously deserves.\n\nADLER: I think what the chief says is that he wasn't coming to those conclusions - an answer to a question not too dissimilar from the question that you asked. He commented that that was something that they were looking at. But he's looking at all things. And he later, you know, apologized for the way that he answered that question because he didn't stress enough that they were looking at all things at that point, not having precluded anything. And that's still where we are.\n\nMARTIN: Is it still - the suggestion has been made that this could possibly be a hate crime given the demographics of the people who were initially affected. Is that still something that is under consideration?\n\nADLER: You know, at this point, they're not ruling out anything and gathering as much information and data as they can. You know, the events that happened today add to the concern that people are feeling in the community. They add to the anxiousness, but they also give us more information and data and more evidence.\n\nMARTIN: And you mentioned the concern that people understandably are feeling about this. Could you just tell us a little bit more about what you're hearing from your constituents? What are they saying to you?\n\nADLER: Well, I think everybody here wants answers to questions. They want whoever's responsible identified, and they want this to be over. And what we're doing is we're focusing on the things that we can do. Law enforcement has asked us all to pull together, to get each other's backs, to be basically the eyes and ears for law enforcement, to identify suspicious things that people see if things appear like they're out of place.\n\nWe're telling people that if you see something that raises a question in your mind about whether you should report it or not, the very fact that you're having that debate means that the answer is yes. And you should pick up the phone and call 911. And that's what we're doing, and people can pull together to do that. And I think everybody is - it's good for everyone to hear that there are so many people that are involved, that this is the - you know, not only the state but the national priority at this point.\n\nMARTIN: All right. Steve Adler is the mayor of Austin, Texas. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nADLER: Yes, take care.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Schools, businesses and residents are putting new security measures in place.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nSome breaking news now - there has been a sixth explosion tonight in central Texas. Police and paramedics are on the scene at a Goodwill store near Austin. But police say this latest incident involved an incendiary device that was not a package bomb. They say they have no reason to believe this is related to prior bombings. Earlier today, a package destined for Austin exploded in a FedEx facility, and officials found another package mailed by the same person that contained an explosive device. But that device had not gone off. Reporter Ashley Lopez of member station KUT went out to gauge how people in Austin are reacting.\n\nASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: The folks who are most freaked out right now are people like Angel Torres. He lives just a few streets down from where one of the first package bombs exploded in southeast Austin.\n\nANGEL TORRES: I was really worried. Like, I messaged all of my friends that live in that area to make sure they're OK. I thank God, like, that they are OK and, like, none of them were hurt.\n\nLOPEZ: Torres says ever since then, he's changed some of his behavior, making sure he's paying more attention to what's going on around him.\n\nTORRES: I get out of class late at night. And I always, like, have my music going, like, blasting my headphones walking at night. So like, I'm definitely, like, going to, like, put the volume really low and, like, just have one earphone in and, like, always have, like, my phone on me.\n\nLOPEZ: A lot of folks in Austin are on edge mostly because police haven't said much about what exactly people should look out for. The first three explosions were packages left on people's doorsteps, but one this past Sunday was a bomb placed by a sidewalk and set off by a tripwire. Jackie Rylander says she's worried this can happen at any place, at any time.\n\nJACKIE RYLANDER: It seems like it can be anything now - backpacks. And it's not worth changing your whole life for. You've got to still live.\n\nLOPEZ: And this is a common sentiment, too. Folks like David Didonato say, yeah, this is scary, but so are other things.\n\nDAVID DIDONATO: How many people are killed by crossing the street? I mean, it's something to be worried about, but there's a lot of things to be worried about.\n\nLOPEZ: A lot of people in Austin are also surprised this is happening in the first place. Brittany Taylor says this is out of character for a city known for being quirky and friendly.\n\nBRITTANY TAYLOR: And it makes me sad honestly - like, more so sad and just kind of upset than freaked out that people would do this and take time out of their day just to hurt someone else. But it's just unfortunate. And then it kind of puts a stain on our city.\n\nLOPEZ: So far police say they don't know who or how many people are involved in these bombings.

He's not the only member of that legal team to do so.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump's legal team is growing by one. The move comes as Trump, more directly, goes after special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the president is simply expressing his frustration through tweets - even as the White House and Trump's outside lawyers say they are cooperating fully with the probe. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has this look at what Trump's legal team has been saying.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: The newest member of President Trump's outside legal team, Joe DiGenova, is a former federal prosecutor and well-known Washington lawyer. But it's more likely that his appearances on Fox News criticizing the Russia investigation are what landed him the gig. This was DiGenova on Fox in January.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\")\n\nJOE DIGENOVA: There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and - if she didn't win the election - to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely-created crime.\n\nKEITH: And here he was again on Fox just the day before Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former acting director of the FBI Andrew McCabe.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\")\n\nDIGENOVA: This system of equal justice has been rent asunder by the conduct of James Comey, America's best-known dirty cop, Andrew McCabe and others, including senior Obama administration Justice Department officials.\n\nKEITH: Another member of Trump's outside legal team, Jay Sekulow, hosts a national call-in show where he too weighs in on developments in the investigation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"JAY SEKULOW LIVE!\")\n\nJAY SEKULOW: This is Jay Sekulow. The Attorney General Jeff Sessions fires Andrew McCabe.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Live from Washington, D.C., Jay Sekulow Live!\n\nKEITH: On this edition of the show, Sekulow didn't offer much of his own analysis. But last month when Mueller's team secured the indictments of 13 Russians and three Russian entities for using social media and even organizing rallies to interfere in the U.S. election, Sekulow used his show to downplay the development.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"JAY SEKULOW LIVE!\")\n\nSEKULOW: Also, it was a program that started in 2014 - well before the election. So this was part of a - looks like an ongoing move by the Russians to engage this kind of issue is what it seems like to me. And then again, it predates the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\n\nKEITH: Another outside lawyer John Dowd said, over the weekend, he thinks the investigation should be shut down but also described ongoing discussions with the office of special counsel as productive and constructive. That's more in line with the approach taken by the lawyer inside the White House handling the Mueller investigation, Ty Cobb, who has emphasized cooperation and insists the president has no intention of firing Mueller. So what exactly is the strategy?\n\nSTEPHEN SALTZBURG: I think there's a little bit of good cop, bad cop going on here.\n\nKEITH: Stephen Saltzburg is a professor at George Washington University Law School. Cobb is the good cop, and the outside lawyers are doing more of the bad-cop routine, Saltzburg says.\n\nSALTZBURG: And I think Joe DiGenova's addition is part of the bad cop.\n\nKEITH: But Saltzburg, who was on the independent counsel team investigating Iran-Contra and has known Mueller for a long time, says this approach must be more about undermining the investigation in the court of public opinion than actually changing how Mueller conducts his probe.\n\nSALTZBURG: He's a very disciplined prosecutor. I don't think this is going to exacerbate his approach. In other words, it's not going to make him tougher on the president, but it's not going to soften him up either.\n\nKEITH: One other audience for all these tough public statements - their own client, President Trump.

On one side are self-identified crisis pregnancy centers that seek to prevent abortions. On the other side is the state of California, which enacted a law to ensure that the clinics do not mislead their patients. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The California Legislature found that hundreds of crisis pregnancy centers in the state used, quote, \"intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices that often confuse, misinform and even intimidate women from making fully informed, time-sensitive decisions about critical health care.\" In response, the state enacted a law that has two provisions. One requires all unlicensed clinics to inform patients in writing that the facility has no licensed medical personnel. That one-sentence disclosure is also required in advertisements.\n\nThe second provision requires a licensed clinic to post a sign saying that the state provides free and low-cost access to prenatal and delivery care and other reproductive care, including birth control and abortion. The sign is to list a county social services number for more information. On the steps of the Supreme Court today the law's author, Assemblyman David Chiu, called the measure a public health truth-in-advertising law.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDAVID CHIU: There are thousands of fake health clinics around our country, 370 in the state of California that are unfortunately deceiving women.\n\nTOTENBERG: But Michael Farris, who represents the anti-abortion clinics, said the statute unconstitutionally compels his clients to point women to places where abortion is available.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMICHAEL FARRIS: It's one thing for government to ban speech. That's not acceptable. But it's even worse for the government to put words in your mouth and turn you into their marionette that they can force you to say what they want you to say.\n\nTOTENBERG: Inside the high court, Farris got some pushback from the court's liberal justices. Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan all noted that the court in 1992 upheld provisions of a state law that required doctors to inform women seeking abortions of alternatives, including adoption, and to give these women nonmedical information - for instance, that the state requires the father of a child to pay child support. That's the exact flip side of this case, said Justice Kagan. Or as Justice Stephen Breyer put it, in law, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, a consistent opponent of abortion rights, asked if it would be constitutional for the state to require that all clinics, pro-life and pro-choice, post a full list of options available to pregnant women. Farris said that, too, would be unconstitutional. A few moments later, Farris said that unlicensed clinics should not be subject to any disclosure provision because they don't provide medical procedures.\n\nSotomayor disputed that. She pointed to a website for an unlicensed crisis pregnancy clinic, noting that there's a woman on the home page in a nurse's uniform in front of an ultrasound machine and that the text says that the clinic will, quote, \"educate women about different abortion methods available.\" How, asked Sotomayor, would this not be perceived as a medical facility? Farris eventually conceded that some unlicensed anti-abortion centers do provide pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, but maintained that these are not medical procedures.\n\nThe tone of the argument changed, however, when Justice Kennedy posed this hypothetical - what would happen if an unlicensed center had a billboard that said, choose life? Would they have to disclose that they're an unlicensed center? Yes, replied Farris, adding that the disclosure sentence would have to be in the same font size as choose life, and that it would also have to appear as well in other languages that are spoken frequently in that county.\n\nFor Kennedy, potentially the decisive vote in the case, that seemed to close the book. It's an undue burden, he said, and that should suffice to invalidate the statute. California Deputy Solicitor General Joshua Klein seemed unable to mitigate that concern, and soon liberal justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Ginsburg also expressed misgivings about the potentially onerous nature of the law's advertising provision.

The social media giant is facing more blowback from users, regulators and investors following reports that its user data was misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that worked for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.\n\nThat has spurred a user boycott, as angry former Facebook users started turning to Twitter over the weekend to express their discontent. David Chartier, a freelance writer in Chicago, was one of them:\n\n\"You can and arguably should #DeleteFacebook,\" Chartier wrote, in response to news that Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling firm, allegedly collected and used data from 50 million Facebook users without their permission.\n\nChartier's tweet \u2014 one of many like it \u2014 proved one of his most popular, eliciting 300 retweets and several responses. \"People who have been thinking about it, and they're getting inspired to now, or people who had done it recently\" reached out in support, he says.\n\nCalls for a consumer boycott of Facebook is just one of the company's mounting problems, all stemming from a rapid erosion of public trust. It failed to prevent the dissemination of fake news and misleading ads during the presidential election, and now it appears it failed to keep its users' data safe.\n\nTavis McGinn says he thinks the unauthorized use of data involves more companies than just Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"You have to assume that there are many, many other companies who are out there using the data in a similar way,\" he says.\n\nMcGinn now has his own research firm called Honest Data, but last year worked for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, conducting reputation research and polling for them. He left after only six months, because he did not like the company's culture, and says Facebook and its executives' reputations have gotten markedly worse since he left.\n\n\"A lot of the damage has already been done, and it is very hard to rebuild trust,\" he says.\n\nThe executives are coming under fire for their response. Facebook's data security chief, Alex Stamos, is leaving by August, amid reports of discord among executives over to handle its many problems.\n\nMotley Fool analyst Jason Moser says Facebook executives are hurting its stock price and making its brand problems far worse by not responding to the public outcry.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg made his resolution for 2018 to fix the Facebook platform,\" he says. \"Right now, that's getting off to ... a horrendous start.\"\n\nFacebook could not be reached for comment.\n\nMoser says the company is likely to face increased regulatory pressure. On Wednesday, Facebook officials are meeting with congressional staffers.

He says he informally surveys friends and acquaintances about their recent Facebook use. Every one of them reports having cut back. \"But then it also has to make you wonder, are Facebook's best days behind it?\"\n\nDavid Chartier, the Chicago writer, says he was inspired to quit Facebook after other friends quit. And now, he says, even more friends are following suit.\n\n\"We just took a little bit of time to talk a different way, maybe we message each other, or some of them use Twitter a little more often, maybe we're even calling each other,\" he says.", "keywords": ["users", "reports", "regulators", "moser", "friends", "latest", "companys", "facebook", "reputation", "scandal", "executives", "blow", "facebooks", "firm", "data"], "polarity": 0.07770146520146519, "subjectivity": 0.45641941391941393}
