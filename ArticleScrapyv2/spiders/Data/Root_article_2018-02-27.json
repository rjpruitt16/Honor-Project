The caller said a black woman he didn\u2019t know asked him for a ride, and when he let her in, a black man jumped in with her, pointed a gun at him, stole his 2003 Toyota RAV4 and put him out.\n\nAccording to the Kansas City Star and Pitch, police responded to the call and tracked the SUV using the man\u2019s cellphone locator, which he had left inside the car. When they spotted the vehicle, they inspected it and determined that no one was inside even though it was difficult to see inside because the RAV4 had tinted windows. Satisfied that the vehicle was unoccupied, they went back to their police cruiser to decide the next step. Another police officer arrived, and as the officers pointed toward the car, it began moving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three officers ran toward the car and screamed for the driver to get out. They banged on the door. The car kept moving, although they were not in danger of being hit. They said they heard gunshots being fired at them.\n\nSo they opened fire.\n\nOfficer Dakota Merrill emptied his 16-round clip. Officer Shane Mellot, standing beside the passenger door, squeezed off 12 shots. The other cop did not fire. When they opened the door, they found 37-year-old Philippe Lora slumped over the steering wheel. He was shot 20 times. A bullet was lodged in his spine. There was no woman in the car despite what had been reported by the suburban white male who made the original call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice investigators arrived on the scene. They taped off the area. Detectives searched the vehicle. Dakota Merrill\u2019s brother, who was off-duty and had nothing to do with the case, canvassed the scene. They let Merrill and Mellot get their story together. They brought in a dog to find the weapon that the officers said they heard fire a shot.\n\nThey never found a gun.\n\nThen the case just disappeared.\n\nThe officers were never disciplined. A police investigation cleared them of any wrongdoing, saying they \u201cfeared for their lives.\u201d A grand jury declined to indict the cops. Even stranger, Lora, the man who was shot 20 times, was never charged with a crime. He has never served a single day for supposedly shooting at police officers. He has never been charged with the carjacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, police gave the now-paralyzed Philippe Lora $4.8 million. They sealed the details of his case. They forbade him from ever talking about it again. For years, no one knew anything about it, not even Lora\u2019s family.\n\nThe Kansas City Police Department has done this before. It\u2019s what they are known for. When comparing the size of its force, the crime rate and how many people it kills, very few cities in the U.S. rank as high as Kansas City. None get away with it as often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1998 they killed 13-year-old Timothy Wilson after a car chase in which officers claimed the boy was driving toward them. He wasn\u2019t. The pickup truck was stuck in the mud. The police were never charged with wrongdoing, but a jury gave the child\u2019s mother $400,000.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 2016, cops killed Brandon Finch after saying that his car was lurching toward them. It wasn\u2019t. Dashcam footage showed the car moving slowly in reverse. They didn\u2019t interview the cops until three days after Finch was killed. A civil case is pending, but the officers were cleared of any wrongdoing\u2014even the one who fired nine times into a slowly moving car.\n\nThat officer\u2019s name is Dakota Merrill.\n\nKansas City cops are dangerous. They have killed 47 citizens in 11 years and nonfatally wounded another 56. According to a recent in-depth analysis of police data, the Kansas City Star found that the city ranks high on the list of police-shooting fatalities:\n\nWhen The Star recently compared Kansas City to 11 other cities, including larger ones like Denver and Milwaukee, it found that Kansas City had the third-most officer-involved fatal shootings per capita from 2005 through 2014. Only St. Louis and Cleveland recorded more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a city that is 30 percent black, 60 percent of the people killed by Kansas City police in the last 11 years were black. They were disproportionately killed by white officers.\n\nThe FBI and other law-enforcement agencies don\u2019t track how many people police officers shoot or kill each year, but when Portland, Ore., studied the issue in 15 major cities in 2012, they looked at the raw numbers. They didn\u2019t factor in shootings per capita. They didn\u2019t adjust for crime. They simply looked at how many people in each city police shot (fatally and nonfatally) over five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly the police in Washington, D.C., and Milwaukee shot more of their citizens than Kansas City police officers. But Kansas City still has those cities beat in one area: No single police department in America shoots and kills people as much as Kansas City and gets away with it as often.\n\nI know you\u2019re waiting to hear how many cops were indicted for murder or manslaughter. But first, you should know that we at The Root did these numbers ourselves. We took the data you have just read and figured out that Kansas City ranks No. 1 based on a complex mathematical equation. We figured this out because here is how many cops have been charged or indicted by a Kansas City prosecutor or grand jury for killing someone in the last 11 years:\n\nZero.\n\nYou read that right. See, the math was not so hard to do. The Star has collected data on every one of the city\u2019s police shootings since 2005, and even in cases like Wilson\u2019s and Lora\u2019s, officers walk away scot-free. Notice that last statement was not qualified with \u201cusually.\u201d They always get away with it. Every single time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Star found that since 2005, prosecutors or grand juries haven\u2019t charged a single Kansas City police officer with a crime. In fact, in the 45 years of the city\u2019s Office of Community Complaints, which handles complaints against law-enforcement personnel, the office has never investigated an officer-involved shooting.\n\nEver.\n\nBecause prosecutors work hand in hand with law enforcement every day, most people would question the ethics of allowing people who are essentially the prosecutors\u2019 co-workers to investigate the crimes of the officers. Nowhere is this conflict of interest more evident than in Kansas City. It strains credulity to believe that a group who has shot 103 people since 2005 is blameless in every single incident. It not only seems unlikely\u2014nationwide numbers show it is a statistical impossibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, trials are rare. Convictions almost never happen. But Kansas City would have us believe that they have a spotless record when it comes to police shootings. Apparently, there is no other professional entity in the entire world that is as mistake-free as the Kansas City Police Department. They are perfect. They shoot more civilians. They kill more civilians. Yet somehow, they never make an error. They soar high above every other worker in every other industry in the universe.\n\nI\u2019ll believe that when pigs fly.", "keywords": ["killing", "americas", "officers", "killed", "shooting", "shot", "star", "deadliest", "cops", "charged", "away", "forces", "car", "black", "gets", "single", "kansas", "city"], "polarity": 0.06706761110375567, "subjectivity": 0.4096150168439326},

Jones to be released after students and faculty at the University of Kansas Law School, in conjunction with the Midwest Innocence Project, presented evidence showing he was wrongly identified in a photo lineup, according to KCUR.\n\nJones had spent nearly 16 years in prison for a crime of which he was innocent. Hours after walking free Thursday, Jones said he was still pinching himself.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe whole time my lawyer was telling me [the judge] is about to reverse my sentence and release me, I didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen he finally said it, I shed some tears. It was a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1999, Jones was picked out of a lineup three months after an attempted purse snatching at a Walmart parking lot in Roeland Park, an overwhelmingly white Kansas community.

And although he had an alibi, he was found guilty of aggravated robbery and sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison.

Seattle Seahawks players locked arms during the playing of the national anthem; Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters raised a black-gloved fist; and some Miami Dolphins players knelt during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" and placed their hands over their hearts, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe protest follows the recent actions of San Francisco backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sat while the national anthem played during a preseason game as a protest against the over-policing of minority communities.\n\nThe four Miami players\u2014Arian Foster, Michael Thomas, Jelani Jenkins and Kenny Stills\u2014stood during President Barack Obama's 9/11 message regarding the 15th anniversary of the tragedy. All four knelt during the anthem and stood at the conclusion of the song.\n\n\"If it's about the knee that people are upset about, every Sunday people of faith take a knee to give thanks to their lord and savior, whatever faith or religion that they are,\" Foster said, according to AP. \"It's not about a knee, it's not about the [symbolism], it's about the message. They say it's not the time to do this, but when is the time?\"\n\nJenkins noted that for him, the protest was an opportunity to raise awareness.\n\n\"I chose to get involved to see if I could create change, raise awareness. And I want to make it clear that there is no disrespect to the military or to police officers\u2014I'm not about that. I love everyone,\" Jenkins said after the game, according to AP. \"I would like to keep moving forward in the right direction with everybody: equal rights, equal opportunity. From my position, it doesn't seem that it's happening. That's why I took a stand.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDolphins team owner Stephen Ross spoke in support of his protesting players: \"I don't think it was any lack of respect. I think everybody here, our team and our whole organization, respects the flag and what it stands for, the soldiers and everything. These guys are really making a conversation of something that's a very important topic in this country, and I'm 100 percent supportive of them.\"\n\nFor several weeks, players from the Seattle Seahawks were debating about how they should protest. According to AP, all of the players and head coach Pete Carroll were engaged in the discussion. They eve enlisted Harry Edwards, an African-American sociologist, to help guide the discussion. The team decided to lock arms during the anthem but added that the commitment to change didn't stop there.\n\n\"Gestures mean nothing without follow-through. That's what Harry Edwards said, and that's what I agree with,\" Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman said, according to AP. \"People get confused that you have to go out there and put on a show and make this gesture and make people aware of it, and we're more about action.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWide receiver Doug Baldwin said that players plan on meeting with the mayor of Seattle and local law enforcement.\n\n\"We know that there has to be change and progress,\" Baldwin said, AP reports. \"Change is inevitable. Change will always happen. But you got to apply direction to change, and that's when it's progress.

Just when you think that the allegations coming from one of the most revered and respected adobes worldwide can\u2019t get any worse, the entire White House\u2014staff, administration, housekeeping\u2014is like, \u201cHold my folders.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the White House was rocked by allegations that Staff Secretary Rob Porter abused two of his ex-wives. The rumors were supported by photos showing one of Porter\u2019s ex-wives with a black eye. Now several sources are reporting that the White House was fully aware of claims that Porter was a serial abuser and not only hired him but also allowed him to continue an untrammeled rise within the administration\u2014including dating Trump\u2019s fake daughter, Hope Hicks, to whom the president affectionately creepily refers as \u201cHopie\u201d and \u201cHopester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, the president knew for months that Porter had been accused of domestic abuse, and even after Tuesday\u2019s bombshell report by the Daily Mail, which included claims that Porter was both verbally and physically abusive to his ex-wives, the White House was still scrambling to keep him on staff.\n\nPorter denied the allegations but resigned Wednesday. The White House, however, announced shortly after his resignation that Porter wouldn\u2019t be leaving the White House immediately, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,\u201d Porter said in a statement provided by the White House, Axios reports. \u201cMy commitment to public service speaks for itself. I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question, why is the White House working so hard to keep Porter on staff? Well, I can\u2019t make this any plainer: Porter is dating Hopie! Hopie is not only the president\u2019s fake daughter (totally normal for this president to have a fake daughter; seriously, there is nothing to see here) but is also considered a member of the untouchable staff, which includes the president\u2019s actual family. CNN notes that before Porter resigned, Hopie, who serves as the White House communications director, helped draft a supportive statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him,\u201d the statement from Kelly reads, CNN reports.\n\nKelly now notes that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the allegations against Porter but stands by his initial statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, get this, CNN notes that the claims against Porter were found during a routine background check by the FBI a year ago. So Porter worked at the White House for a year, worked very closely with the president and his chief of staff, but didn\u2019t have security clearance? Where they do that at?\n\nClearly, President \u201cGrab \u2019em by the Pussy\u201d is no feminist. Hell, he told the repugnantly smug Piers Morgan as much during a recent interview. He\u2019s never been a champion of women\u2019s rights, yet 53 percent of white women voted against their self-interests to put him in office.\n\nThis president is trash, and clearly everyone around him is such. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that the president is flying by the seat of his pants and wearing his KFC bucket on his head because he has no clue what he\u2019s doing in the White House and doesn\u2019t care whom he offends. Porter shouldn\u2019t have needed to resign because he never should have been hired! But they knew that and did it anyway because, well ...

Hicks and Trump had a very close relationship that Trump\u2019s inner circle came to view in familial terms. \u201c[Hope] Hicks was in fact thought of as Trump\u2019s real daughter, while Ivanka was thought of as his real wife,\u201d the book states.

According to Vogue (I\u2019m seriously going to vomit all over my computer), Trump has \u201ccutesy\u201d nicknames for Hicks, including \u201cHopester\u201d and \u201cHopie.\u201d I don\u2019t know how Ivanka feels about this, but \u201cHopie\u201d is also considered to be a Trump whisperer who \u201cknows not to disturb him when he\u2019s watching golf,\u201d and a right-hand woman who \u201ctotally understands\u201d him, Vogue notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis relationship sounds completely creepy, and as such, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be losing this job anytime soon. She is now considered around the White House to be one of \u201cthe untouchables,\u201d Vogue notes, a group that also includes Trump daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Hicks has also been earning the maximum salary since she came on board.

So for this week\u2019s show (audio), we teamed up with two Chicago-based newsrooms \u2014 the Data Reporting Lab and the Chicago Reporter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what they found:\n\n\u201cThe real story behind Chicago\u2019s gun death stats\n\n\u201cSignificantly fewer people are dying because of gun violence in Chicago. However, it turns out that more people are actually being shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGun homicides dropped by 30 percent in the last two decades, and law enforcement officials take credit for the drop.\n\n\u201cAnalysis from the Data Reporting Lab throws cold water on that theory: Shootings in the city actually increased by 15 percent during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe reporters found a different cause for the decline in deaths: improvements in trauma care at hospitals, thanks to innovations pulled from the battlefields of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConfronted with this new information, officials say closely studying injuries, not deaths, could change how local governments try to solve gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead more: The Bleeding of Chicago\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened after Chicago\u2019s great school closure\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s historic school closures were supposed to help kids in bad schools, but researchers determined that most kids didn\u2019t see improvements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2013, Chicago\u2019s school board voted to close 50 schools \u2013 an unusually large number.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Mayor Rahm Emanuel claimed the closures were to ensure that kids in bad schools made their way to better ones.\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s public schools have lost more than 52,000 students in the past 10 years. That\u2019s because school closures sometimes prompt parents to leave the city altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd black neighborhoods have suffered some of the most severe declines and most of the school closures and budget cuts. A loss of 11,000 students in 2016 \u2018tracked closely with population decline in communities with high crime or poverty,\u2019 according to a report from WBEZ.\u201d\n\n\n\n700 Honor Editor, Historian Lerone Bennett Jr.\n\nImage: Journal-isms\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It Was Always About Our Struggle,\u2019 a Friend Says\n\nBy Cheryl V. Jackson\n\nLerone Bennett Jr.\u2019s \u201cWhat Manner of Man: A Biography of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d was the first book on King that Michael Eric Dyson ever read, the author, minister and Georgetown University sociology professor said Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat book was like a Bible to me. I can still see the cover. I can still smell that book.\n\n\u201cI read that book and it changed my life.\u201d\n\nDyson was giving the eulogy at Bennett\u2019s funeral, for which about 700 people packed St. Columbanus Catholic Church on Chicago\u2019s South Side to pay tribute to the former Ebony and Jet magazine editor who authored some of the most consumed books on black history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[My] original inspiration was Lerone Bennett Jr. because he took his tasks seriously,\u201d Dyson continued. \u201cIf you read that book today, it is insightful, it is rhetorical, it is sophisticated in every sense of the word \u2014 like Mr. Bennett himself.\u201d\n\nBennett died of advanced vascular dementia at his Chicago home Feb. 14. He was 89.\n\n\u201cEverything about the service was befitting Lerone and the essence of Lerone,\u201d said Lynn Norment, a former Ebony managing editor. It reflected the people and things that Bennett held dear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey included jazz: Saxophonist Audley Reid played Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cTake the A Train\u201d to lead the recessional.\n\nThey included the advancement of black people, of which he eagerly spoke about, even in his down time.\n\nActress Val Gray Ward, a longtime friend, spoke of the Fourth of July holidays their families would spend together, \u201cplaying jazz or bid whist and just talking about our struggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was always about our struggle.\u201d\n\nAnd they included his alma mater, Morehouse College.\n\n\u201cHe said many times the smartest, stupidest thing he ever said was that if he didn\u2019t attend Morehouse College, he didn\u2019t want to attend any college,\u201d said his oldest granddaughter, Nekesa Josey, herself an author.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorehouse President David A. Thomas, who took office Jan. 1, said, \u201cLerone Bennett Jr. is the model for Morehouse men. I look out at the 2,000 students and see somewhere among them is a Lerone Bennett. I have to go forth as if each one of these 2,000 young men is my Lerone Bennett.\u201d About 40 alumni sang the school hymn. At the visitation Friday night, about 30 members of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity sang the Kappa song.\n\nThose dearly held institutions also included Johnson Publishing Co., where Bennett wrote about key events in the civil rights movement, and where he published works that have been on coffee tables and library shelves for decades. Among them is a 1964 biography of King, his Morehouse classmate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett worked for Ebony magazine from 1954 until his retirement in 2003.\n\n\u201cLerone was the historian that Dr. King trusted the most because he knew him best,\u201d the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. said from the pulpit.\n\nOthers in attendance included the Rev. George Clements; Walter E. Massey, former National Science Foundation director and Morehouse president; Julieanna Richardson, founder of the HistoryMakers; Haki Madhubuti, poet and founder of Third World Press; Norment, who spoke; Ken Smikle, president of Target Market News; Renee Ferguson, former Chicago television journalist; and Linda Johnson Rice, daughter of Johnson Publishing Co. founder John H. Johnson and CEO of Ebony Media Operations. Johnson Publishing sold Ebony and Jet magazines to a private equity firm in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoy Bennett, Lerone Bennett\u2019s daughter, told Journal-isms she had invited Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, \u201cwho was very comforting.\u201d Farrakhan could not attend because it is the Nation\u2019s Saviour\u2019s Day weekend, she said, but he sent a representative to read a tribute.\n\nBennett\u2019s \u201cBefore the Mayflower: A History of Back America,\u201d first published in 1962, told of the first blacks arriving in the colonies on a ship that reached Jamestown, Va., in 1619, the year before the Mayflower did.\n\nIn the controversial \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream,\u201d Bennett said Lincoln was not an abolitionist but \u201ca conservative politician who said repeatedly that he believed in white supremacy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of Lerone Bennett Jr.\u2019s gifts to us all is that he was indeed a scholar, a historian, a teacher of history that forced America to look at herself; at her whole self,\u201d said Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago. \u201cHe made history shaping, forming, educating and shining a light on hidden truths.\n\n\u201cI thank you for your boldness and your willingness to teach America lessons she still doesn\u2019t want to learn.\u201d\n\nImage: Cheryl V. Jackson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew addressed Bennett as \u201cLerone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThose of us who have known and worked with him; we had so much respect for him that there was no other way to refer to him. He was Mr. Bennett,\u201d said Walter Leavy, former Ebony managing editor.\n\nYet he was anything but standoffish.\n\n\u201cHe was a totally unpretentious man unaffected by his stature,\u201d Leavy said. \u201cThrough it all, he was one of the most approachable people you could ever imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe watched him. We listened to him. We followed directions. And each one of us became better \u2014 better writers, better editors, better artists, better photographers, better administrative assistants. Overall, we just became better. That was the effect he had on us,\u201d Leavy continued.\n\n\u201cIn the sports world, you hear them talking about certain players having an aura about them that brings out the best in their teams. Well, in that sense, Mr. Bennett was our Michael Jordan.\u201d\n\nHonoring a \u201cRace Man\u2019s\u201d Values: More than 2,000 at John H.

SPJ and its members are fortunate to have Alison as our executive director, and I look forward to working with her.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBethel McKenzie succeeds Joe Skeel, who took the executive director position with the Indiana State Bar Association in December.\n\n\u201cA native of Miami, Bethel McKenzie served for five years as executive director of the International Press Institute, the world\u2019s oldest global press freedom organization, in Vienna. She was the first American, first woman and first African American to hold the position since it was founded in 1950. In addition, she has worked as a visiting professor of print and investigative journalism at the Indian Institute of Journalism and New Media in Bangalore, India. . . .\n\n\u201c \u2018I am beyond excited to join an organization that I have held in high esteem since I first learned of it as a high school rookie reporter at The Miami Herald,\u2019 she said. \u2018The work that SPJ has done in supporting both student and professional journalists, as well as its diligent fight for press freedom in the United States and abroad, is crucial \u2014 now more than ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBethel McKenzie was a Knight International Journalism Fellow in Ghana in 2008-09, managing director of the Nassau Guardian in the Bahamas in 2007 and executive editor of the Legal Times in Washington, D.C., in 2006-07. She has also worked at The Los Angeles Times and The Miami Herald. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Commondreams.org\n\nIn Debate Over Arming Teachers, What About Race?\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the school shooting that killed 17, President Trump and the National Rifle Association\u2019s main proposal to prevent another tragedy like the one in Parkland, Fla., has been to arm teachers . . .,\u201d Eugene Scott wrote Friday for the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut that desire has led some Americans, especially those who discuss race and politics, to raise questions: Will we be arming all teachers, including black teachers or education professionals who teach in mostly minority districts? It\u2019s a worthwhile question, given the police killings of unarmed black men in recent years.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be. There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a school of mostly white students in a fairly affluent suburb. But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.\n\n\u201c \u2018Another tragic moment. But there are folks in communities that I know who have been burying their kids for a long time because guns have been in their communities. Parents have been grieving because they\u2019ve been putting their babies in [the] ground,\u2019 Eddie S. Glaude, a Princeton University religion and African American studies professor, told MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGlaude added that it took \u2018certain kinds of people to die for us to get this question on the table.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to arming teachers and the factor race might play, two issues are being raised: (1) Arming teachers of black students who may have a racial bias, and (2) arming black teachers and education workers, who face their own risks carrying a weapon. . . .\u2019 \u201c\n\nJonathan Capehart, Washington Post: An open letter to Alfonso Calderon and the kids of Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: The real test for Parkland\u2019s young activists is when the media attention goes away\n\nJulia Manchester, the Hill: Media organizations sue for security footage from outside Florida high school\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr., Washington Post Writers Group: America needs to talk about a lot more than just guns\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobyn Pennacchia, Quartz: What America is getting wrong about three important words in the Second Amendment\n\nThe South Korean boy band BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys and Bulletproof Boy Scouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the United States for a group that mostly does not sing in English.

And all five elected not to use a black photographer to handle the representation of the all-black starring cast of Black Panther.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, five white men, one white woman and one Asian woman were tasked with creating the pictures, which have immediately gone viral, especially on Black Twitter. (Kwaku Alston did shoot a Black Panther cover for Entertainment Weekly last fall.) . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Essence\n\nLewis also wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, this is far from the first time that magazines have missed an opportunity to make a statement with who they hire to shoot their covers. . . . When you look at three of the largest magazines that write about and reflect African-American culture \u2014 Essence, Ebony and GQ \u2014 you see the lack of African-American photographers is nothing new.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2017, [among] the three magazines, just 4.25 covers were made by a black photographer, and three of them were done by the same person. (The .25 comes about because a photographer shot one photo in a series for a cover image.)\u201c\n\nBrooke Pawling Stennett, digital managing editor of the Columbia Chronicle at Columbia College Chicago, cited Lewis\u2019 piece Sunday in making a similar point about covering a popular Korean boy band.\n\n\u201cIn the last year, South Korean boyband BTS, also known as Bulletproof Boyscouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the U.S. for a group that does not sing in English \u2014 except for a few lyrics. 2017 was huge for BTS: It became the first ever K-Pop group to win a Billboard award, hit top 10 on the American iTunes charts, performed at the American Music Awards and rung in 2018 on Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the success came with a major drawback. The only member of the group who speaks semi-fluent English is the \u2018leader,\u2019 RM, though other members memorize certain phrases for interviews. During the group\u2019s press tours in March and November 2017, the other six members were forced to sit in nearly complete silence until RM got a second to breathe and translate the questions.\n\nPhoto: Journal-isms\n\n\u201cAnd most of the time, there was no time to translate, thus alienating the members and resulting in mass video compilations of painfully awkward silences. Not only did the members not understand a majority of what was being said, but the journalists also floundered when the members did their best to communicate and were met with blank looks or a quick diversion. Sure, this is funny in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t until BTS was the face of Billboard Magazine\u2019s February issue that it became apparent how unfunny it was. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cE. Alex Jung, a freelance journalist was sent to Seoul, South Korea, to interview BTS for the cover. . . .\n\n\u201cThough Jung points out in his Feb. 15 article that his Korean is \u2018like a 10-year-old\u2019s,\u2019 in the words of RM, at least Billboard had the decency to send someone who can interview a Korean group in the language its members are comfortable, no matter if he got help or not.\n\n\u201cJung took to Twitter shortly after the release of the interview, stating in a Feb. 15 tweet: \u2018[A]lso, props to Billboard for hiring someone (yes, in this case me) who can speak Korean to interview a Korean group. I\u2019ve seen way too many publications send non-Korean speaking reporters to cover K-Pop and it truly blows my mind how that\u2019s acceptable journalistic practice.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephanie Mehta Named Editor of Fast Company\n\nPhoto: Folio\n\n\u201cMansueto Ventures has tapped Vanity Fair deputy editor Stephanie Mehta as the next editor-in-chief of Fast Company,\u201d Greg Dool reported Monday for Folio:, quoting CEO Eric Schurenberg.

Strahler reported Monday for Crain\u2019s Chicago Business. He was 67.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrahler wrote, \u201cMitchell\u2019s City Hall experience, according to friend and attorney Stephen Allison, provided a \u2018fantastic perspective of crisis management\u2019 that informed relationships with African-American leaders (paywall) like the late attorney Earl Neal and the late Chicago Public Schools President Michael Scott, and with clients that included Exelon and the city of Chicago. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBeginning his career as a journalist, Mitchell covered politics for the Sun-Times in 1970 after winning an internship as a precocious Morehouse College student, according to the . . . HistoryMakers. The Mobile, Ala., native received an economics degree the following year from the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\n\u201cMitchell worked for the Washington Post from 1972 to 1973 and as Jet and Ebony magazines\u2019 Washington editor until 1974. After a stint as Washington columnist for Black Enterprise magazine, he became director of corporate communications in 1980 for Johnson Products in Chicago. . . .\u201d Mitchell was also a consultant to Carol Moseley Braun\u2019s successful and historic U.S. Senate campaign in 1992.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiversity Means Native People Telling Own Stories\n\n\u201cReporting on, featuring, and otherwise highlighting issues within the American indigenous community is something that I will continue to do, in part because . . . covering the Mountain West means covering Native issues,\u201d Anne Helen Petersen, senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News, wrote Sunday for tinyletter.com.\n\n\u201cBut I also hope that every story on Native issues will be my last. Not because I don\u2019t want to keep covering it, but because I\u2019d so love to see us hire an indigenous writer who can decide what stories need telling, and how best to tell them. (To be clear, I don\u2019t think that indigenous people should only report on indigenous matters; one of the beauties of the BuzzFeed culture section is that we\u2019re able to write in a way that matches our broad interests.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince white people first arrived in the Americas, they have been the primary authors of the Native experience for other white people, using rhetoric that transformed annihilation, exploitation, and degradation into, well, the story of Thanksgiving, and Pocahontas, and countless other bloodless, white savior narratives. No matter how sensitive I try to be, no matter how much I shut up, I am still a part of that long and unforgivably destructive history. It\u2019s not my personal fault, per se, but it is my fault if I can\u2019t understand that legacy and my place in it.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about diversity or discrimination in this country, Natives are generally made invisible. . . .\n\n\u201cNatives are also generally excluded from conversations about diversity in newsrooms. Maybe it\u2019s that most national newsrooms are located in places without prominent Native populations; maybe it\u2019s that most editors, like most people, have never lived in a place where Native issues were framed (by the white press) as prominent. But the logic that encourages hiring more Muslim reporters, more trans reporters, more black reporters, more non-binary reporters, more non-coastal reporters, more conservative reporters, should naturally extend to indigenous reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf, after Trump\u2019s election, we actually want to take issues of class and rural-ness more seriously, it makes sense to hire someone familiar with some of the most working class and rural parts of the nation: reservations. (It also makes sense to hire a Native person who didn\u2019t grow up on a reservation \u2014 as Tommy Orange\u2019s book explains, if there\u2019s anything more invisible than the reservation Native, it\u2019s the Urban Native). . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Susan Cox\n\nL.A.

Put sugar in our grits (although, honestly, we would never consider such a terrorist act. I only put it here because I prefer multiples of three and to grits-shame The Root\u2019s deputy managing editor, Yesha Callahan). Read my mother\u2019s Ebony before she did.\n\nI have no idea why. My mom demanded that her Ebony magazines be treated like a sneakerhead\u2019s pair of vintage Jordans\u2014she didn\u2019t want them creased. I only point out that fact to explain the reverence for the magazine in my childhood home. My affinity for Ebony is also the reason I called my mother the first time the magazine asked me if I would be a regular contributor. Even now, even though the company essentially stole my work, I am unreasonably reluctant to go hard on Ebony.\n\nWhen Jagger Blaec became one of the first writers to speak publicly about the issue, other freelancers for the magazine realized that they weren\u2019t the only ones who had work stolen. Soon the hashtag #EbonyOwes began trending, and black writers came out of the woodwork to share stories about how they had been stiffed by the iconic magazine, myself included.\n\n\n\nAfter the National Writers Union picked up the cause and filed suit against Ebony Media Operations in September 2017, the magazine agreed to pay a list of more than 40 writers, almost all of them black, a total of $74,768. The settlements would be paid in quarterly disbursements, with the writers who had been waiting the longest receiving the earliest payments. By Dec. 28, 2018, all 44 people owed money by Ebony will be paid, per the settlement agreement.\n\nFor the sake of transparency, let me state that I was not part of the group who filed suit against the company for the money it has owed me for articles I wrote for the website dating back to August 2016. Although I want my money, I\u2019d rather hold on to the anger so I can drag them if I see them in the streets. I haven\u2019t yet figured out how I would drag a media brand or an inanimate object, but trust me ... I\u2019ll figure it out. I\u2019m pretty clever when it comes to dragging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I didn\u2019t send the writers union my information in time.\n\nIf Ebony were a white publication, I\u2019d say they treated black writers like slaves. If they weren\u2019t such a large part of my upbringing, I\u2019d call them thieves who exploited the one resource that made their company worth anything.\n\nDuring a time when televisions only had three channels and one didn\u2019t work unless you made your little sister stand beside the TV and gently touch the antenna under threat of have snot rubbed on her neck when she went to sleep, Ebony was entertainment and information. In my head, I still can\u2019t bring myself to say \u201cFuck those guys,\u201d because it feels like I\u2019m saying \u201cFuck us\u201d or \u201cFuck my people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I realize that Ebony is just a collection of letters. It\u2019s an idea. They stole from black people and never had any intention of paying up until they were faced with the prospect of facing the legal ramifications. The white man is what made them pay black writers. They are as much vultures of black culture as the Kardashians or Rachel Dolezal.\n\nEbony no more deserves my respect than Donald Trump. Working out of the same building and having the same title doesn\u2019t make Trump George Washington or Barack Obama. Ebony is dead. The name is still alive, but the thing I once knew has been inhabited by thieves and would-be plantation owners.\n\nNow #EbonyOwes no one but me.\n\nSo, yeah ... fuck those guys.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: When The Root contacted Ebony Media Operations for comment on the settlement agreement, the company noted that it does \u201cnot comment or issue statements on matters that have been settled legally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not mention Michael Harriot\u2019s check.", "keywords": ["magazine", "money", "ebonyowes", "settlement", "unpaid", "ebony", "work", "writers", "media", "fuck", "settles", "black", "finale", "company", "series"], "polarity": 0.037224426807760176, "subjectivity": 0.44192273775607116},

Donald Trump\u2019s Tumultuous First Year in Office\n\nDonald Trump made it his business to dominate the news cycle as much as possible in 2017, and there is no sign of a change in strategy for 2018.\n\nHis comments on race and religion led journalists of color to confront his press representatives at briefings and to question whether to flat-out call the president a white supremacist. In one of many outrageous examples, from May, then-Press Secretary Sean Spicer demonized Hispanic immigrant teens accused of rape, using the accusation as justification for the president\u2019s campaign against immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turned out that the charges against the teens were dropped. The defense maintained all along that the sex was consensual. The White House was questioned sharply and justifiably about its rush to judgment. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta was often front and center.\n\nThere was the feud between April Ryan, Washington correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, and Omarosa Manigault Newman, who, after rumors that her time was limited, was ousted in December as a White House adviser, effective in 2018. Omarosa\u2019s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in August proved to be a \u201chot mess\u201d as she clashed with panel moderator Ed Gordon.\n\nRyan was not invited to the White House Christmas Party for the first time in 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was overlooked,\u201d Ryan told the Washington Post. \u201cI think they don\u2019t like me. For whatever reason, they have disdain for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome news organizations, among them the Post and the New York Times, produced a dizzying series of scoops in May about Trump and his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. But black and brown reporters were not on the teams unearthing them.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, attributed the low representation to an industry-wide problem.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough investigative reporters who happen to be African American or Latino,\u201d Baquet said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s demonization of the news media \u2014 calling members \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2014 had worldwide consequences. His insistence on dominating news cycles was not only crowding out other news, but emboldening autocrats elsewhere. The Trump administration was delivering a message, said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, that \u201cJournalists are contemptible, and governments that crack down on the media face no consequences in terms of their relationship with the US. . . .\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appeals to white nationalists gave a boost to best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates of the Atlantic, whose public profile rose higher with publication of \u201cThe First White President,\u201d an article excerpted from his book about the Obama era, \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power.\u201d\n\nNews media efforts to report more on Trump supporters met with pushback from some journalists of color, who argued that news involving voters of color was being sacrificed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time looking at angry white voters,\u201d Nikole Hannah-Jones, a writer for the New York Times Magazine who specializes in racial issues, said at the Online News Association convention in October. \u201cThis is the first election after the [weakening of the] Voting Rights Act and voter suppression. Lots of votes were probably suppressed.\u201d\n\nA study from the battleground state of Wisconsin \u201cestimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law,\u201d Patrick Marley and Jason Stein reported Sept. 26 for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African Americans and low-income people.\n\nIn the aftermath of Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama\u2019s special December election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, African American voters \u2014 especially African American women \u2014 were credited with saving the day for Jones. Many were surprised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheila Tyson, a member of the Birmingham City Council who is Alabama convener of the nonpartisan National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, told Journal-isms, \u201cno one covered us and what we were doing.\u201d\n\n2. Sexual Harassment Charges Bring Down Powerful\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2014 women and men who came forward with accusations of sexual harassment \u2014 were Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d and it was appropriate that Tarana Burke, a black woman, was among them. A social activist, Burke first used the hashtag #MeToo more than a decade ago as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault.\n\n\n\nAs with the Trump investigations, black and brown journalists were not prominent among the reporters uncovering misdeeds, but were among the accusers and the accused.\n\nThe accused included talk-show host Tavis Smiley; Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press; BuzzFeed White House correspondent Adrian Carrasquillo; longtime Fox Business anchor Charles Payne; and Francisco Cort\u00e9s, vice president of Fox News for the English-language Fox News Latino website, now stripped of original content. In the Cort\u00e9s case, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement with Fox worth more than $2.5 million in late February, Emily Steel reported for the New York Times in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of these men denied the charges or said they were overblown. A rape charge against Payne is in court. Writing in New York magazine on Dec. 1, Suki Kim disclosed problems that John Hockenberry, host of New York Public Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d who is white, had with black female co-hosts on a show designed to spotlight diversity.\n\nSeparately, veteran Chicago rock critic Jim DeRogatis reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, held as if in a cult. \u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said,\u201d according to Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post.\n\nFinally, Gawker published it. Kelly has insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it, Sullivan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in October for splinternews.com, Michael Arceneaux asked, \u201cWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes?\n\nThe answer may lie in who his victims are. \u201cThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like [Hollywood mogul Harvey] Weinstein and [the late Fox News founder Roger] Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, four female journalists, including former Detroit Free Press photographer Regina Boone, filed a federal lawsuit against the Free Press and its parent company, Gannett, alleging pay discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. \u2018Suspension\u2019 of Roland Martin\u2019s \u2018NewsOne Now\u2019\n\nAfter four years, the black-owned TV One cable network pulled \u201cNewsOne Now With Roland Martin,\u201d the only black-oriented daily television news program, saying in a December announcement that it is \u201cworking to restructure NewsOne Now in 2018 under a new format that will better serve its audience and advertisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision baffled many, especially since the program was expanded from one hour to two in the year\u2019s third quarter. TV One had proclaimed that the show had experienced \u201csix consecutive quarters of growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff wrap party for the last episode of NewsOne Now with Roland Martin was not supposed to feel like it did,\u201d Jason Johnson wrote for The Root.\n\n\u201cI walked into the staff kitchen and saw Martin in all of his fuchsia glory, smiling, ascot crisp, happily chopping it up. \u2018What\u2019s up, baby?\u2019 he said, then hit me with a hug like we were at Essence Fest or the Republican convention, not the last day of an award-winning TV show. . . . The more people I talked to, the more obvious it\u2019s became that nobody knew for sure why NewsOne Now was going off the air, but the one thing on which they did agree was that black folks were going to be the worse for it. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. FCC Aligns Itself With Big Media\n\nIn \u201can awful new low\u201d that elicited warnings about \u201ca new wave of media consolidation,\u201d the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rolled back media ownership regulations under the guise of trying \u201cto modernize its broadcast ownership rules & to help promote ownership diversity,\u201d Jessica Corbett wrote Nov. 16 for Common Dreams.\n\n\u201c \u2018Any pretense that this vote will help journalism or increase ownership diversity is cynical and offensive,\u2019 said Free Press president and CEO Craig Aaron, warning that the move will \u2018lead to more mergers, more layoffs, and more communities that have no news outlets in place to cover important stories and hold officials accountable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe approved order:\n\n\u201cEliminates newspaper/broadcast and radio/television cross-ownership rules, which imposed restrictions on owning multiple media outlets in the same market;\n\n\u201cRelaxes rules about local television ownership \u2014 including joint sales agreements, which allow a company to control news operations at several stations in one market, where stations would typically compete against each other; and [formally] requests \u2018comment on how to design and implement\u2019 an FCC diversity incubator program. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe order comes as local news becomes more precious. \u201cAs local newspapers have closed across the country, more and more communities are left with no daily local news outlet at all,\u201d Yemile Bucay, Vittoria Elliott, Jennie Kamin and Andrea Park wrote for the spring 2017 issue of Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nIn December, the FCC scrapped so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content.\n\nStanding with other progressive organizations, the NAACP said it \u201cis staunchly opposed to any attempt to censor or manipulate information on the internet, especially if it creates a barrier to entry for people of color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalists of color associations have long opposed media consolidation. In 2014, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists joined others in a letter opposing joint sales agreements, saying, \u201cThese arrangements have harmed communities of color by leading to the elimination of local newscasts and employment opportunities for journalists of color. Furthermore, they have reduced the opportunities for people of color to own broadcast stations. . . . \u201c\n\nProponents say the arrangements actually save jobs by allowing for financially healthier broadcast companies. Armstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who has benefited from such agreements as owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, wrote in Broadcasting & Cable in December, \u201cbroadcast ownership has permitted Howard Stirk Holdings to create an incubator for African American journalism students by providing tuition scholarships, while providing field experience outside of the classroom. If we were not broadcast owners, I am sure none of that would have been possible. . . .\u201d\n\nAlso at issue is a proposed merger of Sinclair Broadcasting, which owns 193 stations, with Tribune Media, which has 42.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer FCC commissioner Michael Copps \u201csaid the deal would eviscerate local TV news and help inflict \u2018irreparable damage,\u2019 \u201c John Eggerton reported in August for Broadcasting & Cable.\n\n\u201cHe called Sinclair the \u2018most dangerous company most Americans have never heard of.\u2019 He said the company wants to skirt ownership regulations with more \u2018joint evasion agreements.\u2019 He said the company comes with an ideology more focused on conservative points of view than \u2018any sense of balance of deep-dive journalism.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The Numbers\n\nThe news industry enters 2018 approaching the 50th anniversary March 1 of the Kerner Commission report, officially the report of the presidentially appointed National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.\n\nThe examination of the causes of the 1967 urban uprisings said that \u201cfewer than 5 percent of the people employed by the news business in the United States today are Negroes\u201d and that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the American Society of News Editors\u2019 annual diversity survey of newspapers and online outlets (but not broadcasters) found that journalists of color comprised 16.6 percent of the workforce in responding U.S. newsrooms.\n\nIn local television news, the workforce rose to 24.4 percent people of color, Bob Papper reported in his annual survey for the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University.\n\n\u201cStill, as far as minorities are concerned, the bigger picture remains unchanged,\u201d Papper wrote. \u201cIn the last 27 years, the minority population in the U.S. has risen 12.1 points; but the minority workforce in TV news is up just over half that at 6.6. And the minority workforce in radio is less than 1 point higher. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMizell Stewart III, then president of the American Society of News Editors, wrote members in May, \u201cThe lack of progress is palpable because the continuing transformation of media business models has led to dramatic reductions in newsroom employment, particularly at local newspapers.\n\n\u201cIn many legacy news organizations, moving the needle on staff diversity took a back seat to the survival of the enterprise. . . .\u201d ASNE is emphasizing diversity at the leadership level with its \u201cEmerging Leaders Institutes.\u201d\n\nStill, there were initiatives as well as setbacks.\n\nNew America Media, which described itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s first and largest collaboration of and advocate for ethnic, community, minority, and bilingual media sources,\u201d closed Nov. 30 after 45 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism said it hopes to fill the gap.\n\nThe Gizmodo Media Group announced that 50 percent of its workforce is of color, and the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, representing the overwhelmingly white alternative press, said it would conduct a demographic survey of newspaper staff. However, African American columnists Barry Saunders of the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and Shaun King of the Daily News in New York, parted company with their employers.

Might the story have led the news, would stories have been more extensive? Most critical, would reporters have pushed government officials to provide acceptable answers? Those who made decisions on what stories to cover and how to do so will doubtlessly insist that race played no part in their decision making, that such factors were not considered at all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Jemele Hill Saga Prompts Warnings About Twitter\n\n\u201cOn Monday, Jemele Hill returns to The Six after a two-week suspension for violating ESPN\u2019s social media policy,\u201d Bryan Curtis wrote on Oct. 22 for theringer.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a key meeting happened Sunday, when Hill sat down with ESPN president John Skipper. According to two sources, the meeting occurred away from the Bristol campus; Hill and Skipper were alone. . . . It was the first time the two met since September 13, two days after Hill called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter and the day that the Trump White House called for her to be fired. As Hill wrote in The Undefeated, she cried during that meeting.\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s suspension is both ESPN bureaucratic intrigue and a national political cause that has been joined by everyone from J.R. Smith to the ACLU. . . .\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 2, Jeremy Barr wrote for the Hollywood Reporter that, \u201cthe network publicly released a new set of social media guidelines that deal with social and political issues. The effort was led by Kevin Merida, the former Washington Post managing editor who runs the ESPN property The Undefeated. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA section of the guidelines deal specifically with commentaries. ESPN employees are told: \u2018Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. ... We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile Skipper told Sports Business Daily that the guidelines were not released in response to Hill\u2019s case, Hill initially got in trouble for writing on Twitter that Donald Trump is a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which would likely be considered \u2018inflammatory rhetoric\u2019 under the new guidelines. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Ebony\u2019s New Ownership Disappoints\n\nPerhaps no development created more disappointment among black journalists than the unrealized promise of Ebony magazine under its new owner, Clear View Group, a black-owned Texas company.\n\nAlong with Fox News, Ebony was awarded this year\u2019s Thumbs Down Award from the National Association of Black Journalists. NABJ said the magazine \u201chas made headlines this year because of staff cuts; the relocation of its headquarters from its founding base in Chicago to Los Angeles [actually, only editorial offices were relocated there]; and, its very public and sometimes offensive responses to reports of late or non-payment for work already performed by staff or freelance journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Many of the decisions being made by Ebony\u2019s new owners seem counter to the vision of founder John H. Johnson,\u2019 said NABJ Vice President of Print Marlon A. Walker. \u2018Ebony and its sister publication Jet are near and dear to us. To hear writers whose words bring us much joy aren\u2019t being paid for those words is sad, unconscionable, unacceptable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nEbony received a constant stream of negative publicity almost since Clear View purchased the magazine in 2016 from the Johnson Publishing Co., headed by Linda Johnson Rice, daughter of the founders. Writers filed suit over nonpayment and personnel have frequently changed.\n\nTracey M. Ferguson, who in February was named editor-in-chief of a revived Jet magazine, then in May was also given the editorship of Ebony, left the company, Ferguson confirmed in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Writers Union said in December it is in court representing 48 freelancers who are owed more than $80,000 by Ebony, and says its next court date is Friday.\n\n8. Investigative Reporting Gets a Boost\n\nIn June, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $150,000 to the new Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting to expand its training programs aimed at supporting journalists of color interested in that crucial specialty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There are a lot of journalists of color who want to be doing [investigative] reporting, but don\u2019t see a path for themselves and have never seen other journalists of color doing this job,\u2019 New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, one of the Ida B. Wells Society\u2019s co-founders, told my colleague Ricardo Bilton earlier this year,\u201d Joseph Lichterman wrote then for Nieman Report.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018When you learn about journalism heroes in college, they are white \u2014 usually white men. It\u2019s important that journalists of color see themselves in these positions and get to be trained by people whose experiences are similar to theirs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUncovering wrongdoing is one of the basic missions of journalistic organizations, one that can best be fulfilled by media with the resources, commitment and experience to give consumers more than opinion pieces and rewriting of others\u2019 work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Kerner Commission took the news media to task 50 years ago, insisting that \u201cthey must make a reality of integration \u2014 in both their product and personnel,\u201d it also said, \u201cthey must report the travail of our cities with compassion and in depth\u201d [PDF \u2014 Go to Chapter 15].\n\nIn too many cases, the investigative reporting listed below \u2014 just a few examples \u2014 did not involve journalists of color. But in most cases, it did make life better for people of color, or strive to.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution all undertook series examining race relations in their cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, the Marshall Project and the Washington Post \u201crevealed that 19 state juvenile-justice agencies regularly or sometimes require parents to pay for the cost of their children\u2019s incarcerations. Counties in another 28 states also routinely engage in the practice,\u201d Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, wrote to email subscribers. \u201cThe City of Philadelphia, where the story was focused, announced a few hours after our story was published that it would end the practice of charging parents who have kids in detention. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, the Miami Herald reported on \u201cFight Club,\u201d a multimedia investigative series that focused on Florida\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. \u201cThe Herald investigation revealed a system rife with problems: Staffers organized and bet on fights between kids; workers were hired despite their criminal backgrounds; 12 juvenile detainees died in state care since 2000,\u201d Deirdra Funcheon noted in Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer wrote about prison corruption in North Carolina, prompting a state review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Jodi S. Cohen and Jennifer Smith Richards reported for the Chicago Tribune that \u201cChicago officers found at fault for misconduct have escaped punishment for years because authorities lost track of their cases, a Tribune investigation has found.\u201d\n\nThe Commercial Appeal in Memphis looked at Memphis\u2019 broadening epidemic of gun assaults, in which 7,000 people had been murdered on Memphis streets since 1960.\n\nThe investigations extended overseas.

A Transition in Indian Country\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian Country Today Media Network, the most comprehensive source of original reporting about Native Americans, \u201cis taking a hiatus to consider alternative business models,\u201d Publisher Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation announced on Sept. 4.\n\n\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians announced the next month that is assuming control of the assets of Indian Country Today Media Network, the result of a donation to the organization by the Oneida nation.\n\nNo one can debate the need for strong reporting from Indian Country. \u201cThere is no doubt that Standing Rock changed the way national media outlets think about Indian Country,\u201d Graham Lee Brewer wrote in November for High Country News.\u201dMore than a year after thousands of people gathered to stop the construction of an oil pipeline over Sioux protests, the desire to tell the stories of Indigenous communities is stronger than ever. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t enough publications that know how to tell those stories accurately. Yes, many of these accounts are technically factual, but media have a hard time, even today, properly representing Native communities across the country. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Atlantic magazine\u2019s acclaimed January/February cover story \u201cMy President Was Black\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates mistakenly reported that \u201cAfrican Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that dubious distinction belongs to Native Americans. Their omission is \u201cfairly common,\u201d Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, president of the Native American Journalists Association, told Journal-isms.\n\nIn good news for Native people, \u201cThe Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde joined an increasing number of other Native American Tribes nationwide in adopting an Independent Press Ordinance that will codify that the Tribal news publication has the independence to report Grand Ronde news objectively and free from undue political influence by Tribal elected officials,\u201d the Native American Journalists Association announced last January from Grand Ronde, Ore.\n\nThe news is significant because \u201ca free press is the exception and not the rule\u201d in Indian Country, Pollard said then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.

A few hours later, Harmon walked into a nearby church bloodied, bruised and discombobulated, wearing nothing but her underwear.\n\nAccording to the Herald-Democrat, Harmon told the police that she was kidnapped by three black males wearing ski masks and gloves. Harmon explained how the roving band of masked thugs, obviously roaming the area looking for white women to defile, snatched the 18-year-old out of her car, took her to a wooded area and gang-raped her.\n\nBut Harmon bravely fended off the imaginary Negroes in an epic knife fight from which she luckily escaped with only a few scratches on her legs. She fled to the church and recounted her story to officers, who began searching for the African rape squad before they could attack another white woman.\n\nThe alleged rape of an innocent white girl angered people in the community and around the country. Everyone began searching for the evil men who stole Harmon\u2019s purity after her mom made a Facebook post:\n\nThis is going to be a brutally honest post. Today my daughter, Breana Harmon Talbott was taken by force by 3 black men. 2 raped her and she is cut head to toe by a knife. They took her engagement ring, her class ring, her earrings, her baby T necklace, everything she had on. She was able to run and ran into a church, bleeding from head to toe with no pants on. Someone had to have saw something!!! This town is small, if anyone, anyone hears ANYTHING, please call the denison police department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though no one claims to \u201chave saw something,\u201d the alt-right began explaining how they had been warning the world all along about how black men, unable to control their animalistic lust for legal-envelope-shaped Caucasian cakes, often satisfied their savage urges by raping white girls.\n\nSome folks brainstormed solutions for this raging epidemic, posting, \u201cWhites need a mafia \u2026 so if you want to rape a white girl like Breana Talbott the white mafia finds you and your family and puts you down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs police investigated, they wondered why Harmon\u2019s bruises were not consistent with being in a violent knife attack. Even more curiously, a nurse who examined Harmon said that there was no physical evidence of sexual assault, and did not think that she had been assaulted.\n\nAfter police questioned black men in the area and were unable to find the three-man white-girl rape team, Harmon eventually confessed that she might have made up the part about the black men. And the part about being kidnapped. And the part about being raped.\n\nHarmon admitted that she had cut herself and her jeans because she was upset about possibly breaking up with her boyfriend. When she realized that her mom might be upset about the jeans, Harmon said, she just made up the stuff about the group of masked rapists because ... well ... you know\u2014they\u2019re black. I\u2019m sure everyone can understand that siccing the police on black men is less stressful than having Mommy yell for a few minutes about ripping a perfectly good pair of Old Navy dungarees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Harmon pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony counts of tampering with physical evidence, a third-degree felony count of tampering with a government record and a state-jail felony count of tampering with a government record. The charges meant that Harmon faced 30 years in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very remorseful for what she did and what she said, and that\u2019s why she decided to plead guilty,\u201d Harmon\u2019s attorney, Bob Jarvis, explained, noting that the plea deal means that Harmon will not serve a day behind bars. \u201cThe cap is either regular probation or deferred adjudication,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll be asking for deferred and they\u2019ll be asking for regular probation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, deferred adjudication means that Harmon will enter a guilty plea, but it will not be listed as a conviction. Upon successful completion of a period of community supervision, the charges against Harmon will be technically dismissed. Furthermore, Harmon will be able to file for nondisclosure after her period of supervision that \u201cessentially seals the criminal record of the offense from private entities,\u201d legal advocate website Avvo states. \u201cThis keeps potential employers, apartment complexes, and many others from knowing about the offense.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding whether or not Harmon receives probation or deferred adjudication, her lawyer plans to present the extenuating circumstances of the case, including some of the things she was going through at the time.\n\nAs of the date of publication, The Root was unable to reach a representative from the mythical masked black rape clique running around Denison, Texas, searching for blondes to desecrate.

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps? Could it have something to do with Trump\u2019s fake daughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks is set to met with members of the House Intelligence Committee, CNN reports. In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election. Yes, there are multiple investigations into possible Russia collusion because, well, Russia colluded.\n\nHicks served as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 before moving into her new role. Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning. I assume that he tweeted this right before his morning ritual of sacrificing a baby goat and poking pins in his stuffed Obama doll.\n\n#StayWoke.", "keywords": ["president", "pleaded", "morning", "investigation", "trumps", "heating", "guilty", "proves", "trump", "russian", "election", "russia", "latest"], "polarity": -0.010199283475145537, "subjectivity": 0.47683982683982684},

Twenty years later, the goal was changed to 2025. As with the previous goal, it is unlikely to be met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, Hispanics or Latinos were 16.3 percent of the U.S. population; blacks or African Americans were 12.6 percent; Asians 4.8 percent; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders 0.2 percent; and Native Americans or Alaska Natives 0.9 percent. The census counted 6.2 percent as \u201csome other race\u201d and 2.9 percent as two or more races.\n\n\u201cASNE also announced its new partnership with the Google News Lab, which has produced data visualizations of this year\u2019s survey results and historical data dating back to 2001,\u201d the ASNE release continued. \u201cThe News Lab\u2019s newly launched interactive website (goo.gl/trends/asne) will serve as a visual archive of the ASNE survey data, in addition to the ASNE website at asne.org.\n\n\u201cThe annual survey also found that 25.5 percent of the news organizations reported having at least one minority journalist among their top three editors, and 74.8 percent reported having at least one woman in a top-three position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe results summarize responses from 661 news organizations, including 598 newspapers and 63 online-only news websites. . . .\u201d\n\nIn a statement, outgoing ASNE President Mizell Stewart III, vice president of news operations for Gannett and the USA Today Network, highlighted the organization\u2019s emphasis on leadership training as a key to newsroom diversity. \u201cWe are seeing encouraging growth trends in the percentage of minorities and women in the top ranks of newsroom leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cASNE believes that diverse leaders build diverse newsrooms, and our organization\u2019s professional development efforts are oriented toward that goal.\u201d\n\nThe group also said, \u201cEarlier today, ASNE announced a $300,000 grant from the Democracy Fund, which will help create a more comprehensive and data-driven survey that catalogues newsroom diversity numbers for U.S. print and online publications. The Google News Lab and Knight Foundation are also key supporters of the annual survey. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlfredo Carbajal, managing editor of Al Dia, Spanish-language product of the Dallas Morning News, succeeds Stewart as ASNE president.\n\nState Dept., White House Differ on Media Issues\n\nDespite President Trump\u2019s demonization of the U.S. news media as an \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d the State Department is pushing back on governments overseas that seek to limit press freedom and is insisting that a free press is a cornerstone of American values and of democracy, State Department officials said Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose officials, speaking at an all-day briefing for members of the American Society of News Editors, chiefly editorial writers, also pointed to what the department spokesperson called an under-covered story: North Korea forcing some of its citizens to work for free overseas in what the department said amounts to modern-day slavery.\n\n\n\n\u201cA significant portion of their wages are taken by the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] government, which has prioritized the extremely expensive nuclear and ballistic missile development over humanitarian needs of the North Korean people,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe split in attitudes toward press freedom represented another difference between Trump and his State Department, whose leader, Secretary Rex Tillerson, is said to have called Trump a moron. In another split, the department said it favored a free and open internet, yet Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission appointed by Trump, has proposed eliminating net neutrality rules. The FCC is an independent agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPresident Trump started and ended his day Wednesday by lashing out at NBC and other American television networks,\u201d Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter reported Wednesday for CNN Money. \u201cHe explicitly threatened the press by saying on Twitter that \u2018network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was a follow-up to the morning missive that reflected his fury over an NBC News report that said he wanted a tenfold increase in the United States\u2019 nuclear arsenal. He decried \u2018fake news coming out of NBC and the Networks\u2019 and asked \u2018At what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nIn response, the National Association of Broadcasters, a trade group, said it was contrary to First Amendment principles \u201cfor any government official to threaten the revocation of an FCC license simply because of a disagreement with the reporting of a journalist,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a panel discussion Monday at the News Leadership Conference of the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and Associated Press Photo Managers, international journalists said that Trump\u2019s attacks on the U.S. media were emboldening authoritarian rulers overseas. They urged the U.S. government to speak out forcefully in defense of press freedom.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s State Department briefing, attended by 31 journalists, officials insisted that they were already doing so. Francisco Palmieri, acting assistant secretary of the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, criticized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in part by saying the U.S. opposes \u201cany attempt to silence reporters\u201d and advocates making \u201cfreedom of speech a right in all countries.\u201d\n\nHeather Nauert, the State Department spokesperson, said it is her practice to \u201cspeak out at press briefings\u201d about nations that abuse reporters, citing Turkey as an example. Thomas Grove reported Wednesday for the Wall Street Journal that a \u201cTurkish court sentenced Wall Street Journal reporter Ayla Albayrak to two years and one month in prison Tuesday, declaring her guilty of engaging in terrorist propaganda in support of a banned Kurdish separatist organization through one of her Journal articles. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, a member of \u201cthe bullpen,\u201d the State Department press corps, would face persecution if the journalist returned home, Nauert said. She also said the Trump administration raised freedom-of-speech issues recently in meetings with the Chinese.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists reported last December that the 259 journalists in jail worldwide represented the highest number recorded since 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA State Department official followed up by email on Nauert\u2019s statement about North Korea\u2019s use of forced labor.\n\n\u201cThe conditions in which many North Korean overseas laborers work fall far below international labor standards,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cNorth Korean workers overseas are often subjected to conditions that may amount to forced labor, including working 12-16 hours per day with only one or two rest days a month and being confined to their quarters during non-work hours.\n\n\u201cNorth Koreans sent overseas do not have a choice in the work; the government ultimately assigns them and they are not free to change jobs. Their wages and passports are typically withheld by North Korean supervisors, and they face threats of government reprisals against them or their relatives in the DPRK if they attempt to escape or complain to outside parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs Secretary Tillerson stated at this year\u2019s rollout of the Trafficking in Persons Report, the North Korean regime receives hundreds of millions of dollars per year from the fruits of forced labor. Responsible nations simply cannot allow this to go on, and we continue to call on any nation that is hosting workers from North Korea to take further action to end this practice.\u201d\n\nThe department then asked and answered its own question.\n\n\u201cQ: What does the Department think about the fact that what they\u2019re making ends up in US markets and stores?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe import of goods produced by forced labor is prohibited by U.S. law. Under the recently adopted Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), significant goods made with North Korean labor, including outside North Korea, is presumed to be made with forced labor.\u201d\n\nSteven Borowiec, Los Angeles Times: North Koreans perform $975 million worth of forced labor each year (Oct. 6, 2016)\n\nThe Guardian: Countries hosting North Korean workers may be breaching UN sanctions (Dec. 31, 2014)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuman Rights Watch: North Korea: End Rampant Forced Child Labor (Feb. 13)\n\nChris Kahn, Reuters: The press, branded the \u2018enemy\u2019 by Trump, increasingly trusted by the public: Reuters/Ipsos poll (Oct. 3)\n\nEssence, People en Espa\u00f1ol in Time Inc. Cutbacks\n\nTime Inc. is cutting back on the circulation and frequency of some of its biggest titles, part of a far-reaching cost-reduction and restructuring program meant to ensure the profitability of its core brands, Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg reported Tuesday for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to news reports, Essence magazine will be published 10 issues a year instead of 12, and People en Espa\u00f1ol will lower its circulation from 540,000 to 500,000 and cut two of its issues to print nine a year.\n\n\u201cThe company gradually will reduce the weekly circulation of its flagship Time magazine by one-third to 2 million copies,\u201d Talking New Media reported. \u201cThat move is partly a recognition that it isn\u2019t worth it to keep printing as many promotional copies. It also is aimed at focusing on a core audience considered more valuable to advertisers.\n\n\u201cTime Inc. also is reducing the print frequency of seven titles, including Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly and Fortune. The move is based, in part, on its research showing that consumers have less time for leaning back with magazines.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrachtenberg reported in July that Time is looking to sell its majority stake in Essence, adding that Rich Battista, Time Inc.\u2019s chief executive, told Trachtenberg that he hopes to complete a transaction by the end of the year.\n\nWhites Awarded for Stories on Black Communities\n\nMolly Parker, a white reporter at the Southern Illinoisan in Carbondale, Ill., told journalists Tuesday that when she first visited neglected housing units in Cairo, Ill., \u201cI cried all the way home.\u201d The city had been the victim of racism, greed and corruption, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe housing, eventually taken over by the federal government after reporting by her newspaper, was built in 1942 on the site of a contraband camp, \u201ccontraband\u201d being 19th century language for freed or fugitive slaves.\n\nThe Southern, as it is known, won a community journalism award from the Associated Press Media Editors, presented at the News Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nAt the same conference, a panel discussion commemorated the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Kerner Commission report on the urban uprisings of the 1960s. That panel, moderated by this columnist and including veteran journalists Paul Delaney, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, Dorothy Gilliam and Al Fitzpatrick, discussed progress in newsroom diversity (Facebook Live video) in the years since the commission declared in 1968 that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt said that the news media bore some responsibility for the uprisings partly because \u201cthey have not communicated to the majority of their audience \u2014 which is white \u2014 a sense of the degradation, misery, and hopelessness of living in the ghetto. . . .\u201d\n\nThe awards ceremony Tuesday, which featured awards from APME and the American Society of News Editors, demonstrated that the news industry has increased its coverage of black communities.\n\nSeveral other winning investigations reported on African Americans, such as \u201cBeyond the Bullet\u201d by a team from the Associated Press, which followed a boy\u2019s adjustment to a new life in the aftermath of being shot on the streets of Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, judging from those winners, the news business has not put African Americans in a position to report those stories, particularly if they are of the prize-winning investigative sort.\n\nStephen Henderson, editorial page editor and columnist for the Detroit Free Press, was the only African American to accept an award, and his was for commentary/column writing.\n\nFor that reason, the New York Times Magazine\u2019s Nikole Hannah-Jones and others last year helped launch the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, \u201ca training and mentorship organization that aims to increase the numbers and retention rate of reporters and editors of color in newsrooms,\u201d as Ricardo Bilton wrote in February for Nieman Lab. \u201c. . . . The group is based on the idea that while investigative reporting is some of the most critical work journalists do, few of the people doing that work are non-white \u2014 a failure that Hannah-Jones says leaves a lot of stories uncovered or under-covered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSignificantly, the Robert G. McGruder Award for Diversity Leadership went posthumously to John C. Quinn, former editor-in-chief of USA Today, who understood the dynamics of diversity in its various dimensions.\n\n\u201cHe and Al Neuharth, who at that time headed Gannett, were firmly committed to diversity \u2014 certainly because it was the right thing to do but also because it was the smart thing to do,\u201d said Phil Currie, retired senior vice president for news at Gannett Co., accepting the award for Quinn. \u201cThe Gannett directive that \u2018Our leadership should reflect our readership\u2019 was one John not only talked about frequently but believed in deeply and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 executed faithfully.\n\n\u201cUnder John and his successors, the Gannett Company\u2019s diversity numbers were usually the best in the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe even encouraged a bit of competition with our friends from Knight-Ridder, who also were committed to the cause. That rivalry helped boost diversity efforts nationwide.\n\n\u201cIt also should be noted that building diverse staffs was often especially challenging on small community newspapers, of which Gannett had many. But John\u2019s insistence that all voices be represented made a difference everywhere. . . .\u201d\n\nText of Currie\u2019s remarks at the end of this column.\n\nRussell Contreras, Associated Press: Last Kerner Commission member haunted, hopeful on race in US\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHoward University: Video of Kerner Commission panel at News Leadership Conference: Video Video_2 Video_3\n\nCollier Meyerson, Columbia Journalism Review: Covering a country where race is everywhere\n\nMolly Parker, Southern Illinoisan: Report finds 1,376 health, safety issues at Elmwood and McBride properties\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy It\u2019s So Hard for Some to Relate to Voters\n\nNewsrooms full of college-educated white people who don\u2019t relate to the culture of the average Joe or Jane in \u201cflyover country\u201d are in part responsible for the failure of the news media to see a Donald Trump victory coming last year, according to panelists from the heartland who spoke at the News Leadership Conference in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Southern white men would rather vote for a black man as president than a Hillary Clinton, Michael Williamson, a white Washington Post photographer who thinks of himself as blue collar, said \u2014 and did. \u201cAt least he\u2019s a dude,\u201d one told him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re ready for a woman president,\u201d a woman said to Claire Galofaro, a white Associated Press correspondent who documents rural America. Many women aren\u2019t as concerned with breaking glass ceilings as in having food on the table and a husband with a job, they said. The economic recovery under former president Barack Obama did not touch everyone.\n\nRochelle Riley, an African American columnist with the Detroit Free Press, said some editors are more interested in \u201cfinding stories about black people that white people want to read\u201d than in those about black people as they are. \u201cIf we can\u2019t see how people are living, you don\u2019t have any connection. That\u2019s how newspapers die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnie Schultz, a white, Pulitzer-winning columnist for Creators Syndicate from Ohio, was more blunt. \u201cThere are too many white editors,\u201d she said. Some journalists of color just give up trying to persuade them to pursue more relevant stories. A former journalist at the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Schultz also said she saw a change in what was considered newsworthy when the education level rose in the newsroom.\n\nTo Schultz, journalists have a role in bringing people together. She was dismayed when few whites showed up for the funeral of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old black boy fatally shot in 2015 by police who said they thought his pellet gun was real. She cast the tragedy as one to which mothers of any race could relate, but said it had not been framed that way.\n\n\u201cIf a kid dies anywhere in this country, that\u2019s one of my kids,\u201d Riley agreed. She also urged reporters to pay more attention to black women, whose voter turnout dropped in the 2016 election, compared with 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliamson said his editors send him to trailer-park stories because he relates well with blue-collar people. \u201cThey ask, \u2018How do you know the code?\u2019 \u201c He said it was simply pointing out to his subjects how much they have in common. \u201cThey always say, \u2018I didn\u2019t know what a Washington Post reporter would look like,\u2019 imagining a Bob Woodward, \u2018but you don\u2019t look like it.\u2019 They say that in a good way. When I went to Iowa, they said, \u2018I ain\u2019t talking to you. You\u2019re the liberal piece of shit\u2019 \u201c who looks down on them. He said they feel invisible. But he gains their confidence with his demeanor and by keeping the discussion on their talking points, not his.\n\nWilliamson also said he doesn\u2019t argue. To those who believed that Obama wasn\u2019t born in this country, Williamson said he just marvels with them at how Obama was able to keep hidden all the paperwork that enabled him to conceal that he wasn\u2019t really born in the United States. \u201cYeah, it is kind of ridiculous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d they reply.\n\nWhat is often called racial is actually economic, Williamson said. Many will say they disagree with what Trump says, but they cannot afford not to back him if there was a 1 percent chance he can deliver on reopening a plant. Trump \u201cunderstood the common guy\u2019s hopes and fears and he plays them,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaddie Biertempfel, newsleaders2017.com (convention student project): Covering Economic Diversity: What we missed\n\nPublic Editor Says Suspension of Hill is Worrisome\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe uneasy relationship between Jemele Hill and ESPN spilled into public view again Monday, as the network suspended the SportsCenter anchor for two weeks after a series of tweets over the weekend in which she criticized a few NFL team owners and suggested a boycott of Dallas Cowboys advertisers,\u201d Jim Brady, ESPN\u2019s public editor, wrote Wednesday.\n\n\u201cESPN announced the suspension with a Monday afternoon tweet.\n\n\u201cWhile the statement wasn\u2019t at all specific, it\u2019s clear the tweets about an advertiser boycott were the trigger. It\u2019s not hard to put the pieces together and interpret ESPN\u2019s position:\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s mentioning of an advertiser boycott and criticism of league owners reflected negatively on ESPN, hence the suspension. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrady also wrote, \u201cBut when it comes to this latest action by ESPN, I am a bit perplexed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I understand exactly what it is that upset ESPN about Hill\u2019s actions: One of its highest-profile personalities suggested an advertiser boycott that would impact an important network partner, and she did so on Twitter, the same platform she used to call out Trump. And, make no mistake: Many of the NFL\u2019s advertisers are also ESPN advertisers.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the calling for a boycott \u2014 or, at least, a strong encouragement of it \u2014 treads close to activism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not the job of Hill \u2014 or any other ESPN journalist, for that matter \u2014 to concern herself with the network\u2019s business relationships. . . .

Here are Currie\u2019s remarks:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn behalf of John Quinn and his family, I am honored to accept this prestigious award.All who knew John sincerely thank you for recognizing his outstanding and longstanding diversity leadership.\n\n\n\nJohn Collins Quinn was a personally delightful and professionally dedicated newsman with a great heart.\n\nHe made his mark on the industry as chief news executive of the Gannett Company and later as editor of USA TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had the privilege of working directly with him for some 20 years. I saw how the diversity seeds he sowed blossomed and spread throughout the company and the country.\n\nHe and Al Neuharth, who at that time headed Gannett, were firmly committed to diversity \u2013 certainly because it was the right thing to do but also because it was the smart thing to do. The Gannett directive that \u201cOur leadership should reflect our readership\u201d was one John not only talked about frequently but believed in deeply and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 executed faithfully.\n\nUnder John and his successors, the Gannett Company\u2019s diversity numbers were usually the best in the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe even encouraged a bit of competition with our friends from Knight-Ridder, who also were committed to the cause. That rivalry helped boost diversity efforts nationwide.\n\nIt also should be noted that building diverse staffs was often especially challenging on small community newspapers, of which Gannett had many. But John\u2019s insistence that all voices be represented made a difference everywhere.\n\nSo did an All-American review that John began in Gannett with the help of Jay Harris, a national leader in building diversity. The aim was not simply to have minority members on news staffs but to have diverse voices in news columns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat meant that experts of color in various fields were called on for comments along with the usual white counterparts. Newsroom staffs developed diverse source lists, and content was expected to reflect many voices.\n\nWhen Gannett launched USA TODAY as the nation\u2019s newspaper, it also sought to make staffing and content represent all aspects of our society.\n\nSome argued that this was \u201cformula journalism.\u201d John saw it as making sure the newspaper was reflecting the full spectrum of our country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis firm belief in the value of diversity \u2014 demonstrated by both his corporate commitment and his personal approaches \u2014 was reflected throughout the company in its newsroom leadership and in its publications.\n\nA culture developed that inspired many of us working with John. His diversity aims became shared by a great number of Gannett editors, no matter their race.\n\nIt is significant, I think, that since the McGruder Award\u2019s inauguration in 2002, eight Gannett editors and two Gannett newspapers are among the winners.All can thank John.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, as the video noted, after his retirement in 1990 and the death of his son Chips (who also was an editor), John and his late wife Loie established the Chips Quinn Scholars Program to provide journalism training, internships and ongoing mentoring to college students of color. More than 1,400 have gone through that program. It continues today, with nearly half of its graduates still in news careers.\n\nJohn Quinn died July 11 at age 91. He was a man who cared deeply, inspired broadly and made good things happen nationally. He was, indeed, a Diversity Leader.\n\nAll who knew him shall miss him, and all who have labored in media \u2014 and their readers, viewers and listeners who benefited from diverse content \u2014 owe him our deep gratitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for this award, I know John would have been thrilled to receive it. And as a past president of both APME [Associated Press Media Editors] and ASNE, he would be very pleased to know that this topic still matters to these organizations.\n\nOn his behalf, for that I also say thank you.\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

Not President Donald Trump, though; he\u2019s out stunting, bashing the armed school security officer for not running into the school to save the kids, and of course, making everything about himself.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I\u2019d run in there, even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,\u201d Trump told a gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a test; you don\u2019t even have to pull out a pen and paper\u2014Trump would fail, miserably. This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["president", "likely", "bunch", "shooter", "save", "kids", "hes", "presidents", "trump", "afraid", "run", "school"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

I was in New York City for an Essence magazine photo shoot and feature on relationship bloggers\u2014a collective that included Demetria Lucas (A Belle in Brooklyn), Jozen Cummings (Until I Get Married) and Anslem Samuel (Naked With Socks On).\n\nThe shoot was at 5. I got downtown early so I could stop at McDonald\u2019s and grab something before heading up to Essence, which lets you know I still considered McDonald\u2019s a viable option for quick food and was still so new to the \u201cdoing things for actual magazines\u201d thing that I didn\u2019t stop to think they\u2019d have much, much, much better food at the shoot, too.\n\nAfter leaving McDonald\u2019s\u2014my head down, double-checking the directions to Essence on my phone\u2014I literally bumped into two women on the sidewalk. I stopped and turned to apologize (and they stopped and turned to wait for it), and we each had an \u201cOh shit!\u201d moment. It was Jamilah Lemieux (whom I\u2019d known for three years already then) and Geneva Thomas (whom I\u2019d never met in person but immediately recognized).\n\nAfter the shock of running into one another so randomly wore off, Jamilah revealed that they just left a meeting at Ebony magazine, where they\u2019d both been hired as part of Ebony\u2019s push to revamp and enhance Ebony.com. She also shared that my name was brought up for some mysterious honor (which I\u2019d later learn was VSB\u2019s placement on Ebony\u2019s 2011 Power 100 list) and that she wanted to call later to discuss something else.\n\nWe talked after I was done with the Essence shoot, and she mentioned that my name was also brought up as a potential writer for Ebony.com and asked if I wanted to work there, too. I told her I\u2019d think about it. Which was a lie, because my real answer was, \u201cHell yeah, fucking right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started there in January 2012\u2014first as a biweekly columnist and a frequent contributor to Black Listed, which aggregated and summarized relevant news stories. After a month, I was put in charge of it and given a bump in pay and a title: contributing editor. This was huge, for reasons both literal and existential.\n\nAlthough VSB already had a decent-sized audience, following and name, it still existed in a relevance purgatory. We were very popular with a very, very, very small group of people and not even on the radar next to the radar with anyone else. If I was asked what I did for a living and I said that I founded and ran a blog called Very Smart Brothas, I\u2019d either get a look that said, \u201cSo basically you live in your aunt\u2019s basement?\u201d or I\u2019d get a follow-up question: \u201cSo what do you REALLY do for a living?\u201d The gig at Ebony and the important-sounding title provided my career an immediate legitimacy that VSB just couldn\u2019t then.\n\nAlso, my Ebony.com workload didn\u2019t require eight-hour days. I needed to be available from 9 to 6, but most days, I only spent maybe three or four hours doing Ebony-related work. Which was a perfect arrangement for me, since it allowed me to continue building VSB while also getting paid to work and learn at Ebony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remained a contributing editor for three years, learning valuable lessons on how to manage a digital magazine and forming close-knit working relationships (and, eventually, friendships) with my colleagues there\u2014Jamilah, Kierna Mayo and Genese Cage in particular. In 2015, when Kierna and Jamilah left digital and were placed in charge of the magazine, they brought me with them. The Colored Section was my first (and still only) regular print-magazine column.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s hyperbole to say that I owe my career to Ebony. But I\u2019m not quite sure if the professional accolades that have come since 2012\u2014most notably the book deal from Ecco (HarperCollins) and VSB becoming valuable enough to be acquired by GMG\u2014would have happened without Ebony\u2019s (and Kierna\u2019s and Jamilah\u2019s in particular) influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also know that when I first read the spate of tweets and articles this year exposing Ebony magazine\u2019s pattern of either paying contributors late or not paying them at all\u2014stories captured by the hashtag #EbonyOwes\u2014I remembered the time a month-late paycheck in late 2012 resulted in a series of mishaps that led to my car getting repossessed. I remember becoming so frustrated with a two-month-long gap in pay in 2014 that I started cc\u2019ing then-CEO Desiree Rogers on the emails I sent to accounts payable, only to receive a terse and unkind reply from Rogers herself on New Year\u2019s Eve, saying (paraphrasing), \u201cYour money will come when it comes.\u201d\n\nAnd I remember being talked out of writing an #EbonyOwes type of piece and publishing it on VSB twice: once when accepting that in doing so, I would probably effectively fire myself from Ebony, and once when I was comfortable enough financially and creatively to burn that bridge but realized that writing that type of piece would just hurt the people I knew who were still there\u2014the writers and editors and even the accounts payable people, who had no control over what the company\u2019s leadership did.\n\nNow Ebony is facing a suit from a group of 38 freelancers alleging $70,000 in unpaid work. (Over the past year, I\u2019ve been asked by several different people if Ebony owes me any money still. My answer is always the same: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d)\n\nIn a cruel irony, the people who are most equipped to freelance are people who don\u2019t actually need to. Who have other sources of income, and aren\u2019t constricted by the immediacy of digital media\u2014allowing them to devote more care to their work\u2014and don\u2019t need to spend a sizable amount of their working hours chasing and stressing over pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quote above is from a piece I wrote earlier this year about the metaphysical control that money\u2014the work for it, the pursuit of it and the lack of it\u2014has on the lives of freelancers. This is a dynamic that large publications happily take advantage of. Some are much, much better than others, but all make use of the fact that there will always be a large pool of people wanting\u2014sometimes wishing and dreaming\u2014to get published on their pages. They are the dealers, and freelancers are the addicts, willing to do whatever the market demands they do because the inherent power imbalance distorts the concept of choice.\n\nI\u2019ve been that freelancer. And I\u2019ve been personally victimized by Ebony. There are few things more embarrassing than calling the police thinking that your car was stolen, only to realize that it was collected (and then the frantic patching together of funds to get it back). But I haven\u2019t felt any schadenfreude about Ebony finally receiving a very public comeuppance. Because as fucked up as Ebony\u2019s leadership in Chicago had been\u2014and as much as I wish that the dozens of unpaid contributors get their money\u2014this spotlight as some singular example of invoicing triflin\u2019ness is somewhat unfair.\n\nIt has not gone unnoticed that Ebony\u2019s financial struggles have received an attention that the editorial successes they had both digitally and in print between 2012 and 2016 did not\u2014achievements largely due to the women mentioned earlier. A recurring frustration that many of these colleagues felt while working at Ebony.com was that their work was done in the dark. The most attention we\u2019d get was when either Hoteps or racists were angry at Jamilah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could write the exact-same article for Ebony.com that I did for VSB, but the piece would get much, much more traffic and engagement on VSB despite the fact that Ebony was paying me. Naturally, some of this was Chicago\u2019s fault for not prioritizing digital. But as I watched #EbonyOwes go viral, I wondered what would have happened if Ebony\u2019s digital (and print) work from that time had been supported and retweeted and shared with the same fervor.\n\nAlso, anyone with any sort of experience freelancing can recite the horror stories of attempting to get paid by platforms large and small, mainstream and predominantly black. Sometimes it\u2019s an unexpected delay in payment. Sometimes you\u2019re asked to work for free. Except instead of \u201cfree,\u201d they\u2019ll say \u201cexposure\u201d or \u201cexperience\u201d or the free chicken and tote bag you\u2019ll get while attending an event. Sometimes you learn that a colleague was paid more to do less work. Sometimes the invoicing process is so labyrinthine and draining, you just say \u201cfuck it\u201d and stop trying to get paid.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s a ginormous media behemoth that has owed me $1,000 for some work I did in February of 2016, and after what felt like the 18,000th different form I had to fill out, I just stopped trying. I spent more effort trying to get paid than I did with what I was supposed to get paid for. But Ebony now stands alone as the scapegoat while platforms with their own shady invoicing histories publish work on their demise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting this feels somewhat anachronistic already because all of the people I knew at Ebony have since moved on, and it\u2019s now owned by different (and inarguably worse) people. The Ebony of 2017 is not your grandmother\u2019s Ebony or the Ebony I worked at, and this feels like a defense of a ghost. Or, even worse: a brand. A brand that doesn\u2019t deserve any sort of attention today other than \u201cFuck you, pay me.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still not even sure why I\u2019m writing this and what I\u2019m attempting to accomplish with it, since I hope that the freelancers suing get every cent owed to them. It\u2019s just sad that corporate mismanagement led to Ebony becoming what it is today: known more for being trifin\u2019 than for the amazing work that was done there. And I\u2019m sad to see so much attention\u2014mostly (and deservedly) negative\u2014devoted to a platform that desperately needed and deserved it when it was still viable.", "keywords": ["id", "piece", "vsb", "digital", "ebonys", "ebonyowes", "shoot", "ebony", "man", "owes", "thoughts", "career", "work", "paid", "ebonycom"], "polarity": 0.07777224446397377, "subjectivity": 0.4868749546193156},

A few hours later, Harmon walked into a nearby church bloodied, bruised and discombobulated, wearing nothing but her underwear.\n\nAccording to the Herald-Democrat, Harmon told the police that she was kidnapped by three black males wearing ski masks and gloves. Harmon explained how the roving band of masked thugs, obviously roaming the area looking for white women to defile, snatched the 18-year-old out of her car, took her to a wooded area and gang-raped her.\n\nBut Harmon bravely fended off the imaginary Negroes in an epic knife fight from which she luckily escaped with only a few scratches on her legs. She fled to the church and recounted her story to officers, who began searching for the African rape squad before they could attack another white woman.\n\nThe alleged rape of an innocent white girl angered people in the community and around the country. Everyone began searching for the evil men who stole Harmon\u2019s purity after her mom made a Facebook post:\n\nThis is going to be a brutally honest post. Today my daughter, Breana Harmon Talbott was taken by force by 3 black men. 2 raped her and she is cut head to toe by a knife. They took her engagement ring, her class ring, her earrings, her baby T necklace, everything she had on. She was able to run and ran into a church, bleeding from head to toe with no pants on. Someone had to have saw something!!! This town is small, if anyone, anyone hears ANYTHING, please call the denison police department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though no one claims to \u201chave saw something,\u201d the alt-right began explaining how they had been warning the world all along about how black men, unable to control their animalistic lust for legal-envelope-shaped Caucasian cakes, often satisfied their savage urges by raping white girls.\n\nSome folks brainstormed solutions for this raging epidemic, posting, \u201cWhites need a mafia \u2026 so if you want to rape a white girl like Breana Talbott the white mafia finds you and your family and puts you down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs police investigated, they wondered why Harmon\u2019s bruises were not consistent with being in a violent knife attack. Even more curiously, a nurse who examined Harmon said that there was no physical evidence of sexual assault, and did not think that she had been assaulted.\n\nAfter police questioned black men in the area and were unable to find the three-man white-girl rape team, Harmon eventually confessed that she might have made up the part about the black men. And the part about being kidnapped. And the part about being raped.\n\nHarmon admitted that she had cut herself and her jeans because she was upset about possibly breaking up with her boyfriend. When she realized that her mom might be upset about the jeans, Harmon said, she just made up the stuff about the group of masked rapists because ... well ... you know\u2014they\u2019re black. I\u2019m sure everyone can understand that siccing the police on black men is less stressful than having Mommy yell for a few minutes about ripping a perfectly good pair of Old Navy dungarees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Harmon pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony counts of tampering with physical evidence, a third-degree felony count of tampering with a government record and a state-jail felony count of tampering with a government record. The charges meant that Harmon faced 30 years in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very remorseful for what she did and what she said, and that\u2019s why she decided to plead guilty,\u201d Harmon\u2019s attorney, Bob Jarvis, explained, noting that the plea deal means that Harmon will not serve a day behind bars. \u201cThe cap is either regular probation or deferred adjudication,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll be asking for deferred and they\u2019ll be asking for regular probation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, deferred adjudication means that Harmon will enter a guilty plea, but it will not be listed as a conviction. Upon successful completion of a period of community supervision, the charges against Harmon will be technically dismissed. Furthermore, Harmon will be able to file for nondisclosure after her period of supervision that \u201cessentially seals the criminal record of the offense from private entities,\u201d legal advocate website Avvo states. \u201cThis keeps potential employers, apartment complexes, and many others from knowing about the offense.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding whether or not Harmon receives probation or deferred adjudication, her lawyer plans to present the extenuating circumstances of the case, including some of the things she was going through at the time.\n\nAs of the date of publication, The Root was unable to reach a representative from the mythical masked black rape clique running around Denison, Texas, searching for blondes to desecrate.

Jose Diaz-Balart was named in 2016 to anchor the Saturday evening edition of \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in a 2015 interview with Journal-isms when he officially became anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d Lester Holt named Jacob Rascon and Miguel Almaguer as among \u201cour go-to rock-star correspondents. Any one of them could be in line the next time that [anchor] job opens up,\u201d Holt said.\n\nNBC pledged to increase its diversity as a condition of NBCUniversal\u2019s merger with Comcast, which won approval from government regulators in 2011.\n\nSubervi\u2019s report conceded that NBC benefited from its affiliation and collaboration with Spanish-language TV network Telemundo. But, it continued, \u201cCNN, in contrast, is worse given that it has almost an hour worth of nightly news in which Latinos could be covered significantly better. As for ABC and CBS, the patterns of coverage are not only limited, but practically unchanged in comparison to what was observed decades ago. . . . \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report concluded: \u201cPrevious NAHJ commissioned studies akin to this one have invariably been critical of the networks\u2019 news coverage of Latinos, while also expressing a desire to help those media outlets improve their coverage of that community and hire more Latino journalists.\n\n\u201cThose reports were then followed by press releases with highlights of the findings, and occasional brief presentations by the authors of the reports (usually at NAHJ conventions). To this author\u2019s knowledge, no action plans were developed and carried through to bring about prompt, positive change. If specific plans were put into place, the findings of this seven-year study suggest that the findings and recommendations of the NAHJ studies or efforts to change the networks\u2019 modus operandi, may have \u2018fallen on deaf ears,\u2019 or simply ignored by the decision-makers at the networks.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the first recommendation of this report is a call for advocacy that promotes, encourages, or somehow actually leads to positive change. Such an advocacy role certainly should be on the agenda of the NAHJ leadership and should also be embraced by other national Latino and non-Latino organizations. It is far beyond time that the networks not only acknowledge their coverage patterns but also and most importantly develop internal assessments and training programs [that] will produce more inclusive, reliable and balanced news about Latinos and Latino issues. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCCNMA: Latino Journalists of California: CCNMA NAHJ MOU Timeline and Corrections on NAHJ claims\n\nNational Association of Hispanic Journalists: NAHJ and Latino Media, Communication Scholar Brings Back Study of Analysis of Coverage on Latino and Latino Issues\n\nStephanie Tsoflias Siegel, TV Spy: Annual Journalism Conference Overshadowed by Hurricane Irma\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric Bolling Out, Charles Payne Back at Fox\n\n\u201cSexual harassment investigations at Fox News had on-air hosts coming and going on Friday,\u201d Stephen Battaglio reported Friday for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe network has cut loose Eric Bolling, who was suspended on Aug. 5, and has also canceled his daily program \u2018Fox News Specialists.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, investigated allegations that Bolling used his cellphone to send unsolicited photos of male genitalia to current and former female colleagues at the network.

The Times was making a big push around diversity as I was leaving, and still is now. But one question that a lot of Asian-Americans at The Times had was, \u201cAre Asian-Americans part of that diversity push?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were doing better, in terms of number of reporters and editors, than African-Americans and Latinos, specifically. But the biggest beats at the newspaper are overwhelmingly white: Covering the presidential campaign, the White House, Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I was on Capitol Hill, I was one of the only Asian-Americans in that place. When I was on presidential buses and planes, there weren\u2019t very many Asian-Americans. One of the things we were trying to make sure of at The Times was that Asian-American representation was still an important concern.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s how it permeates into coverage as well? Not being counted?\u201d Uberti asked Luo in the Aug. 31 interview.\n\n\u201cThe thing with Asian-Americans is this sense of being the other \u2014 not quite feeling like we belong. That\u2019s very real. Jay Caspian Kang had this great piece in The Times magazine about a hazing death at an Asian-American fraternity. He wrote about how being Asian-American is a bit of an artificial construct \u2014 that different people within that category often have very little in common, other than a shared experience of discrimination. It\u2019s obviously a different kind of discrimination than what African-Americans or Latinos have experienced, but it\u2019s definitely there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI moved a bunch of times as a kid, but I always lived in these mostly white suburban areas. And even though I was captain of the soccer team or had a lot of friends, that lingering sense of otherness was always there. That\u2019s a social feeling.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started in a newsroom, I was part of this minority training program at The Los Angeles Times. And a big thing they taught us was that the work is important, but so is how you navigate the newsroom. It\u2019s like any other social ecosystem. There is an in-crowd. And there has always been, for me at least, this nagging sense that, as an Asian-American, there\u2019s just additional hoops you have to jump through. I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But it makes a difference when you\u2019re building relationships and trying to navigate an organization. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorials Debate Statues of Rizzo, Foster, Columbus\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Dallas City Council for its brave and historic decision to finally remove Confederate memorials from this city,\u201d the Dallas Morning News editorialized Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt was important for city leaders to make a strong statement that these tributes to our country\u2019s racist past no longer belong in our public spaces.

All of the plaintiffs are represented by the National Writers Union.\n\nThe lawsuit says that the freelancers worked for both Ebony and its sister publication, Jet magazine, but the publisher of both magazines \u201cfailed and/or refused\u201d to pay the amounts due for their work.\n\nJoshua File, a Chicago-based attorney who is representing the freelancers, told the Tribune that each of the freelancers was owed anywhere from a couple of hundred to several thousand dollars. The final tally will be determined in court.\n\n\u201cThey had contracts to provide content or services, did that, and weren\u2019t paid,\u201d File said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news of Ebony not paying its writers was broken in April by writer Jagger Blaec, who wrote about it and told her story in The Establishment and later expanded upon it on The Root. More writers came forward to tell their stories using the hashtag #EbonyOwes on Twitter.\n\nAs the hashtag gained momentum, Ebony issued the following statement addressing the issue:\n\nEbony magazine values the work of our freelancers and writers. We understand their concerns and we know that their unique talent and dedication to telling our stories have been an integral part of our success. As a part of our strategic growth plan, EBONY Media is working diligently to streamline and improve efficiencies throughout our operations and we will honor our commitment to our partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in early May, the magazine announced that it was laying off a third of its staff, shutting down its Chicago headquarters and consolidating editorial operations with Jet in Los Angeles. At that time, word spread of subscription holders saying that they had not received print copies of the magazine in the mail since November, although the magazine continued to appear on newsstands.\n\nMichael Gibson, co-founder and chairman of CVG Group, blamed the subscription delivery delays on a change in printers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, freelancers remained unpaid.\n\nThe #EbonyOwes hashtag continued to grow, and in late May, writers began reporting that Ebony was blocking them on Twitter for discussing the payment problems or asking about being paid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June, the National Writers Union stepped in on behalf of the freelancers and demanded that Ebony pay up.\n\nOn June 3, Ebony promised to have the payment issue resolved within 30 days.

A few hours later, Harmon walked into a nearby church bloodied, bruised and discombobulated, wearing nothing but her underwear.\n\nAccording to the Herald-Democrat, Harmon told the police that she was kidnapped by three black males wearing ski masks and gloves. Harmon explained how the roving band of masked thugs, obviously roaming the area looking for white women to defile, snatched the 18-year-old out of her car, took her to a wooded area and gang-raped her.\n\nBut Harmon bravely fended off the imaginary Negroes in an epic knife fight from which she luckily escaped with only a few scratches on her legs. She fled to the church and recounted her story to officers, who began searching for the African rape squad before they could attack another white woman.\n\nThe alleged rape of an innocent white girl angered people in the community and around the country. Everyone began searching for the evil men who stole Harmon\u2019s purity after her mom made a Facebook post:\n\nThis is going to be a brutally honest post. Today my daughter, Breana Harmon Talbott was taken by force by 3 black men. 2 raped her and she is cut head to toe by a knife. They took her engagement ring, her class ring, her earrings, her baby T necklace, everything she had on. She was able to run and ran into a church, bleeding from head to toe with no pants on. Someone had to have saw something!!! This town is small, if anyone, anyone hears ANYTHING, please call the denison police department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though no one claims to \u201chave saw something,\u201d the alt-right began explaining how they had been warning the world all along about how black men, unable to control their animalistic lust for legal-envelope-shaped Caucasian cakes, often satisfied their savage urges by raping white girls.\n\nSome folks brainstormed solutions for this raging epidemic, posting, \u201cWhites need a mafia \u2026 so if you want to rape a white girl like Breana Talbott the white mafia finds you and your family and puts you down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs police investigated, they wondered why Harmon\u2019s bruises were not consistent with being in a violent knife attack. Even more curiously, a nurse who examined Harmon said that there was no physical evidence of sexual assault, and did not think that she had been assaulted.\n\nAfter police questioned black men in the area and were unable to find the three-man white-girl rape team, Harmon eventually confessed that she might have made up the part about the black men. And the part about being kidnapped. And the part about being raped.\n\nHarmon admitted that she had cut herself and her jeans because she was upset about possibly breaking up with her boyfriend. When she realized that her mom might be upset about the jeans, Harmon said, she just made up the stuff about the group of masked rapists because ... well ... you know\u2014they\u2019re black. I\u2019m sure everyone can understand that siccing the police on black men is less stressful than having Mommy yell for a few minutes about ripping a perfectly good pair of Old Navy dungarees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Harmon pleaded guilty to two third-degree felony counts of tampering with physical evidence, a third-degree felony count of tampering with a government record and a state-jail felony count of tampering with a government record. The charges meant that Harmon faced 30 years in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very remorseful for what she did and what she said, and that\u2019s why she decided to plead guilty,\u201d Harmon\u2019s attorney, Bob Jarvis, explained, noting that the plea deal means that Harmon will not serve a day behind bars. \u201cThe cap is either regular probation or deferred adjudication,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll be asking for deferred and they\u2019ll be asking for regular probation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Texas, deferred adjudication means that Harmon will enter a guilty plea, but it will not be listed as a conviction. Upon successful completion of a period of community supervision, the charges against Harmon will be technically dismissed. Furthermore, Harmon will be able to file for nondisclosure after her period of supervision that \u201cessentially seals the criminal record of the offense from private entities,\u201d legal advocate website Avvo states. \u201cThis keeps potential employers, apartment complexes, and many others from knowing about the offense.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding whether or not Harmon receives probation or deferred adjudication, her lawyer plans to present the extenuating circumstances of the case, including some of the things she was going through at the time.\n\nAs of the date of publication, The Root was unable to reach a representative from the mythical masked black rape clique running around Denison, Texas, searching for blondes to desecrate.

Kelly\u2019s alleged sex crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly \u201cwas on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon singing Christmas songs on Dec. 23 last year. It\u2019s been in full view of the world for 20 years. And yet Kelly has not suffered repercussions on his career. . . .\u201d\n\nLevin asked DeRogatis, \u201cHow much of that do you think is because, as opposed to the Bill Cosby case, there haven\u2019t been as many people who\u2019ve put their names to the accusation?\u201d\n\nDeRogatis replied, \u201cI think the biggest factor is one that the African-American scholar Mark Anthony Neal has said: These are all young African-American women, and I think if there had been a white girl it would have been different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLevin, Slate\u2019s editorial director, introduced his interview this way:\n\n\u201cOn Dec. 21, 2000, Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that \u2018R. Kelly used his position of fame and influence as a pop superstar to meet girls as young as 15 and have sex with them, according to court records and interviews.\u2019\n\n\u201cTwo years later, DeRogatis was mailed a videotape that showed a man who looked like Kelly engaging in a sex act with what appeared to be an underage girl. That tape would be at the center of a 2008 criminal trial in which the singer was ultimately found not guilty of producing child pornography. Kelly was acquitted in that case after the judge did not allow jurors to hear evidence \u2014 much of which had been dug up by DeRogatis\u2014 that Kelly habitually had sex with underage girls, that he\u2019d paid settlements to several of those girls, and that he\u2019d married R&B star Aaliyah when she was 15 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Monday, nearly 17 years after he first reported on Kelly\u2019s alleged sex crimes, DeRogatis published an article for BuzzFeed surfacing allegations that the Trapped in the Closet auteur lured multiple young women into abusive, controlling sexual relationships.\n\n\u201cThe story focuses primarily on two aspiring musicians from Georgia and Florida \u2014 women DeRogatis does not name to protect their privacy \u2014 both of whom have cut off contact with their parents. Three women he does name, \u2018former members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle,\u2019 told DeRogatis that \u2018six women live in properties rented by Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs, and he controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe sexual relationships described in the BuzzFeed piece involve women who are above the age of consent. The story also notes that law enforcement officials from several jurisdictions have looked into the relationships and have not brought any charges. In a statement provided to BuzzFeed, Kelly\u2019s lawyer Linda Mensch wrote:\n\n\u201c \u2018We can only wonder why folks would persist in defaming a great artist who loves his fans, works 24/7, and takes care of all of the people in his life. He works hard to become the best person and artist he can be. It is interesting that stories and tales debunked many years ago turn up when his goal is to stop the violence; put down the guns; and embrace peace and love. I suppose that is the price of fame.

They felt they didn\u2019t need a columnist.\u201d\n\nJohn Drescher, executive editor of the N&O, did not respond to a request for comment. But he was effusive in the N&O story about Saunders\u2019 departure.\n\n\u201cFor more than two decades, Barry Saunders has been one of the Triangle\u2019s leading voices,\u201d Drescher was quoted as saying. \u201cHe\u2019s been courageous, he\u2019s been insightful, he\u2019s been funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBarry\u2019s deep roots in North Carolina clearly influenced his work and helped make him a must-read for many of our readers.\u201d\n\nThe story went on to quote former North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, noting that Saunders often used \u201clingo and down-home country talk\u201d that instantly appealed to readers, who would then discover greater truths in his work.\n\n\u201cWe found in Barry a man who has wisdom beyond what we initially expected,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cFrom my special perch, I can tell you that ... his columns helped make North Carolina be a better place.\u201d Also praising Saunders in the story was Durham Mayor Bill Bell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story also noted that \u201cFor several years at the newspaper, Saunders agreed to make himself look silly if readers gave enough money to an N&O holiday charity effort. . . .\u201d\n\nSaunders, 59, told Journal-isms that \u201cI can\u2019t complain at all. I had 24 great years at the N&O,\u201d and before that, three years at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and six-and-a-half years at the Post-Tribune in Gary, Ind.\n\n\u201cIf I were in politics, this is the point where I would say I\u2019m returning to spend more time with my family,\u201d Saunders joked. He added, \u201cI think journalism is something I still want to do,\u201d but that \u201cI can\u2019t really think of any other paper I\u2019d want to write for.\u201dThe N&O wrote of Saunders, \u201cSome of his most memorable columns poignantly showed how Triangle people responded to damaging hurricanes in North Carolina or deadly mass shootings in Orlando or Newtown. He often did obituaries when local people passed away, from a beloved bookstore owner to a judge whose harsh brand of justice Saunders said would not necessarily be missed. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of those who passed on was Chuck Stone, founding president of the National Association of Black Journalists and legendary columnist turned distinguished professor, who died in 2014.\n\nSaunders wrote tributes for the N&O and for Journal-isms and spoke at the service.\n\n\u201cEver heard the adage, \u2018You should never meet your heroes\u2019?\u201d Saunders wrote on April 7, 2014, for the N&O.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s presumably because you\u2019ll certainly be disappointed when he or she doesn\u2019t live up to your exalted opinion.\n\n\u201cBull. I met my hero, and it couldn\u2019t have turned out better.\n\n\u201cChuck Stone is, quite simply, the reason I\u2019m a columnist today.

Please pardon this electronic impersonality, but I am currently in absentia. \u2026 \u2018\n\n\u201cTrying to be like Chuck. . . .\u201d\n\nSaunders concluded his remembrance for Journal-isms with this: \u201cI had the honor of speaking about the man I consider my mentor, and related the most important advice Chuck ever gave me. Once, after thinking I\u2019d missed the mark on a column and seeing the News & Observer besieged by calls for my scalp, I called Chuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat should I do?

It\u2019s happening at a geometrically increased pace every day. . . . \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKawakami confirmed Thursday that he has hired Marcus Thompson, a black journalist who is sports columnist for the Bay Area News Group and author of \u201cGolden: the Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry,\u201d as a columnist.\n\nKawakami also said, \u201cThe Athletic guys are obviously based in San Francisco. We met in November for the first time. They\u2019re the smartest guys I\u2019ve talked to who are interested in this business, who are interested in staying in this business and interested in changing this business. The first time they bring out \u2018subscriber model,\u2019 obviously any newspaper guy is going to be a little leery of that. No matter what, even if we\u2019re incredibly successful right away, there\u2019s going to be a dramatic lessening of readership.

We\u2019ve got racists preaching from pulpits, writing laws and driving buses, too. . . .\u201d\n\nThe editorial was prompted by a report this week from City Inspector General Joe Ferguson detailing how one supervisor \u201cbanged out racist emails the way nice people send out birthday wishes. In one email about Chicago\u2019s high murder rate, [district Superintendent Paul] Hansen joked about a fake \u2018Chicago Safari\u2019 package that would guarantee tourists \u2018at least one kill and five crime scenes\u2019 and views of \u2018lots of animals in their natural habitat.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe editorial also noted, \u201cthe Chicago Tribune published a deeply detailed series of reports last month that showed how the assessor\u2019s office uses a mishmash of formulas to overvalue low-priced homes while undervaluing high-priced ones. The pattern hits minority communities particularly hard. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt concluded, \u201cWhen you get down to it, baked-in institutional racism is more repulsive than some throwback bigot in the Water Department.\u201d\n\nReporting Finds Lead Still Contaminates Urban Soil\n\n\u201cChildhood lead poisoning dramatically decreased across America as the federal government began phasing out leaded gasoline in the 1970s,\u201d concluded a five-part series published July 12 by ThinkProgress, reported by Yvette Cabrera. \u201cBut many children are still being exposed today because of lead\u2019s legacy: polluted environments, particularly in urban areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow we know that even low concentrations of lead in children are dangerous to their health and well-being. Yet federal, state and local policies have failed to keep up with scientific research and do not protect children from lead\u2019s irreversible consequences. . . .\u201d\n\nThe series concluded, \u201cThinkProgress tested more than 1,000 soil samples in homes and public spaces throughout Santa Ana, Ca. Nearly a quarter of the samples surpassed the hazardous level of 80 ppm set by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\n\n\u201c. . . Research shows that children who have blood lead levels below 5 mcg/dL can experience serious consequences such as cognitive deficits, behavioral issues, and educational delays, but those children often don\u2019t show acute physical symptoms of lead poisoning. Studies have also found that children with low to moderate blood lead levels experience the most IQ point loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA recent Public Health Institute study found that California and many other states across the country are severely undercounting and underreporting the number of lead-burdened children.

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States?

While this might sound banal, it\u2019s a clear instruction to states from the federal government to start purging the voting rolls. . . .\n\n\u201c3. The White House commission on election integrity, led by vice chair Kris Kobach, also sent a letter to 50 states asking them to provide sweeping voter data . . .\n\n\u201c4.

Under its provisions, Cuban authorities can detain someone for up for four years based on a belief that he or she is likely to commit a crime in the future. The law has been used repeatedly to jail critical reporters. Police can even issue a warning, alerting a suspect that he or she is in danger of becoming dangerous.

During a speech Thursday at a sheriffs\u2019 convention in Washington, D.C., Sessions found a way to bring up criminal records and gang violence while addressing Wednesday\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think effective enforcement of our gun laws, focusing on criminals and dangerous people, mentally ill people that have been\u2014where we have the legal ability to do so\u2014can reduce violence in our communities and improve public safety,\u201d Sessions said, ThinkProgress reports. \u201cIt is not good if we got gun laws that say criminals can\u2019t carry guns and they never get enforced. So we intend to enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone might want to let Sessions know that Nikolas Cruz, the accused gunman in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting, purchased his gun legally, which proves that current gun laws might be ineffective.\n\nBut Sessions wouldn\u2019t be Sessions if he didn\u2019t find a way to bring up gang violence\u2014which, unless Sessions is talking about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gang, which Cruz appeared to belong to, really has no place in this discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen parents once again go to sleep fearful that their kids will not be safe, even when they go to school\u2014parents have told me in gang-infested neighborhoods that children can no longer stand at the bus stop by themselves\u2014they take turns, parents do, of being out there every morning and afternoon,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve gotta confront the problem. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter to Sessions that Parkland is not a place terrorized by gang violence. Or that Parkland was just named Florida\u2019s safest city in 2017, according to an analysis by the Washington-based National Council for Home Safety and Security.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for the Trump administration to call homegrown terrorism by its name. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["violence", "racist", "parkland", "gang", "nonsensical", "way", "shooting", "know", "sessions", "gun", "speech", "symphony", "florida", "jeff", "laws", "think", "whistles", "school"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["violence", "president", "sarah", "white", "victims", "sanders", "tweets", "domestic", "allegations", "huckabee", "sexual", "house", "say", "statements", "supports", "trump"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

(It would be like the New York Times giving up \u2018All the News That\u2019s Fit to Print.\u2019) Ailes invented the slogan when he launched the network in 1996, and over the years it became a quasi-religious doctrine among Fox\u2019s anchors and viewers. The effectiveness of Fox News as a vehicle for conservative ideology depended on it. \u2018If you come out and you try to do right-wing news, you\u2019re gonna die.

The way that the right-wing network covered the deaths of police officers in 2014 is a case in point.\n\n\u201c \u2018The politicization surrounding the killing of two New York Police Department officers over the weekend was amazingly swift. Fox News led the right-wing media charge, immediately claiming Democratic elected officials were somehow responsible for the gun rampage\u2026 ,\u2019 the MediaMatters analysis observed.\n\n\u201c \u2018On Fox, hosts and guests were sure who was to blame for the tragedy; not the gunman necessarily, but political and community leaders like President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, Mayor Bill de Blasio and MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton. Why? Because the men, to varying degrees, have spoken out about the troubled relationship between law enforcement and the black community, and raised concerns about two recent high-profile cases, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, in which unarmed black men were killed, and police officers responsible were not indicted.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSherman also wrote, \u201cIn the annals of modern advertising, \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 will be considered a classic. The slogan was Ailes\u2019s cynical genius at its most successful.

Maynard, president of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, was seeking a counterpoint to the online media columns of the day, which did not sufficiently address diversity topics and news of journalists of color.\n\nThe column refocused to include Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans and was posted three times a week.

But a fair amount of it is wrong, coming from ideological, partisan or single-interest critics or sites that tell their readers or subscribers where to complain about what,\u201d added Getler, a former ombudsman for PBS and the Washington Post. \u201cThey have little interest in improving journalism but rather promote points of view or tear down news operations that threaten them with strong, fact-based reporting. So an ombudsman these days can also engage not just in internal critiques but in defending their news organisations against widespread but inaccurate criticism. . . .\u201d\n\nIn Boston, WGBH News, in collaboration with the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, launched \u201cLoving Day,\u201d a three-part commemoration series on interracial marriage that aired on 89.7 WGBH June 12-14.

This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7.

He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president.

Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4.

But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background.

For a freelancer to have to struggle to pay rent because Ebony owes is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nNWU represents freelance writers, and it stepped in on behalf of the Ebony freelancers when #EbonyOwes began trending on Twitter. Writer Jagger Blaec broke the story that got the hashtag started in April and discussed the issue on The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEbony was owned by Johnson Publishing, a family-owned business that also started sister magazine Jet. Johnson Publishing sold both magazines to Texas-based private equity CVG Group in May 2016.\n\nLast month, Ebony laid off nearly a third of its staff and made plans to consolidate editorial operations with Jet in Los Angeles.\n\nSo is Ebony robbing Peter to pay Paul?\n\nGoldbetter said that anonymous sources have told him that Ebony is far from cash-strapped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInteresting things happen when people organize and come together,\u201d Goldbetter said. \u201cPeople have contacted me to say that during the time Ebony Media owed these writers for their work, the company spent six figures on Super Bowl parties in Houston, the Ebony 100 event in Los Angeles and a pitch competition at SXSW. I was also told that money that was initially earmarked for freelancers was later allocated to other things. The money is clearly there. The commitment to paying freelancers is not.\u201d\n\nAccording to NWU, CVG tried to blame the payment issues on the previous owners, but Goldbetter disputes that.\n\n\u201cCVG acquired Ebony almost a year ago, and freelancers have gone uncompensated as recently as the latest issue. That\u2019s not a Johnson Publishing issue; that\u2019s a CVG issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which NWU belongs to, also had something to say on the issue.\n\nIn a tweet from its official account, the union organization said, \u201cThe bills don\u2019t pay themselves. #EbonyOwes its freelance writers for their work. Time to pay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one should have to chase after money that is owed to them, especially not people from whom you have solicited work that takes research and valuable time and effort. They deserve to be paid.\n\nYou can\u2019t be out here popping bottles and having a good time while those who have made it possible for you to do just that have to worry about whether they will be able to make all their bills or eat next month.\n\nWhat Ebony is doing is despicable, and it is even more upsetting coming from an iconic black publication that hired black writers, only to do them dirty in the end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou on the clock, Ebony.

One of Suckabee\u2019s few jobs is to translate for the devil, who, for years, has been losing some of his pigment, and instead of being red is just Cheetos-dust-colored.\n\n\n\nSo it makes sense that Suckabee is out here doing the non-Lord\u2019s work.

Excited at the opportunity \u2014 especially when I was invited to write again and again \u2014 I continued to accept assignments. The pay window was 45 days which meant I would complete and submit an article and get another story assignment several times before seeing payment. So having started in late September, I knew I wouldn\u2019t see payment until early December.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThen, with turnover in the accounts payable department, with the buyout and of course the holidays, I thought the lag was somewhat understandable, though very inconvenient.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the year, I started following up twice monthly about payment and by March I told my editor I could no longer accept assignments until I received payment for nine stories I\u2019d written for online and magazine publication.\u201d At the start of the Twitter storm and #EbonyOwes, I received payment for under half of what was due me.

Nineteen women have come out to claim that before the president became the president, he was sexually inappropriate. The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father. So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m unclear how Ivanka Trump believes that the question was inappropriate.

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

The comment came after the president criticized armed officers who didn\u2019t run into the school after hearing the commotion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The president is a gilded-chair quarterback.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly.

I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen.

In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

As a part of our strategic growth plan, EBONY Media is working diligently to streamline and improve efficiencies throughout our operations and we will honor our commitment to our partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Ebony\u2014we don\u2019t believe you; you need more people.\n\nHere is the thing: \u201cEbony\u201d is just a name on a piece of paper. It is the writers who contribute and share their stories who make it what it is. Without them, Ebony is nothing but old memories and ads for Murray\u2019s Pomade. The people who spill their pens, brains and blood onto the pages are the most important obligation any publication has. They should be paid even before Ebony cuts a check to the electric company, because it is the writers who pay all bills (along with Murray\u2019s Pomade, but still ... ).\n\nIn full disclosure, I am one of the people who have been stiffed by Ebony. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cBut you\u2019ve been working at The Root for months.\u201d Exactly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve contacted the company regularly for payment for articles that date back to August 2016, only to be repeatedly told some version of \u201cWe got you.\u201d After I eventually concluded that they just weren\u2019t going to pay me, I had the same internal conflict that Ijeoma Oluo and others voiced: Do I say something and have other editors and publications give me a permanent side eye, or do I chalk it up to the game? (I never knew what that meant. Is there a game where people don\u2019t get their points or money? Are they referring to the \u201cdope game\u201d? I\u2019m not an expert, but I\u2019m pretty sure drug dealers don\u2019t take kindly to nonpayment. Plus, they don\u2019t typically have a lot of chalk ... but like I said, I\u2019m not an expert.)\n\nThere is another side to the story. For many people\u2014especially black writers\u2014Ebony magazine is like family. It sat on our grandmothers\u2019 coffee tables. We flipped through its pages waiting for haircuts. Malcolm X was in it. Muhammad Ali was on the cover. Billy Dee Williams was in it (because Murray\u2019s Pomade had his hair looking ... you get what I\u2019m saying). Airing it out publicly felt like putting family business in the street. When your aunt Gladys owes you money, you don\u2019t go tell the world.\n\nBut it turns out that Ebony isn\u2019t our auntie. It\u2019s just a remnant of something we remember fondly. If I start calling myself Beyonc\u00e9, it doesn\u2019t mean I can automatically sing and dance. The Ebony of Martin Luther King Jr. owes me nothing because it\u2019s gone.

In response to that article, several black journalists have come forward to share their stories about waiting for payment.\n\nSifting through the #EbonyOwes hashtag on Twitter, I came across famed TV critic Eric Deggans at NPR, who wrote about his own experience with the publication.\n\nDeggans, who is also author of the book Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation, tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t know about the race angle [in the article\u2019s title], but I know about Ebony failing to pay writers. The magazine owes me $1,200.\u201d\n\nAfter I reached out to Deggans, he elaborated: \u201cI wrote a feature story on Obama as a pop-culture president for its special edition on the outgoing president. I sent my first invoice for the $1,200 fee Oct. 31.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis feature has already been published in the print publication of Ebony. True to this pattern, there is no differentiation between whether the work is unpaid print or digital work. He went on: \u201cSo far I\u2019ve gotten no payment, despite repeated inquiries to the editor-in-chief and their accounts payable email.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what accounts payable had to say, he simply stated that there had been \u201cno response.\u201d\n\nEbony magazine had a very public buyout by private-equity firm Clear View Group LLC last year in June 2016. According to Ebony, the group took over Ebony magazine, ebony.com and jetmag.com. The firm was founded by Michael Gibson and Willard Jackson in 2015 to specialize in private-equity acquisitions. There had always been whispers of late payment, even before the buyout, but according to sources, things seem to have gotten worse since Clear View came into the picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I attempted to contact Ebony magazine\u2019s editors, I was met with radio silence. Then I reached out to Jackson, listed at LinkedIn as the co-founder and vice chairman of Clear View, on Facebook to give him and Clear View a chance to explain the issues around payment.\n\nThere was no comment until after The Establishment article went live.\n\nIn a text message exchange, Jackson replied, \u201cLove to chat. I hear you are one of those reporters that like to tear down black businesses.\u201d When asked if there were any plans to recoup the missing funds for all of the freelancers affected by these delayed payments, Jackson claimed to have no knowledge of unpaid compensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMissing funds? Exploited? Of course they are all getting paid. We bought the business to turn around all this stuff,\u201d he messaged.\n\nBut other freelancers confided that they have yet to receive payment for work that had been invoiced in 2016.\n\nAccording to a copy of the contract that Ebony issues writers, each individual party signed an agreement that states that the \u201cPublisher will pay writer $X if Publisher accepts the manuscript of the Work or 45 days from the date of receipt by Publisher of writer\u2019s invoice, whichever is later.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple sources say that so much of this fight for payment seems to be out of the hands of their editors and outsourced to the financial group that purchased Ebony.\n\n\u201cSome editors have complained on our behalf, and it\u2019s frustrating because it makes them look bad, too. But it\u2019s the accounts payable and the higher-ups who are not signing off on our approved invoices,\u201d said an anonymous source.\n\nAs freelancers continue to wait for Clear View to \u201cturn around all this stuff,\u201d Zerline Hughes also expressed frustration on Twitter using #EbonyOwes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s #NationalVolunteerWeek but I\u2019m no @EbonyMag volunteer,\u201d she said. Hughes explained that she has written for the print magazine and is owed around $2,950. She received notification that her check was \u201cin the mail,\u201d but this information coincidentally came at a time when Hughes had been tweeting about the delinquent payments and had been unable to get anywhere with accounts payable.\n\nThrough private conversations, it has been established that the cumulative amount of money Ebony owes its freelancers so far exceeds $15,000 and counting. The only way to guarantee recovery of these lost wages is to keep speaking up. And sometimes that means through social media.\n\nWhile hundreds of freelancers have taken to Twitter using the hashtag #EbonyOwes to show solidarity, many freelancers are exhausted from chasing paper. One writer, Mikki Kendall, tweeted that she was also a victim of Ebony\u2019s refusal to pay: \u201cI just stopped writing for them & I have been less & less willing to do think pieces because to be honest I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued, \u201cAnd it is literally not just Ebony.

Her job as a mouthpiece for the NRA is to shift the focus from looking at gun laws to looking at anything but gun laws.\n\nSeriously, she doesn\u2019t care if the focus goes from the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to the county sheriff\u2019s department, which she tried to accomplish during a CNN town hall. She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well. Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep.

When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media.

To serve one\u2019s God is a mighty purpose. It requires selflessness and compassion.\n\n\n\nSo it is with all due respect that I ask, what the fuck happened to Mark Burns? I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling. To date, Burns has some 87,300 followers on Twitter and an additional 4,500 on Instagram. Not to mention, he pastors a church, which means he\u2019s preaching his love of Trump and all things Trumpian to rooms full of black people. And. They. Are. Listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to two points: 1) We cannot dismiss Burns, and 2) What the fuck happened to him? Like, what level of self-hatred must you endure to fall this far? He\u2019s 38 years old, which means that someone in his life had to love him enough to induce him to the revolutionary sounds of N.W.A. Where was he during the No Limit movement? Has he ever been \u201cBout It, Bout It\u201d?\n\nDid he not watch the Diff\u2019rent Strokes episode where Dudley was almost molested by the bicycle-store owner, but for a quick-thinking Arnold? That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K. Brown, to tweet this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat happened. And this man is ministering to other black people. He\u2019s widening his platform daily and is one of the few public black faces that are helping to grease the asses of other black folks so that Trump\u2019s foot can fit. I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["educators", "program", "forward", "especially", "schools", "teachers", "moving", "armed", "gun", "approved", "children", "florida", "black", "students", "laws", "legislature", "dangerous", "school"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

But because this administration\u2019s motto is \u201c(Lie) faster, (cheat) higher, (bullshit) stronger,\u201d Sanders also added in a three-minute-long word problem and her best Mariah Carey impersonation.\n\nSanders wore Pepto Bismol pink to lie-apalooza the press conference, maybe because all the lies she was about to spew forth on the taxpayer dime were giving her a bad case of the bubble guts.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\nLOL, Sarah, Quit Playing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders, who shares genes with a man who easily cracks the top three least-funny men on the planet, opted to begin the briefing with a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic I know all of you are preparing to ask me about,\u201d Sanders said to a room full of stressed-out political reporters who did not have time for this. \u201cTax reform.\u201d\n\nOhohohohoh Sarah!

To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part. Watch as she proverbially clutches her faux pearls in faux-righteous anger and asks, But why aren\u2019t we talking about Hillary, though?\n\n\u201cThe real collusion scandal, as we\u2019ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,\u201d Sanders said, evoking notable criminal investigator O.J. Simpson (emphasis mine).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence [the election],\u201d Sanders continued.\n\n\n\nHuh.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms?

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["white", "racist", "know", "im", "plan", "stuff", "gun", "right", "donald", "crime", "solved", "lives", "black", "trump", "matter", "nra", "think"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

These people and several hundred others were allegedly shot by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as he took position on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and fired thousands of rounds down on concertgoers during a Jason Aldean show.\n\n\n\nToday, as well as in the coming days and weeks, the conversation will turn to the role that the availability of high-powered weapons has on America\u2019s unique predilection for mass shootings. Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle. There have been and will continue to be very passionate rebukes of Sanders and Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association and white maleness, and very smart people will offer possible solutions to this unsolvable problem.\n\nAnd then, when another mass shooting happens next month or next year or tomorrow in Austin, Texas, or Youngstown, Ohio, or Durham, N.C., or Denver, the same thing will happen again. Nothing will change.\n\nIt\u2019s with this context that I\u2019m left to wonder exactly how many white people would have to die in a mass shooting before America\u2019s collective will to stop this from happening again would surpass its zeal and yearning for guns. Which number would serve as the critical mass?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know, after Sandy Hook, that the deaths of 20 young schoolchildren weren\u2019t enough.

It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control. If there are roughly 40 million black people here, then roughly 40 million black people would have to die. Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist. No need for night-lights if all the bogeymen are dead.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, what is the number? 250? 500? 600? 1,300? 2,200? 57,000?

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta.

Not President Donald Trump, though; he\u2019s out stunting, bashing the armed school security officer for not running into the school to save the kids, and of course, making everything about himself.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I\u2019d run in there, even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,\u201d Trump told a gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a test; you don\u2019t even have to pull out a pen and paper\u2014Trump would fail, miserably. This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["president", "likely", "bunch", "shooter", "save", "kids", "hes", "presidents", "trump", "afraid", "run", "school"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

She has acknowledged that her tweets crossed that line and has apologized for doing so. We accept her apology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contrition followed 48 hours in which White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the \u201cSportsCenter\u201d co-host should be fired, the National Association of Black Journalists stood by Hill\u2019s free-speech rights, and others debated the role of ESPN in the media universe, Trump\u2019s stance toward African Americans, particularly black women, the meaning of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and how the reaction to Hill compared with that accorded others who made controversial statements.\n\nAs reproduced Wednesday by David Mack of BuzzFeed, Hill\u2019s since-deleted Monday night tweets included, \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists\u201d and \u201cTrump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about that in the White House briefing room Wednesday, Sanders said, \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 comments were immediately denounced by journalists, who said Sanders had crossed a line. The White House publicly calling for the firing of a private citizen for expressing her views? Other presidents have complained about reporters in private, but not at a news conference.\n\nIt became yet another threshold crossed by the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Pete Vernon wrote Thursday in his Columbia Journalism Review newsletter, \u201cThough questions about what journalists can and should say on their personal social media feeds didn\u2019t begin with Trump, his rise \u2014 and the politicization of nearly all aspects of American culture \u2014 have forced the issue. Politico\u2019s managing editor recently waded into this larger controversy when he told staffers that the company discards \u2018dozens\u2019 of job applications over inappropriate or partisan tweets.\n\nVernon added, \u201cHill is hardly the first media figure to associate Trump with white supremacy. Last month, both The New Yorker and The Economist featured covers depicting the president and the white hood of the Ku Klux Klan. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that Trump\u2019s \u2018ideology is white supremacy\u2019 in last week\u2019s widely read Atlantic story.\n\n\u201cSo why did Hill\u2019s comments become an issue worthy of an official response from the lectern? In part, because conservative media figures like sentient hot-take Clay Travis and perpetually confused Tucker Carlson made it one. Some journalists suggested Sanders\u2019s response was a deliberate attempt by the administration to distract from bigger issues. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Hill is a black woman did not escape Brittney Cooper, associate professor of women\u2019s and gender studies and Africana Studies at Rutgers University. Cooper noted on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In With Chris Hayes\u201d Wednesday that the Trump White House has also disparaged reporter April Ryan and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., other black women.\n\nHas Trump embraced white supremacy? \u201cThere is something Donald Trump did to get into office that we haven\u2019t seen in 150 years,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhere did she lie?\u201d Jason Johnson, theRoot.com\u2019s political editor who joined Cooper in the segment, asked about Hill.\n\nThe accuracy of Hill\u2019s statements and the fear that racism is being even more normalized were enough for many African Americans to support Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur society abounds with white people who are more likely to be disturbed at being called racist than they are to be disturbed by racism,\u201d Jarvis DeBerry wrote for NOLA.com | the Times-Picayune. \u201cConsequently, people will condemn Hill without even pausing to consider the accuracy of her allegation.\u201d\n\nMoreover, some don\u2019t view the meaning of the words \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d as static. Washington journalist John McQuaid argued on Facebook that \u201cThe commonly-accepted meaning used to refer to people espousing an explicit \u2018whites are superior\u2019 ideology \u2013David Duke, et al. But thanks in part to Ta-Nehisi Coates, a broader definition has gained currency \u2013 the structure of white privilege embedded (often non-explicitly or unconsciously) in institutions and attitudes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Trump promoting this type of white supremacy? Arguably, yes. But the term is still charged and many/most white people (in particular) are going to equate it saying \u2018you are another David Duke.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndy Borowitz, satirist for the New Yorker magazine, said Trump wouldn\u2019t qualify in any case. \u201cUpbraiding the ESPN anchor Jemele Hill for calling Donald Trump a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday that \u201cno one has done more than President Trump to prove that white people are not superior,\u2019 \u201d Borowitz wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Hill\u2019s tweets were red meat for right-wingers who love to hate on ESPN \u2014 and Hill.\n\nOn blacksportsonline.com Tuesday, Robert Littal compiled \u201cA Collection of Tweets Just From Today of Trump Supporters Calling Jemele Hill a Nigger.\u201d\n\nHill is a former columnist at the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cSportsCenter\u201d is an opinion show. In the debate over Hill\u2019s tweets, some confused the obligations of straight-news reporters with those of commentators, even though they correctly noted that comments on social media and on the air might be subject to different standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Draper wrote Wednesday in the New York Times, \u201cThe network has reoriented its programming more toward opinion and debate, encouraging some hosts to veer away from sports. Hill\u2019s \u2018SportsCenter\u2019 often mixes sports with social and cultural topics. Hill, who is black, and her co-host, Michael Smith, who is also black, frequently discuss black culture \u2014 uncommon for an ESPN show.\n\n\u201cESPN is hardly without conservative representation. Hill\u2019s tweets were posted about an hour before the second broadcast of ESPN\u2019s \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 doubleheader. The analyst for that game was Rex Ryan, who introduced President Trump at a rally last year. The show\u2019s anthem was sung by Hank Williams Jr., a conservative who was once dropped by ESPN for comparing President Obama to Hitler. . . .\u201dESPN\u2019s mixing of sports and politics is not going to change anytime soon, Jim Brady, ESPN\u2019s public editor, wrote in April.\n\n\u201cThere is no denying that culture, sports and politics are fused together more today than at any time in recent memory, and there\u2019s an argument to be made that ESPN is rightfully taking advantage of that trend. But there\u2019s also no denying the presence of a fervent fan base that prefers the ESPN of old, meaning these worlds will continue to collide,\u201d Brady wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear: Those of you who have not held your tongue about ESPN\u2019s move away from an all-sports-all-the-time mantra also should not hold your breath waiting for a change.\n\n\u201cESPN has made it clear: It\u2019s not sticking to sports.\u201d\n\nAaron Blake, Washington Post: White House says Jemele Hill calling Trump a racist is a \u2018fireable offense.\u2019 Trump once called Obama a racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Brady, ESPN: New ESPN guidelines recognize connection between sports, politics (April 4)\n\nPhilip Bump, Washington Post: Trump\u2019s press secretary offers suggested punishments for two Trump critics\n\nBryan Curtis, theringer.com: Deep Six: Jemele Hill and the Fight for the Future of ESPN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry: NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill was spot-on when she called Donald Trump a white supremacist\n\nRichard Deitsch, Sports Illustrated: ESPN Employees Respond to Jemele Hill Controversy over Trump Comments\n\nKevin Draper, New York Times: Comments by Jemele Hill of ESPN a \u2018Fireable Offense,\u2019 White House Says\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Mack, BuzzFeed: The White House Says ESPN Should Fire Jemele Hill For Calling Trump An Ignorant White Supremacist\n\nNational Association of Black Journalists: Statement from the National Association of Black Journalists on Jemele Hill\n\nNicholas Parco, Daily News, New York: Colin Kaepernick shows support for Jemele Hill and her tweet calling President Trump a \u2018white supremacist\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarron J.

The selflessness and deference to the man of the hour, they said, was the power of Vance.\n\n\u201cEvery single one had something to share about their love for this guy,\u201d said Harris, a recent arrival at Vance\u2019s shop from rival WJLA-TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt says so much about this guy. I\u2019m now shaking in my shoes, \u2018cause I realize what this man meant to this town. It\u2019s humbling to walk down the same hallways.\u201d And Vance did it \u201cjust by being himself,\u201d Harris said.\n\nEight hundred people were at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral Tuesday morning for an invitation-only memorial service for Vance, which was televised on NBC\u2019s owned-and-operated WRC-TV.\n\nVance had become such a local icon that in June his image was unveiled on the outdoor wall of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, a favorite tourist spot. He spent 48 years at WRC before succumbing to lung cancer July 22 at age 75.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe two-hour service at Washington National Cathedral was as close to a party as you could have in such grandiose surroundings,\u201d Roxanne Roberts wrote Tuesday in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere was lots of music, laughter and a guest list of Washington\u2019s broadcasting and political elite: the entire Channel 4 family, of course, plus Gordon Peterson, Paul Berry, Arch Campbell, Chris Matthews, Katie Couric, Willard Scott, Mayor Muriel Bowser, former attorney general Eric Holder and Redskins quarterback Sonny Jurgensen. . . .\u201d\n\nVance was proud of his Philadelphia roots even as he and the nation\u2019s capital embraced each other, but he had more than local significance. An inductee into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame, Vance became an example of the importance of local news anchors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything definitive recently that\u2019s been written about the importance of local anchors,\u201d Mike Cavender, then executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Association, told Journal-isms after Vance\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cNews research, generally, shows they are among the most trusted components of TV News in terms of trustworthiness and believability\u2026.and are a major reason why local TV news is among the most trusted news sources of them all in the United States. Jim Vance is certainly a classic example of that on so many levels\u2026and his tenure at WRC-TV is a major reason why that station for so long has been at the top of the ratings in DC.\u201d\n\nBowser told the crowd, Vance \u201cdidn\u2019t just deliver the news, he engaged in a conversation with us.\u201d His co-anchor Doreen Gentzler reminded the audience that for all Vance\u2019s comfort in his own skin and other personal attributes, he was a skilled reporter who could edit adeptly on the fly as the Teleprompter rolled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome said afterward that they were surprised that the service was \u201cunapologetically black,\u201d as NBC\u2019s Craig Melvin, the master of ceremonies, described Vance himself. That was no small feat in a town once known as \u201cChocolate City\u201d but where gentrification has eroded that sobriquet. A recent book has rechristened D.C. \u201cCappuccino City.\u201d Yet, as the Undefeated writer Mike Wise said of Vance when the service ended, \u201cHe was a hero to all of Washington.\u201d\n\nThe program featured several of Vance\u2019s red-coated Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers from Cheyney State College in the early 1960s. Led by Kenneth \u201cQP\u201d Hamilton, who first met Vance in 1960, they sang the Kappa anthem. They recalled that the late Ed Bradley, who went on to become the noted \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent, was Vance\u2019s roommate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Moonlighters, a doo-wop group all sporting royal blue ties and dark suits, underscored Vance\u2019s love of that genre \u2014 he and his Cheyney football teammates would sing on the bus ride home after inevitably losing away games. The Moonlighters\u2019 song of choice for this occasion was, \u201cYou Gave Me Peace of Mind.\u201d\n\nThe Howard University Gospel Choir represented the black religious tradition, singing \u201cGoin\u2019 Up Yonder\u201d early in the service.\n\nAnd in a voice reminiscent of Paul Robeson, one listener said, Pastor Wintley Phipps, an education activist and founder of the U.S. Dream Academy, which runs an after-school mentoring program, sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cheney alum Wendell Whitlock noted, Vance and his buddies could also sing challenging operatic passages.\n\nAs befit the occasion, the speakers told anecdotes. Melvin recalled that on arriving to town, Vance invited him to partake of the best steaks in Washington. The establishment turned out to be a strip club. \u201cHe wanted to see what kind of a guy I was,\u201d Melvin related. \u201cWould I freak out?\u201d Melvin said he didn\u2019t.\n\nLongtime radio and television host Donnie Simpson told of the friendship he and Vance developed, with Vance taking the younger man under his wing. At first Simpson was surprised to find that \u201ctheir anchor desk was as black as the Pittsburgh Steelers defensive line. So this is the Chocolate City I\u2019ve heard so much about?\u201d he mused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Vance never knew Simpson\u2019s father, when the anchor heard of his passing, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral, returning to D.C. in time for his 6 p.m. news broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s how you tell a brother you love him,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nLater, Simpson told of turning down a radio contract because \u201csometimes when you grab the money on the table, you leave your dignity on the floor.\u201d Vance signaled his approval during his newscast that night.\n\nJohnny Allen alluded to Vance\u2019s public battles with cocaine addiction, declaring, \u201cyou have to find joy in who you are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaya Angelou once said, \u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s stepson, Brendon Pinkard, echoed that. Of what he gleaned from anecdotes about his father, Pinkard said, what most came through was \u201chow he made them feel when they were around him. He made them feel as though they were the most important person in the room.\u201d\n\nHamilton, Vance\u2019s Kappa comrade, approved of the service. \u201cEven though he said he didn\u2019t want anything like this, he would have been pleased,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI know. I was his buddy. All he said was \u2018have a big party and drink some tequila.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN\u2019s Michael Wilbon, seated behind former attorney general Holder and his wife, Sharon Malone, also was pleased. \u201cIt was uplifting,\u201d Wilbon said after the service. \u201cI\u2019m not in awe of many people,\u201d as he is constantly around celebrities, Wilbon said, \u201cbut Vance is one.\u201d He cited the hometown hero\u2019s charisma and authenticity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have many heroes.

Broadening perspectives on race, class and gender is a much-needed challenge to traditional approaches that reinforce \u2018a monolithic point of view,\u2019 said Rhea Combs, curator of film and photography at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. . . .\u201d\n\nThe piece includes this passage about this column\u2019s perspective:\n\n\u201cThe desire to have their voices heard \u2014 and the issues that mattered covered \u2014 has long been of concern in the African-American community, said Richard Prince, the editor of Journal-isms, a website devoted to diversity in journalism. He dates it to the country\u2019s first black newspaper, Freedom\u2019s Journal, whose editors declared in 1827: \u2018We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile a similar impulse led to the creation of influential, black-owned newspapers like The Chicago Defender, it was not enough to influence mainstream media. Indeed, among the sobering findings of the Kerner Commission report after urban unrest in the 1960s was a call for more diversity in mainstream media. [PDF, go to Chapter 15]\n\n\u201c \u2018The industry began to stir itself out of complacency in 1978, when the American Society of News Editors started a staff census of newspapers around the country. When the group found that the percentage of minority journalists in American newsrooms was just 3.95 percent in 1978, it set an industry goal to match the percentage of journalists to the percentage of people of color in the general population by the year 2000.\n\n\u201cThe goal was not met, with the percentage of minorities in newsrooms hovering at between 12 to 17 percent for the last decade. Instead, 2025 was set as the new target. This does not surprise Mr. Prince, who had been an editor at The Washington Post. Despite improvements in some newsrooms during the 1980s and 1990s, progress has stalled as the industry faced economic and structural upheaval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The rise of the internet, and the precariousness of the financial condition of newspapers, caused a lot of the owners to forget all about diversity and say, \u201cWe have to worry about own bottom line and survival,\u201d not realizing that what also was happening at the same time were demographic changes in the population that made diversity even more important because the consumer base was changing,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a majority minority country by 2050, I believe.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn addition to bringing about a cultural shift within companies, there needs to be accountability, too. Mr. Prince echoed the sentiment of many when he said that hiring needs to reflect diversity goals, which may come only through the recognition of the power of one particular color: green. \u2018If you don\u2019t produce diversity among the section that you are responsible for, then your salary is affected,\u2019 Mr. Prince said. \u2018That gets people\u2019s attention.\u2019 . . . \u201c\n\nPablo Manriquez, HuffPost: Award-Winning Latina Photojournalist Chronicles Houston\u2019s Undocumented Hurricane Victims\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNina Garcia Named Editor of Elle Magazine\n\n\u201cNina Garcia will be the next editor of Elle magazine, Hearst announced Tuesday morning,\u201d Matthew Schneier reported Tuesday for the New York Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUntil now the creative director of Marie Claire magazine, Ms. Garcia has a name and a tart take on style known to millions in her capacity as a longtime judge on \u2018Project Runway.\u2019 She is also the author of four books on fashion.\n\n\u201c \u2018Look at the issue of empowerment around young working women and the obsession with fashion and beauty.

It\u2019s amazing how children can crystallize your beliefs. For years, I have had these conflicting emotions about how and why I cover football \u2014 particularly the NFL \u2014 but one little boy\u2019s comment cut through the mixed feelings.\n\n\u201c \u2018No,\u2019 I thought. \u2018Hell no.

If only it were that easy for the rest of us to transition from America\u2019s favorite troubled pastime.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t merely about the dangers of playing football. My son stirred some deeper thoughts. It\u2019s not that I hate the game; it\u2019s that my distrust of its stewards is at an all-time high, and the NFL leads the way with its clumsy, reckless and self-serving leadership. The problem isn\u2019t one thing. It\u2019s the whole buffet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dread the start of another NFL season. I dread it because obsession is about to drown out concern again. I dread that my work is about to help fuel this obsession. Every sport has issues, but the attention the NFL receives and the money it makes allow for blind arrogance to take over every fall and winter. The NFL has suffered some dings to its popularity, but the damage is minor thus far, barely noticeable, which means the league will go on abusing responsibility and creating an awful example for how to maintain the game.\n\n\u201cThe issues are vast and diverse. They include the NFL\u2019s ongoing failure to commit to a more responsible way to do objective research and protect its players from the effects of concussions and brain injuries caused by playing football. And the limited resources and lack of compassion given to retired athletes who wrecked their bodies to provide entertainment.\n\n\u201cAnd the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick and the overall NFL ambivalence toward its players\u2019 legitimate concerns about equality and social justice. And the confusing and contradictory way that the league disciplines its players, from Tom Brady to Ezekiel Elliott, which consistently shows that it is more concerned about perception than fairness or rehabilitation. And the culture of fighting the players over every dime, which leads to contentious contract negotiations even for stars such as Le\u2019Veon Bell and Aaron Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of these grievances fall under one huge, disheartening umbrella: The NFL doesn\u2019t respect humanity.

She\u2019s in the White House because her father wanted her there. She prides herself on being a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d who helps her father make difficult moral decisions. In fact, Ivanka Trump took her job as Trump whisperer so seriously, she took an official unpaid role in the White House just so she could do that.\n\nI think that these people\u2014and by \u201cthese people,\u201d I mean these Trumps\u2014don\u2019t understand the nature of this public position. You can\u2019t be Daddy\u2019s daughter when it suits you and right (unpaid) hand to the president when that\u2019s convenient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the interview with NBC News in South Korea, where Ivanka Trump crashed the Winter Olympics closing ceremony, NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander asked Trump, the mother of three young children, what she thought about the president\u2019s dumb-ass proposal to arm some teachers in school.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cObviously, there would have to be an incredibly high standard for who would be able to bear arms in our school. But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester. OK, I didn\u2019t go there, I mean, hell, I was smart enough to know not to go there, but I don\u2019t know how he makes this shit up! Also, did you know he has another daughter named Tiffany, but no one ever talks about her?! You, want to know why? Because I\u2019m the dominant Trump offspring! I\u2019m better than Fredo and Vampire Boy and Tiffany\u2014who? Exactly!\u201d\n\nBut that would\u2019ve required her to go against her father in public, which she\u2019d never do.", "keywords": ["president", "daughter", "ivanka", "19", "know", "assault", "father", "think", "idea", "women", "sexual", "trump", "fathers", "believe", "accusers"], "polarity": 0.1331153711484594, "subjectivity": 0.4824789915966387},

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["nra", "celebrate", "proposed", "weapons", "rick", "enforcement", "mental", "gun", "law", "florida", "gov", "health", "shouldnt", "scott", "trump", "yes", "ranks", "school"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

Well, Mona Scott-Young if Mona Scott-Young were a 71-year-old white man with the intellectual curiosity of Cujo (after Cujo was shot dead), and the emotional intelligence of a raging teenager who just gulped the last bottle of Four Loko in North America. Yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nThe longer this disaster of an administration goes on, the more it feels as if anyone who chooses to work at the White House faces risks more akin to a rookie reality-television personality than to any political appointee. Usually, a political staffer may be ousted, but at the very least, they can keep their dignity, marriages and spines intact as they go pimp the speaker and TV-pundit circuit. Not so much with Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, no. You enter this bitch, and chances are you will leave with irreparable damage to your reputation. Of course, it\u2019s unsurprising that a reality-TV-star candidate for president runs his White House as if it were a reality show. And considering that 45 cares only about Twitter, various strains of prejudice, golf and yelling at cable news, I imagine that the man would much rather pit his staff against one another and let chaos ensue than read his daily briefs.\n\n\n\nBut at least reality stars walk away from national embarrassment with a new stream of income by way of a mixtape, liquor line, Instagram boutique or invitation to join the cast of the new season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp. What are newly departed fools of Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration leaving with? I almost feel bad for the newly fired fools, who signed up to serve a disloyal, lazy thot who ultimately plays the shit out of each of them. I say \u201calmost\u201d\n\nbecause when you sign up to work for white supremacy\u2019s equivalent of the D-League, this is what your ass gets.\n\n\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nTo that end, let us begin with Anthony Scaramucci, who somehow managed the feat of being fired before he officially started his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal as communications director especially hilarious is that he was just talking cash-money shit to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u201d The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c \u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "president", "45", "supremacy", "priebus", "spicer", "yalls", "im", "man", "scaramucci", "chief", "housewives", "house", "scaramuccis", "real", "turned"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

Keep in mind that this was the first time in weeks that the White House had allowed the press briefing to be televised. I\u2019m not sure when the press became such wimps, but one reporter, Brian Karem, a correspondent for Playboy, had enough.\n\n\n\nSuckabee was pushing as proof of fake news the resignation of three CNN employees over their work on a Russia-Trump investigative piece. Now, CNN stated in announcing the resignations that the story didn\u2019t meet its journalistic standards, but there has been no proof that the story itself was false. But in any case, Karem had heard enough, and in a room full of media, he interrupted Suckabee to accuse her of making inflammatory remarks. Watch the heated exchange below:\n\nIn that moment, Karem stood up not only for CNN but for all the journalists who have been dying for someone to push back against this fake-news narrative the White House \u201ctrumpets\u201d whenever stories are written of which President Vladimir Trumpelstiltskin doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nOn Wednesday, Karem told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that the confrontation was a long time coming.\n\n\u201cWe are bullied and browbeaten every day, and I pretty much have had enough of it,\u201d Karem said. \u201cThere\u2019s really only two ways to deal with a bully: turn them into your friend, [but] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a possibility, or let them know exactly what\u2019s up, and you\u2019re not going to take the bullying anymore. We can\u2019t take the bullying anymore. It\u2019s undermining the Fourth Estate, it\u2019s undermining the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nKarem added that the president\u2019s relentless pursuit of the fake-news narrative was, at its core, an assault on democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reporters I know in that room\u2014even Breitbart, those people are responsible; for the government to sit there and undermine, essentially, what is an essential checks and balances in the system, it\u2019s a bit disheartening,\u201d Karem said, Raw Story reports. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving. I can\u2019t take it anymore, it\u2019s nuts.\u201d\n\nKarem is right. Since Russia handed Trumpelstiltskin the election, the president has bullied the media, and his tactics have proved to be effective. When it was announced that press briefings wouldn\u2019t be televised, the media did not protest the decision; instead they complied with the White House\u2019s request and bitched about it on social media.\n\n\u201cWhat it speaks to is dissolving the independent media, and that\u2019s what\u2014it\u2019s trying to co-opt the media, make us, if we don\u2019t print what they want or broadcast what they like, we\u2019re automatically fake media,\u201d Karem said on Morning Joe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarem added that the fake-news narrative is arguably one of the only strategies the White House has, and it\u2019s been consistent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few strategies i\u2019ve seen from this White House, and it has been ongoing,\u201d Karem said. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t lump everybody in with that. They\u2019ve done some things that are incredibly open\u2014adding Skype to their press briefings, bringing in members of the Cabinet for briefings\u2014but at the same time, when the president of the United States, even [Wednesday] morning, is tweeting out \u2018fake media,\u2019 and telling us we\u2019re the enemy of the people, he\u2019s enflaming the very people who got him in office. He\u2019s speaking to his base, and he\u2019s trying to undermine the very essence of what we do, and that\u2019s not good for this republic, it\u2019s not good for this country.

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump made his comments after the reasons he gave for firing FBI Director James Comey during an NBC interview Thursday were directly contradicted by statements made by others in the White House, including Vice President Mike Pence, meaning that the various explanations were at best misleading and, at worst, flat out lies.\n\nTrump sent out two tweets Friday suggesting that he would cancel White House press briefings and instead hand out written statements to communicate with the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent explanations have been given for Comey\u2019s firing, and the stories coming out of the Trump White House have changed each day since it happened. As the Post notes, this calls into question the credibility of not only press secretary Sean Spicer but also Pence, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway.\n\nSpicer told reporters Friday that the president was \u201cdismayed\u201d that the focus was on the accuracy of the statements delivered by his spokesmen.\n\n\u201cThe president is an active president. He keeps a very robust schedule,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think sometimes we don\u2019t have an opportunity to get in to see him and get his full thinking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are times you read a story where someone is trying to pull apart one word, one sentence \u2026 and make it a gotcha thing,\u201d Spicer added.\n\nAt the beginning, Trump\u2019s aides said that Comey\u2019s firing came at the suggestion of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, but by Wednesday the word was that Trump had been considering firing Comey for a long time, and made the final determination after hearing from Sessions and Rosenstein.\n\nAll along, his spokesmen have maintained that Trump\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the ongoing Russia investigation that Comey was overseeing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said that he made the decision to fire Comey on his own and that he would have done it regardless of what Rosenstein recommended, adding that he had been thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he came to his decision to fire Comey.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story; it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election th they should have won,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["white", "end", "president", "press", "threatens", "firing", "comey", "statements", "house", "briefings", "cant", "thing", "trump", "staff", "russia", "straight"], "polarity": 0.10148809523809524, "subjectivity": 0.4449404761904762},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["president", "white", "going", "notes", "victims", "teachers", "violent", "listening", "massshooting", "care", "remember", "house", "teacher", "trump", "check", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["seeking", "parkland", "fla", "far", "shooting", "douglas", "school", "stoneman", "gun", "right", "theories", "aide", "used", "state", "students", "reform", "survivors"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

Erricka Bridgeford is the leader of the love initiative this weekend dubbed a \u201cBaltimore Ceasefire\u201d or \u201cBaltimore Peace Challenge,\u201d with activities for the community and young people that offer a promise. That promise is that no one will shoot anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sacred time where we remember our collective power and purpose,\u201d Bridgeford says. \u201cThe goal is not to just promote a cease-fire, but to talk to each other about what you\u2019re going through in life that made you vulnerable to be involved in violence, and getting the resources you need, and then make a commitment to not be violent.\u201d\n\nBridgeford, who lost her brother to a shooting, was alarmed when her son told her the numbers of homicides had risen past what they had been in previous years. A friend named Ogun had suggested a cease-fire to Bridgeford before. She knew that it was time to act, so she called him up. They both insisted that the focus be a celebration of life and the movement be based on self-determination. When people ask who is calling a cease-fire, Bridgeford hopes that city residents will answer, \u201cMe! You joining me?\u201d\n\nBridgeford has worked as the director of training for Community Mediation Maryland since 2001, mediating wherever there\u2019s a space that needs one\u2014whether it\u2019s between police and residents or young people and other young people. Still, she doesn\u2019t consider herself a leader of this cease-fire effort; it is something, she says, that belongs to all city residents. Given that, it\u2019s up to residents to create activities for the cease-fire weekend and empower themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActivities this weekend will include a trauma surgeon discussing the epidemic of gun violence as a health crisis; cleansing the city with sage in places where residents think cleansing is needed; bringing an item, like a balloon or teddy bear, to places where lives have been lost; resource fairs; and a table at the annual rivalry football game between the Baltimore City College High School and Baltimore Polytechnic Institute High School on Saturday.\n\nBaltimorean Sharon Smith Colvin lost her 17-year-old son to gun violence on Sept. 11, 2014. From that day forward, she said, her life changed. She struggles daily: \u201cMy mood changes every day. When I think I will have a bright and sunny day, it is not. It\u2019s rough. I know how it can bear on your health just living daily with it. It was a struggle to talk. A struggle getting up. I knew if I didn\u2019t start my healing process, I was going to be in a mental institution or sick in the hospital.\u201d\n\nColvin is working with other parents who have lost children to start a nonprofit that will help with funeral costs and provide someone they can talk to about their daily struggles. Colvin hopes to be able to attend the cease-fire but is unsure because she is attending a funeral of a friend who lost his mother and son in the same week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been treating the disease of gun violence using policing, and we were wrong in that,\u201d said Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott, who will be attending the cease-fire. \u201cGun violence is a disease and should be treated from a public health standpoint.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time this year that Baltimore activists have called for a cease-fire. In August the aim was for a 72-hour cease-fire, but it only lasted 41 hours before two homicides brought it to an end. Before the cease-fire, Baltimore was experiencing shootings and killings every 19 hours, according to Bridgeford.\n\nBut this cease-fire weekend has a little more hope for success: Some gang members, who respect both the community effort and Bridgeford, have vowed not to violate the cease-fire over the weekend. But mostly, Bridgeford hopes that the real success will come in the celebration of life. She doesn\u2019t want residents to be numb to the killings or have the people who\u2019ve lost their lives be reduced to just a number, or have the violence become normalized. What she hopes is that using both practical and spiritual healing tactics will promote change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are really doing a great job of organic, grassroots efforts not funded by any outside groups trying to make a political point,\u201d community activist Hassan Giordano said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t marching and chanting in places like City Hall, where things aren\u2019t happening. They are going in the hood, where things are actually happening.\n\n\u201cThe organizers are honest about it,\u201d Giordano continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to change anything overnight. They\u2019re not doing it in hopes that not a single murder is going to happen during that period of time. They are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s at least make a concerted effort in trying.\u2019\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["violence", "going", "baltimore", "ceasefire", "reach", "lost", "homicides", "residents", "300", "bridgeford", "hopes", "weekend", "baltimores", "activists", "city"], "polarity": 0.0330564182194617, "subjectivity": 0.40978778467908905},

Erricka Bridgeford is the leader of the love initiative this weekend dubbed a \u201cBaltimore Ceasefire\u201d or \u201cBaltimore Peace Challenge,\u201d with activities for the community and young people that offer a promise. That promise is that no one will shoot anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sacred time where we remember our collective power and purpose,\u201d Bridgeford says. \u201cThe goal is not to just promote a cease-fire, but to talk to each other about what you\u2019re going through in life that made you vulnerable to be involved in violence, and getting the resources you need, and then make a commitment to not be violent.\u201d\n\nBridgeford, who lost her brother to a shooting, was alarmed when her son told her the numbers of homicides had risen past what they had been in previous years. A friend named Ogun had suggested a cease-fire to Bridgeford before. She knew that it was time to act, so she called him up. They both insisted that the focus be a celebration of life and the movement be based on self-determination. When people ask who is calling a cease-fire, Bridgeford hopes that city residents will answer, \u201cMe! You joining me?\u201d\n\nBridgeford has worked as the director of training for Community Mediation Maryland since 2001, mediating wherever there\u2019s a space that needs one\u2014whether it\u2019s between police and residents or young people and other young people. Still, she doesn\u2019t consider herself a leader of this cease-fire effort; it is something, she says, that belongs to all city residents. Given that, it\u2019s up to residents to create activities for the cease-fire weekend and empower themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActivities this weekend will include a trauma surgeon discussing the epidemic of gun violence as a health crisis; cleansing the city with sage in places where residents think cleansing is needed; bringing an item, like a balloon or teddy bear, to places where lives have been lost; resource fairs; and a table at the annual rivalry football game between the Baltimore City College High School and Baltimore Polytechnic Institute High School on Saturday.\n\nBaltimorean Sharon Smith Colvin lost her 17-year-old son to gun violence on Sept. 11, 2014. From that day forward, she said, her life changed. She struggles daily: \u201cMy mood changes every day. When I think I will have a bright and sunny day, it is not. It\u2019s rough. I know how it can bear on your health just living daily with it. It was a struggle to talk. A struggle getting up. I knew if I didn\u2019t start my healing process, I was going to be in a mental institution or sick in the hospital.\u201d\n\nColvin is working with other parents who have lost children to start a nonprofit that will help with funeral costs and provide someone they can talk to about their daily struggles. Colvin hopes to be able to attend the cease-fire but is unsure because she is attending a funeral of a friend who lost his mother and son in the same week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been treating the disease of gun violence using policing, and we were wrong in that,\u201d said Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott, who will be attending the cease-fire. \u201cGun violence is a disease and should be treated from a public health standpoint.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time this year that Baltimore activists have called for a cease-fire. In August the aim was for a 72-hour cease-fire, but it only lasted 41 hours before two homicides brought it to an end. Before the cease-fire, Baltimore was experiencing shootings and killings every 19 hours, according to Bridgeford.\n\nBut this cease-fire weekend has a little more hope for success: Some gang members, who respect both the community effort and Bridgeford, have vowed not to violate the cease-fire over the weekend. But mostly, Bridgeford hopes that the real success will come in the celebration of life. She doesn\u2019t want residents to be numb to the killings or have the people who\u2019ve lost their lives be reduced to just a number, or have the violence become normalized. What she hopes is that using both practical and spiritual healing tactics will promote change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are really doing a great job of organic, grassroots efforts not funded by any outside groups trying to make a political point,\u201d community activist Hassan Giordano said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t marching and chanting in places like City Hall, where things aren\u2019t happening.

I\u2019ve written about our children being found guilty of being black and free, and how it is hard not to hate, hard not to want to turn to reciprocal violence, just once, to send the message, \u201cOur children\u2019s lives are fucking worth it.\u201d\n\nIt was only recently, though, while reading Marc Lamont Hill\u2019s book Nobody: Casualties of America\u2019s War on the Vulnerable, From Ferguson to Flint and Beyond, that I realized how deeply this trauma runs. The recitation of facts that we know so well: Trayvon, forever 17 years old, was just walking to the store during the halftime show of the NBA All-Star Game when he was profiled, stalked and ultimately killed by George Zimmerman; Jordan Davis, forever 17 years old, was just listening to music at a convenience store when he was murdered by Michael Dunn ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I had to stop, I literally had to close the book, because I still hear Trayvon\u2019s terrified, frantic, high-pitched screams and how they pierced my heart. He was a baby.\n\nI still see Jordan\u2019s friends recount how they had to speed away with their friend, their boy, bleeding out in the car, after they had all been shot at by an angry white supremacist.\n\nOur babies.\n\nAnd those images, those screams, that blood, that death, is what I saw when I heard Alonzo Cox\u2019s piercing screams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause we know that it is only the luck of the draw that he is still alive.\n\nWe know that is the reality of being black in America.\n\nI watch my eldest son, only 12 years old, grow larger and taller, and I can\u2019t help envisioning him at the wrong gas station, walking at the wrong time, moving too fast, too slow, not smiling widely enough, smiling too wide, asserting his rights, living, breathing, existing, and a white supremacist or a cop\u2014not that the two are mutually exclusive\u2014deciding that he\u2019s just another dangerous, soulless black body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey won\u2019t care that he has a mother waiting at home for him. They won\u2019t care that he has a father waiting at home for him. They won\u2019t care that he has brothers and uncles and aunts and cousins who love him.\n\nIn this country, whether my sons will eventually encounter police officers predisposed to killing them is not a matter of if but when; whether they leave that encounter still breathing is a nightmare that strangles my heart until I wake up gasping for air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I can do is keep writing for our lives; keep speaking out about this deep-seated structural brutality that gives permission for adults sworn to protect and serve to assault unarmed children; keep speaking out when they gun them down and go on paid vacation for their troubles.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s all I can do, and it\u2019s not enough. It can never be enough.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to get shot that\u2019s all that was going through my mind, \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot me.\u2019 I was scared for my life.\u201d \u2014Alonzo Cox, 16\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat those Baltimore cops did to Alonzo was cruel and it was unnecessary, but I have no doubt that they slept just fine after assaulting an unarmed child, because that\u2019s what monsters do.\n\nStill ...

Heber Brown III, who led many of the peaceful protests after the death of Freddie Gray. \u201cThis is not about a few bad individual officers. This is about an unjust system that is flawed at its foundation and will require more than incremental reform.\u201d\n\nBaltimore attorney J. Wyndal Gordon, who has worked to reform the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, which obstructs accountability for officers in brutality cases, said the crux of the problems laid out in the report relates to lack of accountability.\n\nDuring a ride-along with Department of Justice officials, according to the report, a police sergeant instructed a patrol officer to stop a group of young African-American men on a street corner, question them and then order them to disperse. When the patrol officer protested that he had no valid reason to stop the group, the sergeant replied, \u201cThen make something up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had no idea that while they\u2019re doing these ride-alongs, that the Justice Department would cite them on their behavior. They just don\u2019t have any concept of it,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cBecause it is so rare that anyone says or does anything about their behavior. It creates a lawless environment where there is no redress. No one believes the allegations of the citizens. They don\u2019t give them any credit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, current Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has had several judgments filed against him and awarded to citizens because he violated their rights.\n\nDavis was part of a group of Prince George's County police officers who took a teenager on a drive that led to a federal civil jury awarding the victim, Brian Romjue, a $90,000 judgment. According to testimony by Romjue, Davis slammed his head against a window three or four times. Another officer grabbed him from behind and choked him. An internal investigation by the Police Department found no wrongdoing on the part of the officers. In another lawsuit, a defendant was awarded $12,500 by a jury after a lawsuit alleged that Davis \"threw him to the ground and handcuffed him without explanation.\"\n\n\u201cWhen you have a commissioner like Kevin Davis as an example of what you can become\u2014it lets you know this type of behavior has been excusable for a long time,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cWhat type of job allows that kind of ascension to occur other than a police department because they wear that kind of behavior as a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most striking points of the report note that these kind of abuses persisted in public view, unchecked, and subsequently became normalized. Zero tolerance policies instituted in the late 1990s under Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley only exacerbated the problems.\n\n\u201cThe black political leadership that consistently chose to support O\u2019Malley and his administration should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said local activist Hassan Giordano. \u201cOftentimes, these black officials represent the interests if the Democratic Party before that of their own people.\u201d\n\nBaltimore activists and lawyers note the war on drugs that preceded zero tolerance, as well as Jim Crow laws, also provided the impetus for rampant abuse of power. Countless historic rebellions have begun with a police brutality case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report, the DOJ notes that the Baltimore Police Department disproportionately searches African Americans during stops: \u201cBPD searched African Americans more frequently during pedestrian and vehicle stops, even though searches of African Americans were less likely to discover contraband. Indeed, BPD officers found contraband twice as often when searching white individuals compared to African Americans during vehicle stops and 50 percent more often during pedestrian stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say it\u2019s a war on drugs, but they didn\u2019t wage war on the white neighborhoods where they do just as much drugs as they do in black neighborhoods. It was a war on African Americans,\u201d said Gordon.\n\nCouncilman Brandon M. Scott, who represents the 2nd District and is well-respected by activists in Baltimore, saw the report as a step in the right direction, but emphasized that there are broader problems around the city, including entrenched poverty and lack of resources around schools and recreation centers; issues that need to be addressed concurrently with police reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis country is undergoing change around policing,\u201d said Scott. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Baltimore. People want police to be held accountable. This is America. And America has problems with black people, young black men like myself in particular. If we don\u2019t deal with that or fix that, we\u2019re going to continue to have these things happen.\u201d\n\nMoving forward from the report, Gordon says citizens need to continue to put pressure on the legislature and that the Baltimore Police Department needs to agree to the consent decree to get the ball rolling.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an independent agency to investigate police officers, separate from police and the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Gordon said regarding reforms that can begin to address the issues outlined in the report. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that police should individually carry some kind of insurance policy or at least pay a deductible. If they were paying a deductible every time they were sued, we would see a decrease in police misconduct.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome residents are skeptical and are waiting to see what actual reforms come out of the report. Baltimore has a thriving nonprofit industry to address poverty, but, according to the DOJ report: \u201cCompared to national averages, Baltimore exhibits: lower incomes, with a median household income nearly 20 percent lower than the national average; higher poverty rates, with 24.2 percent of individuals living below the federal poverty level \u2026 [with] average unemployment rates per month that were 50 percent higher than the national average from 2014 to 2015.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is healthy skepticism among residents that the DOJ report will do more to create careers, contracts and credibility for white-led institutions than it will do to address the pattern of violations of constitutional rights and human rights abuses,\u201d said the Rev.

Here\u2019s a sampling of some of the worst acts by the BPD contained within it.\n\n\n\n1. Missing headlight leads to an anal-cavity search of a Baltimore woman (pages 32-33).\n\nThe DOJ found that the BPD routinely conducted unconstitutional strip searches, often in full view of the public. One of the most egregious searches involved a woman pulled over for a simple traffic stop for a missing headlight. The woman\u2019s race is never mentioned, but the likelihood that she was white is pretty slim. As the DOJ noted, there were \u201ctwo Baltimores,\u201d where wealthy, white residents were treated \u201crespectful\u201d by BPD and found the department \u201cresponsive to their needs.\u201d For the mostly poor, black residents? Not so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the woman was stopped, the report goes into excruciating detail:\n\n\n\nOfficers ordered the woman to exit her vehicle, remove her clothes, and stand on the sidewalk to be searched. The woman asked the male officer in charge \u201cI really gotta take all my clothes off?\u201d The male officer replied \u201cyeah\u201d and ordered a female officer to strip search the woman. The female officer then put on purple latex gloves, pulled up the woman\u2019s shirt and searched around her bra. Finding no weapons or contraband around the woman\u2019s chest, the officer then pulled down the woman\u2019s underwear and searched her anal cavity. This search again found no evidence of wrongdoing and the officers released the woman without charges. Indeed, the woman received only a repair order for her headlight. The search occurred in full view of the street, although the supervising male officer claimed he \u201cturned away\u201d and did not watch the woman disrobe.\n\nThe male officer was only mildly reprimanded.\n\n\n\n2. Sergeant tells officer to make up a reason to stop a group of black men \u2026 even while DOJ investigators are in the car (Page 30).\n\nLet the DOJ tell it:\n\n\n\nDuring a ride-along with Justice Department officials, a BPD sergeant instructed a patrol officer to stop a group of young African-American males on a street corner, question them, and order them to disperse. When the patrol officer protested that he had no valid reason to stop the group, the sergeant replied \u201cThen make something up.\u201d This incident is far from anomalous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear: A superior officer tells a subordinate to just flat out violate the constitutional rights of a group of black men, all while the DOJ investigators are with them to investigate whether the BPD is violating residents\u2019 constitutional rights. That\u2019s just f\u2014ked up.\n\n\n\n3. Unlawful stop ends with a beating, a tasing and a visit to the hospital (pages 29-30).\n\nDetaining citizens for no reason is standard operating procedure for the BPD, according to the DOJ, which found \u201ca widespread pattern of BPD officers stopping and detaining people on Baltimore streets without reasonable suspicion that they are involved in criminal activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a cold night in January 2013, officers stopped a black man wearing a hoodie in a so-called high-crime area. Although the officer had no reason to stop the man, the officer \u201cthought it could be possible that the individual could be out seeking a victim of opportunity.\u201d Several officers showed up and began questioning the man and seized a knife that he admitted he was carrying.\n\nWhen the man asked for his knife back, officers ordered him to the ground and attempted to handcuff him. As two officers tried to handcuff him, the man began resisting arrest and another officer began hitting him with his fist, striking him in the face, ribs and back. Another officer arrived and tased the man twice. After the man was finally handcuffed, he was taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. He was ultimately never charged with any crime.\n\n\n\n4. Sexual assault victim called a \u201cconniving little whore\u201d (Page 122).\n\nIn addition to its racially biased and abusive tactics, the BPD\u2019s handling of sexual assaults \u201craised serious concerns of gender-based policing,\u201d including questioning victims in a manner that blamed them for their assaults. Failure to believe victims\u2019 claims was commonplace. Included in the report was an email in which a BPD officer and a prosecutor expressed disbelief of a victim\u2019s sexual assault claims: \u201c[T]he prosecutor wrote that \u2018this case is crazy \u2026 I am not excited about charging it. This victim seems like a conniving little whore. (pardon my language).\u2019; the BPD officer replied, \u2018Lmao! I feel the same.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the DOJ found evidence that the BPD \u201ctargeted members of a vulnerable population\u2014people involved in the sex trade\u2014to coerce sexual favors from them in exchange for avoiding arrest, or for cash or narcotics. This conduct is not only criminal, it is an abuse of power\u201d (Page 149).\n\n\n\n5. Black grandmother shoved against a wall, called a \u201cbitch\u201d (Page 67).\n\nEven though black men were often the targets of the BPD, the department proved that age and gender offered little protection from police abuse. From the report:\n\n\n\nThe City paid $95,000 in 2012 to settle a lawsuit brought by an 87-year-old African-American grandmother who alleged that she was shoved against a wall after she refused to allow an officer to enter her basement to conduct a warrantless search. After shoving the woman to the floor, the officer allegedly stood over her and said, \u201cBitch, you ain\u2019t no better than any of the other old black bitches I have locked up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. BPD officers use the n-word (multiple times) and then hide the fact that they use the n-word\u2014multiple times (pages 62, 66-70).\n\nThroughout its investigation, the DOJ found multiple examples of officers using racial slurs or racially biased statements toward African Americans. When the DOJ looked at six years of complaint data that it received from the BPD, they found one\u2014one\u2014complaint that the BPD classified as a racial slur. The DOJ called bulls\u2014t, stating it \u201cimplausible\u201d that there was only one complaint in six years. When the feds manually reviewed BPD\u2019s complaint data, they found 60 more complaints for just the use of the n-word, but the complaints were misclassified as a lesser offense.\n\n\n\n7. Black man stopped 30 times in less than four years\u00ad \u2026 and isn\u2019t charged with anything (Page 51).\n\nBlack Baltimore residents were seemingly stopped by police simply for leaving their homes. According to the DOJ, \u201cBPD disproportionately stops African Americans standing, walking, or driving on Baltimore streets.\u201d And multiple stops were par for the course: \u201cAfrican Americans accounted for 95 percent of the 410 individuals stopped at least 10 times by BPD officers from 2010-2015. During this period, BPD stopped 34 African Americans at least 20 times and seven other African Americans at least 30 times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne black man in his mid-50s was stopped 30 times in less than four years. Reasons given for the stop: loitering, trespassing and a police investigation.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "directly", "dont", "gun", "right", "terrorist", "legal", "deaths", "nra", "second", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Brian Rice has been acquitted of all charges relating to the in-custody death of Freddie Gray in April 2015, WBAL-TV reports.\n\nRice, the highest-ranking Baltimore police officer to face charges in the case, and the fourth of six officers involved to go to trial, was facing charges of manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. Prosecutors had decided to drop a second misconduct-in-office charge relating to Gray's arrest, and Judge Barry Williams also dismissed an assault charge, the news station notes.\n\nIn the end, on Monday, Williams acquitted Rice of all charges.\n\nWilliams said that prosecutors failed to prove that Rice's actions were criminal and that while Rice showed bad judgment in not securing Gray in the police van with a seat belt, it is not a crime. There was no evidence presented, he said, that Rice knew of the policy that required arrestees to be secured. The judge said that he could not make \"assumptions of presumptions\" in making his decision, WBAL-TV notes.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake released a statement shortly after the verdict urging for patience as Rice moves forward to face an administrative review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Now that the criminal case has come to an end, Lt.

He and two other officers confronted Gray after Gray started running when Rice made eye contact with him, the report notes.\n\nOfficers Caesar Goodson Jr. and Edward Nero, who also decided to have bench trials instead of jury trials, were previously acquitted by Williams. Goodson, who was driving the van at the time of Gray's injury, was acquitted of all charges last month, including his most serious charge of second-degree depraved-heart murder. Nero was acquitted in May.

Full disclosure: I\u2019m in the documentary. It explores the stories of biracial black-and-white children born after the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which outlawed the ban on interracial marriage in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve watched all of the episodes intently and with a lot of curiosity. It was very well produced, and I believe it touched on many interesting facets of the \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d experience that I\u2019d never thought about. One could say that it was provocative and got the people going. I had some thoughts.\n\n1. Last November, I received a message from Lacey Schwartz about including me in a digital documentary on black-white biracial children. For the vast majority of my adult life\u2014and hell, even my youth\u2014I didn\u2019t spend much time talking about or \u201cbeing\u201d biracial. Yeah, I\u2019m mixed, but, well, nobody cared. At least in my life, anyway. So going into the filming of my interview, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but I enjoyed the experience.\n\n2. Regarding the documentary itself, I enjoyed it as a whole. The producers did a good job bringing various types of folks together, each telling a diverse story about what it\u2019s like being biracial in America. There were different viewpoints\u2014many of us consider ourselves black with white parents, while others view themselves as mixed or biracial, and we all have our reasons for those decisions. The presentation of perspectives was well-done.\n\n\n\n3. On a personal level, I not only root for everybody black\u2014I typically just assign everybody who \u201clooks mixed\u201d to the black community until they tell me otherwise. It\u2019s just easier for my own life, and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. Do you, boo, of course. Live your life, and this above all: To thine own self be true. But I did learn something from those whose decision isn\u2019t so black and white. Pun intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I\u2019m not a unicorn, of course, but I have normalized my own existence for my sanity, and it turns out it\u2019s not normal at all. Though I\u2019m mixed, I was not raised that way and largely wasn\u2019t raised by my white mother. I was raised by a black woman, and I can\u2019t overstate the importance of that fact for how it influenced my sense of self. The entire third episode, \u201cComing of Age,\u201d is about growing up mixed, and, well, I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m not in that episode at all (there are other folks who aren\u2019t, too), and it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have any of those difficult self-identity episodes or struggles. White people were the feds. I stayed on the black-hand side with my people and nobody ever questioned it. It\u2019s interesting, though. The stories of people who did have to contend with that identity struggle and their socialization aren\u2019t necessarily new.\n\n5. I\u2019d like to thank my parents for shielding me, whether intentionally or (more likely) accidentally, from any of those struggles growing up. Life is hard enough for kids in school; I can\u2019t imagine fighting \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d battles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I actually wonder if anybody knew\u2014in high school, anyway\u2014or thought my mother was white at all until I told them. When my family moved to Alabama, we moved there with my dad and black mother. She was there for everything\u2014my dad was stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., and he\u2019d be there during the week and home on weekends\u2014so I\u2019m guessing nobody thought twice about it. I remember telling a few of my friends in my AP English class once (though I have no idea how it came up) and nobody believing me. Everybody was like, \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen your mama.\u201d\n\nIn college, that same thing happened; nobody knew until I told them. Nothing profound here, but I wonder how different my story would be if I looked more \u201cmixed.\u201d\n\n7. I have talked to my little sister about this: I do sometimes wonder what life would have been like had we been raised by our white mother. Not for a lack of trying, but I think life would have been a lot harder. We weren\u2019t exactly living well when we were with her. I remember struggles and hardship. But also, it would have literally been just us and my white single mother. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have turned out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe I\u2019d be one of those folks who identify as mixed so as not to erase my mother (as I\u2019ve been told that I do). I doubt I\u2019d be as \u201cblack\u201d as I am. I\u2019d most likely have grown up outside of Detroit in smaller, more rural communities. I love my life, so I\u2019m not yearning for any alternatives, but I have thought about an upbringing where the only black music I listened to was Michael Jackson and, oddly, Peaches and Herb. My mother loves \u201cReunited.\u201d\n\n8. Since I wrote that article on my mother back in August, I\u2019ve spent more time being mixed than I ever have in life. Being mixed has been exhausting. I may delve further into that one day, but man, I cannot imagine having spent the entirety of my life attempting to deal with two racial identities and providing active space for them both. I\u2019ve never spent this much time analyzing my family racial dynamics, and it\u2019s, like, a lot. I\u2019m good, b. Wakanda forever and shit.\n\n9. I want to thank Lacey, Anna Holmes and Mehret Mandefro for having me be part of this documentary. It\u2019s kind of cool when what you write gets you asked to be part of a project that can exist for eternity and allow you to revisit yourself in the future to see how you\u2019ve changed (or not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I think the underpinning of all my thoughts on being biracial is how vital the role your parents play in shaping a positive self-image and healthy self-esteem. Your parents\u2019 politics (or lack thereof) are going to be a heavy influence on your own, especially while you\u2019re young. I like to think of myself as pretty grounded, and I know I owe that entirely to my parents and the life they surrounded me with\u2014again, whether entirely intentional or not.", "keywords": ["white", "id", "generation", "black", "mother", "parents", "virginia", "documentary", "kids", "biracial", "im", "episode", "thoughts", "born", "v", "loving", "mixed", "life"], "polarity": 0.09316399835796385, "subjectivity": 0.4276539408866995},

I have loved this show ever since it was a part of Fox\u2019s old black-night trifecta alongside Martin and New York Undercover. Insert a moment of silence for Eddie Torres here.\n\n\n\nWhile I hold all these shows near and dear, you notice things about them upon viewing them as an adult. When it comes to Living Single specifically, while I missed a few things, I\u2019m noticing in hindsight that what I loved most about this show was captured in its first and second seasons. Those two seasons were like the television equivalent of all of the 1990s black romantic comedies that I loved. And then there were the next two seasons, which were fine but not as strong as the first two.\n\nI can live with that and still enjoy them\u2014well, the third more than the fourth, but I don\u2019t want to piss off Alderwoman Maxine Shaw. Having said that, while many of us have been talking about the best of Living Single, little has been said about the final season. That\u2019s probably for good reason: It was strange and, in some cases, quite terrible.\n\n\n\nAgain, I love Living Single, but by the fifth season, it was like the show ran out of gas and then exploded in a Taco Bell parking lot.\n\nThe final season was also its shortest, and to God be the glory for that because fans had suffered enough by then. In the first episode we meet Tripp, who seemed nice and all, but it\u2019s the fifth season: We don\u2019t want to meet any new damn people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second episode, Kyle Barker flees for London. You know, I didn\u2019t really love hearing Kyle Barker sing all that much, but he was way too integral to the show to just up and go. For the record, I still blame Maxine for running his ass away. Yes, she was a groundbreaking character and a pioneer in gluttony, but it was her fault.\n\nIn the third episode, we start repeating storylines, e.g., Khadijah James dating another basketball player. But, like, didn\u2019t she already goof up with Grant Hill in the second season? How does she still not know how to date a baller? It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t learn until that movie with Common. Yeah, I know they had different names and lives concocted, but y\u2019all know that character in Just Wright was just Khadijah with a second career after the media bubble of the 2000s and the recession. I assume by then, Flavor magazine went under and she went back to school.\n\nLater, we get episodes that center on Overton, Tripp and Russell. Russell is amusing if you\u2019re into sexual harassment and Jamaican accents that are a D-plus at best, but we never cared that much about him, did we? No. The answer is no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Tripp, well, I already told y\u2019all my stance on him was, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d Speaking of new people, back then, I was happy that former MTV VJ Idalis DeLe\u00f3n found some acting work, but I didn\u2019t care about her, either, and the show never gave me that great a reason.\n\nThen there were episodes like \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d where Synclaire disguises herself as a man. You know, this show fell into those goofy tricks 1990s sitcoms used to employ to keep the machine going and pay their mortgage, but I truly wish they found something more to do with Kim Coles\u2019 talent.\n\n\n\nAs for the other Kim, the legendary Kim Fields (we will ignore her time on The Real Housewives of Atlanta), she didn\u2019t even make it to the damn finale. She finally gets a rich man and is so damn happy about it that she can\u2019t tell our black asses goodbye? Maybe she knew the last few episodes were only going to get worse, and since she was the high-saditty character, she couldn\u2019t keep suffering like this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t deserve to suffer, though, \u2019cause that finale was the fool. We do get Kyle Barker back\u2014but by way of a story that involves him being the anonymous sperm donor Maxine picked out? Really?! We\u2019re going to end on \u201cBig Wave Barker\u201d?\n\nDid everyone just give up by then?\n\nOf all the times those two have had sex, it was the field trip to the sperm clinic that miraculously made these two parents? And isn\u2019t she a lawyer? Wouldn\u2019t she know he would have no legal rights, so if she was that over him, she could keep on pushing? Oh, wait, I\u2019m supposed to find all of this romantic. As if it\u2019s some kind of spin on Look Who\u2019s Talking.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least Scooter\u2019s difficult ass showed up for Khadijah at the very last minute, but for all the love we declare about this show and the talk of a potential reboot, when I think about this final season, I am reminded of how bad it was and how much would have to fundamentally change in order for this show to be watchable in this century.\n\nIt can\u2019t be as silly as the show became with time. Where will they all be living? Will Queen Latifah be running a digital site and bitter because reporting is expensive and opinion pieces are paying the brownstone she refuses to sell to the colonizers? Is Maxine Shaw a TV judge in Atlanta but moves back to New York? What is Synclaire doing? Tell me we don\u2019t have to pretend Tripp ever existed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying a reboot is impossible, but some shows are easier tweaked than others. There\u2019s Will & Grace and then there\u2019s a bunch of other newly announced reboots that I know I will not be interested in watching. I was rooting for a Living Single reboot until I revisited how it ended.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease do not be mad at me for anything I\u2019ve written, Queen Latifah and blacks. Please don\u2019t get me out of Wakanda for the thoughts and concerns expressed here. It\u2019s just that we have to be honest about how this show ended if it is to be reborn.

According to the station, the 46-year-old was also acquitted on all of the other charges he faced: three counts of manslaughter, second-degree assault, two counts of vehicular manslaughter, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment.\n\nClosing arguments in Goodson's trial, which lasted eight days, were presented Monday.

Fellow Officer Edward Nero, who was acquitted of his charges by the same judge in May, testified in the case on Goodson's behalf.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, Judge Barry Williams said that prosecutors\u2019 theories about Gray having received a \"rough ride\" were not backed by sufficient evidence.\n\n\"The court cannot simply let things speak for themselves,\" he said in his ruling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams said that \"rough ride\" was an \"inflammatory term\" that is \"not to be taken lightly,\" and prosecutors did not prove their case.\n\nProsecutors had accused Goodson of having five chances to render aid to Gray after he suffered his ultimately fatal neck injury in the back of the van, which they said demonstrated a \"depraved heart.\" They also accused Goodson of being the direct cause of Gray's injuries, by driving the van recklessly so that Gray\u2014 shackled, but not restrained by a seat belt\u2014was tossed about in the back of the van.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

Goodson faces the most serious charges out of the six officers connected to Gray's death.\n\nGoodson's charges include second-degree depraved-heart murder (a murder committed with indifference to human life), involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. The murder charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.\n\nBefore closing arguments were delivered, Goodson and Officer Edward Nero exchanged handshakes and smiles at the front of the courtroom. Nero, acquitted of all charges in his trial last month, sat attentively and listened as the prosecution and the defense presented their final position.\n\nThe state argued that Goodson failed his constitutional duty as a police officer to protect the well-being of the detainee. Prosecutor Janice Beldsoe noted that several witnesses, including Officer Porter, testified that Goodson as the driver of the police van had the primary responsibility to ensure that Gray was safely transported.\n\n\"The state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he breached this duty,\" Bledsoe said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBledsoe argued that Goodson, a veteran police officer, not only was trained on how to place detainees in seat belts and when to call for medical treatment but also worked as a field-training officer for new recruits. Bledsoe noted that Goodson had the opportunity to place Gray in a seat belt on four different occasions and failed to notify his supervisor after making an unreported stop. Bledsoe claimed that during this stop, Gray suffered injuries that would prove to be life-threatening.\n\n\"No one goes into the wagon and looks to see what's going on with Gray,\" Bledsoe said. \"Instead they close the door and leave him.\"\n\nDefense attorney Matthew Fraling argued that Goodson acted as any reasonable officer would have and that the state did not prove its case that Gray had suffered a \"rough ride.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFraling claimed that Goodson didn\u2019t put Gray in a seat belt for fear of his own safety, that a gathering crowd presented a potential \u201cmob development\u201d and Gray was acting \"uncooperative, resistant and combative\" during the van ride.\n\n\"The continuum slides up and down between combative and docile, and those circumstances can change quickly,\" Fraling said.\n\nFraling seemed to blame Gray for his death by saying that Gray may have created a high degree of risk by allegedly changing his position in the back of the van.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the prosecution's case is proving that Goodson displayed malicious intent. It's not enough in a criminal case to say that Goodson didn't follow the guidelines of police protocol; the state has to prove that he did so with the intent to harm Gray.\n\n\"I think it will be difficult to prove Officer Goodson's state of mind that day,\" University of Baltimore law professor David Jaros said. \"The crime of gross negligence requires not just that you act unreasonably but that you were aware of the risks that you're taking. Goodson may think, \u2018I need to take this guy to the hospital, but I can take him in five minutes; I don't need to take him this second.\u2019 Then he hasn't committed a crime, even though he's done something that\u2019s terribly negligent.\"\n\nThe defense needs to prove not only that Goodson followed protocol using his best judgment but also that Gray's injuries may have been sustained by his own doing, a tactic that Tessa Hill-Aston, president of the Baltimore City chapter of the NAACP, finds insulting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The audacity for the defense to blame this on Freddie; how low can you go?\" Hill-Aston said. \"He was injured and he needed medical attention and he needed a seat belt.\"\n\nDespite the outcome, Hill-Aston feels that, in part, justice has been served.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office brought this to court,\" she said. \"For the Police Department, we are going to see things change. Police are on alert and realize they better think before they do something like this again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts note that a case like this is unprecedented.\n\n\"The judge is wrestling with a new situation of culpability,\" said Jaros. \"We have not seen prosecutors bring charges for police officers failing to protect a detainee and eventually causing his death.\"\n\n\"If there is a conviction on any of the charges, we're looking at a historic moment not just in Baltimore but throughout the country,\" said University of Maryland law professor Doug Colbert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've only seen four police officers convicted in nearly 10,000 deaths in the line of police duty.

But, like, didn\u2019t she already goof up with Grant Hill in the second season? How does she still not know how to date a baller? It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t learn until that movie with Common. Yeah, I know they had different names and lives concocted, but y\u2019all know that character in Just Wright was just Khadijah with a second career after the media bubble of the 2000s and the recession. I assume by then, Flavor magazine went under and she went back to school.\n\nLater, we get episodes that center on Overton, Tripp and Russell. Russell is amusing if you\u2019re into sexual harassment and Jamaican accents that are a D-plus at best, but we never cared that much about him, did we? No. The answer is no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Tripp, well, I already told y\u2019all my stance on him was, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d Speaking of new people, back then, I was happy that former MTV VJ Idalis DeLe\u00f3n found some acting work, but I didn\u2019t care about her, either, and the show never gave me that great a reason.\n\nThen there were episodes like \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d where Synclaire disguises herself as a man. You know, this show fell into those goofy tricks 1990s sitcoms used to employ to keep the machine going and pay their mortgage, but I truly wish they found something more to do with Kim Coles\u2019 talent.\n\n\n\nAs for the other Kim, the legendary Kim Fields (we will ignore her time on The Real Housewives of Atlanta), she didn\u2019t even make it to the damn finale. She finally gets a rich man and is so damn happy about it that she can\u2019t tell our black asses goodbye? Maybe she knew the last few episodes were only going to get worse, and since she was the high-saditty character, she couldn\u2019t keep suffering like this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t deserve to suffer, though, \u2019cause that finale was the fool. We do get Kyle Barker back\u2014but by way of a story that involves him being the anonymous sperm donor Maxine picked out? Really?! We\u2019re going to end on \u201cBig Wave Barker\u201d?\n\nDid everyone just give up by then?\n\nOf all the times those two have had sex, it was the field trip to the sperm clinic that miraculously made these two parents? And isn\u2019t she a lawyer? Wouldn\u2019t she know he would have no legal rights, so if she was that over him, she could keep on pushing? Oh, wait, I\u2019m supposed to find all of this romantic. As if it\u2019s some kind of spin on Look Who\u2019s Talking.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least Scooter\u2019s difficult ass showed up for Khadijah at the very last minute, but for all the love we declare about this show and the talk of a potential reboot, when I think about this final season, I am reminded of how bad it was and how much would have to fundamentally change in order for this show to be watchable in this century.\n\nIt can\u2019t be as silly as the show became with time. Where will they all be living? Will Queen Latifah be running a digital site and bitter because reporting is expensive and opinion pieces are paying the brownstone she refuses to sell to the colonizers? Is Maxine Shaw a TV judge in Atlanta but moves back to New York? What is Synclaire doing? Tell me we don\u2019t have to pretend Tripp ever existed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying a reboot is impossible, but some shows are easier tweaked than others. There\u2019s Will & Grace and then there\u2019s a bunch of other newly announced reboots that I know I will not be interested in watching. I was rooting for a Living Single reboot until I revisited how it ended.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease do not be mad at me for anything I\u2019ve written, Queen Latifah and blacks. Please don\u2019t get me out of Wakanda for the thoughts and concerns expressed here. It\u2019s just that we have to be honest about how this show ended if it is to be reborn.

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["90s", "id", "butch", "felt", "love", "jones", "living", "wanted", "women", "latifah", "style", "hiphop", "single", "shaped", "way"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

The clandestine practice, meant to punish a disruptive detainee and/or force a detainee to talk, involves arresting someone, handcuffing him or her, and intentionally putting the person in the van without securing him or her with a seat belt. Officers then take the detainee on a journey accelerating, braking and decelerating abruptly. Arrestees have crashed into walls, fallen off gurneys and died as a result of this practice.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely correct that he got a rough ride,\u201d said Tessa Hill-Aston, president of Baltimore City\u2019s NAACP, who has been in the courtroom regularly for all three trials. \u201cWe get a lot of complaints from the Western District for rough rides. It\u2019s still unclear why they were making so many stops. When you lock somebody up, you take them from one point to central booking.\u201d\n\nThe city has paid out millions to victims of rough rides who have been injured, including one man, Dondi Johnson Sr., who was paralyzed in 2005 after being recklessly driven around by police.\n\nDefense attorney Andrew Jay Graham countered that prosecutors will be unable to prove that Gray\u2019s death was intentional and argued that his death was the result of a \u201cfreakish accident\u201d in which Gray may have unintentionally injured himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe defense gave a strong opening, including the suggestion that Gray may have injured himself,\u201d said Doug Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cThey are planting seeds in order to get a reasonable doubt of guilt.\u201d\n\nGoodson, the driver of the van that transported Gray, is facing the most serious charges. The charges include second-degree depraved-heart murder (a murder committed with indifference to human life), involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment. The murder charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.\n\nAs part of the evidence that Goodson\u2019s driving was erratic, prosecutors referred to video showing him running a stop sign and then making a wild turn in which the van crosses the center yellow line. After Goodson ran the stop sign, he stopped the van (this was the van\u2019s second stop) and walked to the back doors to check on Gray. A minute or two later, Goodson called a dispatcher, radioing in that he \u201cneeds someone to check this prisoner out.\u201d The van was five minutes away from central booking. \u201cHe\u2019s stopping here because he knows Gray has been injured,\u201d Shatzow stated in opening arguments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe defense argued that officers regularly deal with detainees who fake injuries in order to go to the hospital instead of jail. Officers refer to it as \u201cjailitis.\u201d The defense argued that at stop 5, Gray was talking in a normal manner and none of the other officers on the scene thought he had a severe medical issue, and that by stop 6 Gray was unresponsive. A witness for the prosecution, Baltimore City Police Officer Brian Burke, said that it is not the job of the officer to determine whether a detainee is faking an injury. \u201cThe person should directed to a medic and they can make that determination,\u201d said Burke.\n\nThe case hinges on when Gray sustained his injuries and why Gray wasn\u2019t belted in. The prosecution said that Goodson, a veteran officer who knew and understood policy regarding the use of seat belts for detainees, \"had the ultimate responsibility for the safety of Mr. Gray.\" The defense has argued that Gray was a \u201ccombative\u201d detainee, but officers on the scene\u2014including Officer Edward Nero, who was acquitted in his trial, and Officer Garrett Miller, who has a pending trial\u2014testified that Gray was cooperative during the entire arrest process. According to the prosecution, evidence will show that Gray was injured before stop 4.\n\nBefore the trial began, there was a 90-minute hearing during which the defense argued that the case should be dismissed on a legal technicality because the prosecution did not submit evidence to the defense regarding an interview with witness Donta Allen, who shared the last leg of the van ride in the left partition with Gray. Although Allen could not see Gray, he initially testified that he heard loud banging that he attributed to Gray banging his head against the wall. He later recanted and said it sounded like \u201ca light tapping.\u201d In the third interview with prosecutors, he went back to his original statement that he heard loud banging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Barry G. Williams lambasted the prosecution for not following the law as it relates to submitting information in discovery. Williams denied the motion to dismiss the case but ordered the prosecution to submit by Monday any evidence they may not have submitted in pending trials, saying that he was concerned about what other information they may have withheld. The prosecution argued that Allen, who was arrested for buying a loose cigarette on the day Gray was arrested and had provided information in a cooperative effort so that he wasn't charged, wasn't a credible witness and that they didn't think the evidence was worthy of submission. The defense noted that they will be bringing in Allen as a defense witness for trial.", "keywords": ["officers", "victim", "defense", "officer", "rough", "injured", "freddie", "van", "argued", "prosecutor", "gray", "ride", "stop", "prosecution"], "polarity": 0.030211301044634382, "subjectivity": 0.36200142450142453},

I have loved this show ever since it was a part of Fox\u2019s old black-night trifecta alongside Martin and New York Undercover. Insert a moment of silence for Eddie Torres here.\n\n\n\nWhile I hold all these shows near and dear, you notice things about them upon viewing them as an adult. When it comes to Living Single specifically, while I missed a few things, I\u2019m noticing in hindsight that what I loved most about this show was captured in its first and second seasons. Those two seasons were like the television equivalent of all of the 1990s black romantic comedies that I loved. And then there were the next two seasons, which were fine but not as strong as the first two.\n\nI can live with that and still enjoy them\u2014well, the third more than the fourth, but I don\u2019t want to piss off Alderwoman Maxine Shaw. Having said that, while many of us have been talking about the best of Living Single, little has been said about the final season. That\u2019s probably for good reason: It was strange and, in some cases, quite terrible.\n\n\n\nAgain, I love Living Single, but by the fifth season, it was like the show ran out of gas and then exploded in a Taco Bell parking lot.\n\nThe final season was also its shortest, and to God be the glory for that because fans had suffered enough by then. In the first episode we meet Tripp, who seemed nice and all, but it\u2019s the fifth season: We don\u2019t want to meet any new damn people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second episode, Kyle Barker flees for London. You know, I didn\u2019t really love hearing Kyle Barker sing all that much, but he was way too integral to the show to just up and go. For the record, I still blame Maxine for running his ass away. Yes, she was a groundbreaking character and a pioneer in gluttony, but it was her fault.\n\nIn the third episode, we start repeating storylines, e.g., Khadijah James dating another basketball player. But, like, didn\u2019t she already goof up with Grant Hill in the second season? How does she still not know how to date a baller? It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t learn until that movie with Common. Yeah, I know they had different names and lives concocted, but y\u2019all know that character in Just Wright was just Khadijah with a second career after the media bubble of the 2000s and the recession. I assume by then, Flavor magazine went under and she went back to school.\n\nLater, we get episodes that center on Overton, Tripp and Russell. Russell is amusing if you\u2019re into sexual harassment and Jamaican accents that are a D-plus at best, but we never cared that much about him, did we? No. The answer is no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Tripp, well, I already told y\u2019all my stance on him was, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d Speaking of new people, back then, I was happy that former MTV VJ Idalis DeLe\u00f3n found some acting work, but I didn\u2019t care about her, either, and the show never gave me that great a reason.\n\nThen there were episodes like \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d where Synclaire disguises herself as a man. You know, this show fell into those goofy tricks 1990s sitcoms used to employ to keep the machine going and pay their mortgage, but I truly wish they found something more to do with Kim Coles\u2019 talent.\n\n\n\nAs for the other Kim, the legendary Kim Fields (we will ignore her time on The Real Housewives of Atlanta), she didn\u2019t even make it to the damn finale. She finally gets a rich man and is so damn happy about it that she can\u2019t tell our black asses goodbye? Maybe she knew the last few episodes were only going to get worse, and since she was the high-saditty character, she couldn\u2019t keep suffering like this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t deserve to suffer, though, \u2019cause that finale was the fool. We do get Kyle Barker back\u2014but by way of a story that involves him being the anonymous sperm donor Maxine picked out? Really?! We\u2019re going to end on \u201cBig Wave Barker\u201d?\n\nDid everyone just give up by then?\n\nOf all the times those two have had sex, it was the field trip to the sperm clinic that miraculously made these two parents? And isn\u2019t she a lawyer? Wouldn\u2019t she know he would have no legal rights, so if she was that over him, she could keep on pushing? Oh, wait, I\u2019m supposed to find all of this romantic.

Where will they all be living? Will Queen Latifah be running a digital site and bitter because reporting is expensive and opinion pieces are paying the brownstone she refuses to sell to the colonizers? Is Maxine Shaw a TV judge in Atlanta but moves back to New York? What is Synclaire doing? Tell me we don\u2019t have to pretend Tripp ever existed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying a reboot is impossible, but some shows are easier tweaked than others. There\u2019s Will & Grace and then there\u2019s a bunch of other newly announced reboots that I know I will not be interested in watching. I was rooting for a Living Single reboot until I revisited how it ended.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease do not be mad at me for anything I\u2019ve written, Queen Latifah and blacks. Please don\u2019t get me out of Wakanda for the thoughts and concerns expressed here. It\u2019s just that we have to be honest about how this show ended if it is to be reborn.

Full disclosure: I\u2019m in the documentary. It explores the stories of biracial black-and-white children born after the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which outlawed the ban on interracial marriage in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve watched all of the episodes intently and with a lot of curiosity. It was very well produced, and I believe it touched on many interesting facets of the \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d experience that I\u2019d never thought about. One could say that it was provocative and got the people going. I had some thoughts.\n\n1. Last November, I received a message from Lacey Schwartz about including me in a digital documentary on black-white biracial children. For the vast majority of my adult life\u2014and hell, even my youth\u2014I didn\u2019t spend much time talking about or \u201cbeing\u201d biracial. Yeah, I\u2019m mixed, but, well, nobody cared. At least in my life, anyway. So going into the filming of my interview, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but I enjoyed the experience.\n\n2. Regarding the documentary itself, I enjoyed it as a whole. The producers did a good job bringing various types of folks together, each telling a diverse story about what it\u2019s like being biracial in America. There were different viewpoints\u2014many of us consider ourselves black with white parents, while others view themselves as mixed or biracial, and we all have our reasons for those decisions. The presentation of perspectives was well-done.\n\n\n\n3. On a personal level, I not only root for everybody black\u2014I typically just assign everybody who \u201clooks mixed\u201d to the black community until they tell me otherwise. It\u2019s just easier for my own life, and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. Do you, boo, of course. Live your life, and this above all: To thine own self be true. But I did learn something from those whose decision isn\u2019t so black and white. Pun intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I\u2019m not a unicorn, of course, but I have normalized my own existence for my sanity, and it turns out it\u2019s not normal at all. Though I\u2019m mixed, I was not raised that way and largely wasn\u2019t raised by my white mother. I was raised by a black woman, and I can\u2019t overstate the importance of that fact for how it influenced my sense of self. The entire third episode, \u201cComing of Age,\u201d is about growing up mixed, and, well, I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m not in that episode at all (there are other folks who aren\u2019t, too), and it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have any of those difficult self-identity episodes or struggles. White people were the feds. I stayed on the black-hand side with my people and nobody ever questioned it. It\u2019s interesting, though. The stories of people who did have to contend with that identity struggle and their socialization aren\u2019t necessarily new.\n\n5. I\u2019d like to thank my parents for shielding me, whether intentionally or (more likely) accidentally, from any of those struggles growing up. Life is hard enough for kids in school; I can\u2019t imagine fighting \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d battles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I actually wonder if anybody knew\u2014in high school, anyway\u2014or thought my mother was white at all until I told them. When my family moved to Alabama, we moved there with my dad and black mother. She was there for everything\u2014my dad was stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., and he\u2019d be there during the week and home on weekends\u2014so I\u2019m guessing nobody thought twice about it. I remember telling a few of my friends in my AP English class once (though I have no idea how it came up) and nobody believing me. Everybody was like, \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen your mama.\u201d\n\nIn college, that same thing happened; nobody knew until I told them. Nothing profound here, but I wonder how different my story would be if I looked more \u201cmixed.\u201d\n\n7. I have talked to my little sister about this: I do sometimes wonder what life would have been like had we been raised by our white mother. Not for a lack of trying, but I think life would have been a lot harder. We weren\u2019t exactly living well when we were with her. I remember struggles and hardship. But also, it would have literally been just us and my white single mother. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have turned out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe I\u2019d be one of those folks who identify as mixed so as not to erase my mother (as I\u2019ve been told that I do). I doubt I\u2019d be as \u201cblack\u201d as I am. I\u2019d most likely have grown up outside of Detroit in smaller, more rural communities. I love my life, so I\u2019m not yearning for any alternatives, but I have thought about an upbringing where the only black music I listened to was Michael Jackson and, oddly, Peaches and Herb. My mother loves \u201cReunited.\u201d\n\n8. Since I wrote that article on my mother back in August, I\u2019ve spent more time being mixed than I ever have in life. Being mixed has been exhausting. I may delve further into that one day, but man, I cannot imagine having spent the entirety of my life attempting to deal with two racial identities and providing active space for them both. I\u2019ve never spent this much time analyzing my family racial dynamics, and it\u2019s, like, a lot. I\u2019m good, b. Wakanda forever and shit.\n\n9. I want to thank Lacey, Anna Holmes and Mehret Mandefro for having me be part of this documentary. It\u2019s kind of cool when what you write gets you asked to be part of a project that can exist for eternity and allow you to revisit yourself in the future to see how you\u2019ve changed (or not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I think the underpinning of all my thoughts on being biracial is how vital the role your parents play in shaping a positive self-image and healthy self-esteem. Your parents\u2019 politics (or lack thereof) are going to be a heavy influence on your own, especially while you\u2019re young. I like to think of myself as pretty grounded, and I know I owe that entirely to my parents and the life they surrounded me with\u2014again, whether entirely intentional or not.", "keywords": ["white", "id", "generation", "black", "mother", "parents", "virginia", "documentary", "kids", "biracial", "im", "episode", "thoughts", "born", "v", "loving", "mixed", "life"], "polarity": 0.09316399835796385, "subjectivity": 0.4276539408866995},

It\u2019s really more of a cackle. Over the phone, her effusiveness travels, just as her character Maxine Shaw\u2019s did through five seasons of Living Single, the prototypical \u201990s sitcom about four black women in Brooklyn. At one point a cultural force\u2014the highest-rated television show among black audiences\u2014the series has had a recent resurgence via streaming on Hulu, where its stories have aged gracefully.\n\nAlexander has since reappeared on shows like Queen Sugar and Bosch, and memorably, a bit role in Get Out. She also makes a living as a writer. Five years ago, she wrote a spec script for Mad Men and posted it on her blog, where she explained, in a post titled \u201cWhy I Wrote a Mad Men Episode With Negroes\u201d: \u201cI was born in the mountains of Arizona, but as a writer I don\u2019t have a hard time imagining black and white on Madison Avenue.\u201d Most recently, she wrote a sci-fi graphic novel titled Concrete Park. And on February 28, the first issue of her Buffy the Vampire Slayer comic book spinoff Giles, will be released as part of a four-issue miniseries, co-written with Buffy creator Joss Whedon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, she and I talked about her foray into comics. We praised Black Panther and went deep into the legend of Maxine and Living Single (and how T.C. Carson, as Kyle Barker, was like the Dean Martin to her Jerry Lewis). She also got passionate about her work as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, being non-religious, and Brooklyn gentrification. Our lightly edited conversation below.\n\nJEZEBEL: Thank you so much for speaking with me. It\u2019s an honor.\n\n\n\nERIKA ALEXANDER: Girl, please. Thank you.\n\nI first have to ask if you\u2019ve seen Black Panther yet because it\u2019s the biggest phenomenon right now, and because you\u2019re into comics, and because your Get Out co-star Daniel Kaluuya is in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is yes, yes and yes. I have seen it, and I loved it.\n\nHad you read the comics before or did you go into it dry?\n\nI certainly hadn\u2019t read the comics, but you\u2019re talking about 50 years of back-reading. It wasn\u2019t gonna happen [laughs]. Not with me. But I had some awareness of it because my ex-husband Tony Puryear was friends with [producer] Reginald Hudlin and all those people. I truly was surprised by what they did on the screen. I was glad to see they stayed true to the nature of [the story] by embracing the flaw in the man [T\u2019Challa] and giving him a really great bad guy, frankly, who stood for every American and lost child of Africa, who stood in for that, and that anger and that rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Killmonger character.\n\nKillmonger, yes. Michael B. Jordan did a really lovely job. And wasn\u2019t he delicious? With all his muscles? And scars.\n\nYes, half the joy of watching the movie was just looking at him. Everyone in it looked gorgeous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh my god. And as a dark-skinned person, it was very satisfying to see all the dark skin, even at the end, when they ended on the little black boy\u2019s face, the dark-skinned brother\u2019s face. They were choosing to say this is unapologetically black. That the love interest can\u2019t be light-skinned and everybody else be dark, like they always do. Those were all great choices. I mean, did you see that and feel that as you were watching?\n\nYeah, definitely, as a dark-skinned woman, I was excited beforehand that the cast featured Lupita and Danai Gurira. It exceeded my expectations as far as the storyline and depth of the plot.\n\nAnd you know Danai writes, right? I\u2019ve seen her play The Convert.\n\nAnd Eclipsed.\n\nI saw The Convert at the Kirk Douglas [Theatre] before Eclipsed. That girl is no joke. To me, she\u2019s getting to startle people about her range. They love her now, but they\u2019re gonna be, I think, astounded by her soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople don\u2019t know that you double as a writer as well. Joss Whedon reached out to you to co-write this graphic novel series based on Buffy but centered around Giles. Can you give me a breakdown of the story and some of the themes you explored?\n\nGiles is\u2014Did you see Buffy the Vampire Slayer?\n\nYeah, I loved it growing up.\n\nOkay, well, I was a person who did not. [Laughs] So if I make mistakes, it\u2019s honest mistakes because we\u2019re doing a totally different thing. I was working. I\u2019ve been head of my household for a very, very long time and frankly when you do TV, you barely watch it. So when [Joss] called me and said, \u201cDo you wanna do it?\u201d I said yes! But then I was like, \u201cOh my god, what is it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Laughs]\n\nI was gratified when he said it\u2019s gonna be Giles the Watcher\u2014who teaches Buffy\u2014now resurrected into a teenage body. There\u2019s a whole mythology in the comic books. He\u2019s gotta go into hiding in an inner-city high school where he meets a black girl vampire who\u2019s 200 years old. Now when [Joss] said \u201cblack girl vampire, 200 years old,\u201d that\u2019s when I was like, I\u2019ll do it! [Laughs] I was gonna do it anyway because it\u2019s Joss Whedon. But I was like, now I see why maybe I\u2019m necessary. Not that I wouldn\u2019t have been necessary before, but I saw that I could put my experiences in it.\n\nAnybody who\u2019s a black girl vampire in America, the people that she mistrusts are humans. They\u2019re the monsters. She\u2019s not the monster to herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wanted to not only talk about, here\u2019s this Watcher that teaches this slayer how to fight for justice, but this vampire who\u2019s seen as his mortal enemy will be teaching him a history about what it is to be human in a whole other way. And I like the vampire, Roux, because Roux\u2019s whole thing is\u2014 I mean anybody who\u2019s a black girl vampire in America, the people that she mistrusts are humans. They\u2019re the monsters. She\u2019s not the monster to herself. So she\u2019s always asking [Giles], \u201cSome monster hunter. Why aren\u2019t you hunting them?\u201d And I love that.\n\n\n\nWhen you say inner city, do you mean black?\n\n\n\nWell, I hate to use that term inner city, but it\u2019s a good way for you to understand that it\u2019s a high school that Giles would never be in. I don\u2019t wanna say inner city. He\u2019s in a city high school, and it\u2019s everything that means. It\u2019s actually a charter school, an academy. I tried to mitigate some of that by making sure they understood there weren\u2019t only black people there. It was just someplace that wasn\u2019t going to be as organized as Sunnydale\u2014\u2019cause [Giles] was brought up in a boarding school in England\u2014for him to bump up against and have conflict with something that he didn\u2019t know anything about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was the most exciting part of the story to develop?\n\nWell, I had to remember through this whole thing, the hero is Giles. After I said, \u201cOh, I know how to write this! Somebody about to get his ass whooped!\u201d [Laughs] And then I realized, no not him. He\u2019s the hero, he\u2019s gonna learn something. He\u2019s gonna get a little ass-kicking, but he\u2019s also gotta do some ass-kicking. It really makes you think about the pathologies that guide us, that are given to us, and what you adopt. You got the hurt and pain of slavery, you got the hurt and pain of poverty, and all these things sort of pressing down on you. And then you got the things you take in that we create around, the anger and rage. To me, the fun part of writing that was asking myself the same questions in a new way and making sure that I service the hero, Giles. For a writer as new as me, that was a little difficult, but I tried my best.\n\nIs there a theme that runs throughout your writing?\n\nThe thing that pops up, now that I\u2019ve written enough, is home. Both my parents were orphans. My father was an itinerant preacher and my mother was a teacher. I used to be obsessed with buying my mother a home. A place we could all be. The hurt and the pain that was there could not be assuaged by anything bought. It had to be something that you can\u2019t buy, that peace. And that was a learning curve. So I think that home keeps popping up. By the way, none of my characters will ever be heroic in that classic way because, like I said, I had an itinerant preacher father. And I loved my father, but he was so damaged. He would tell people what to do and the hypocrisy...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI used to look up to him. You grow up and you go, why are you not doing anything like that? You sitting up here telling stories. And after awhile, you see that everywhere. And people say, you\u2019re not religious? Absolutely not. I\u2019m reformed. I don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s a panacea. I believe people do what they can to get where they need to go, and maybe I didn\u2019t need that much [religion]. I am a spiritual person, that\u2019s how I was raised. But I can let it go in a way that other people can\u2019t. I was always afraid and thinking God\u2019s gonna throw me in hell. I said, I can\u2019t do that. If he\u2019s gonna throw people in hell, he ain\u2019t gonna throw me. I\u2019m sorry. Home [is a theme], but also false identify, false faces, two faces.\n\n\n\nWhat made your dad a hypocrite?\n\nHe was damaged, because he was an abused child. As a pastor, he would advise people on what they should do, but would often do the opposite. Growing up, I looked up to him, but that contradiction was confusing. I soon came to view him as a hypocrite. At the end of his life, while he was fighting for his life, he never apologized or righted wrongs he could have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m curious what he thought of you falling out of religion.\n\nOh, he didn\u2019t think nothing \u2019cause he was dead. He died. But he knew who he was, too. He was aware. His family had fallen apart. He was running a church in East New York and had only six members. And he was dying from congestive heart failure and diabetes. He was fighting for his life, and even inside of all that, never righted the wrongs, never said he was sorry and never accepted it. It\u2019s a shame because he was ordained at the age of six, and they said he was truly a talented healer. I saw him in his prime and then, growing up, I saw him in his decline.\n\nDid you get to buy your mom a home like you wanted to?\n\nI did buy her a home and then when the 2008 crash happened, actually three years before, I lost it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Arizona?\n\nSouth Carolina. By that time, we moved. We were in Arizona and then we moved\u2014\u2019cause he was an itinerant preacher\u2014to upstate New York and then to a seminary in Philadelphia and that\u2019s where I was discovered in a Merchant Ivory [Productions] film called My Little Girl. Then to New York, where they gave him the church. My mother moved to South Carolina after he passed away. And now she lives in upstate New York. She just goes anywhere \u2019cause they were both orphans.\n\nYou talk about not being religious. We don\u2019t see many stories in Hollywood about black people who aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2019Cause we had to be. That\u2019s slavery. You were beat. If somebody tells you this is it and you\u2019re gonna get something in heaven, you\u2019d believe that, too. I\u2019d believe a fairytale. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s just a fairytale. I\u2019m saying you can believe anything somebody told you when you\u2019re in the depths of hell. Malcolm talked about how we wouldn\u2019t have this religion without our oppressors giving it to us so we could be good negroes\u2014good niggas\u2014and work in the field. I believe it takes a certain amount of bravery and courage to throw off some of the things your parents gave you, especially if it\u2019s out of fear. I grew up in the mountains of Arizona, that Southern gothic stuff. It was: hell, damnation, you gon\u2019 die, you better do it, the wages of sin is death. I was full of anxiety, panic, any little thing I did, I\u2019d be like, please! It was too much. [Laughs] I had to let it go. I decided if I\u2019m going to hell, we all going. I really did. \u2019Cause I was a good person and I knew it.\n\nI want to go into the past a bit because there\u2019s been renewed conversation around Living Single now that the episodes are available on Hulu. People who don\u2019t know your backstory may be curious how you landed on the show, how you got that iconic role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, I\u2019d done The Cosby Show, but by that time, I\u2019d been in showbiz almost seven years. I went for an audition and didn\u2019t really think much of it because I was trying to be on a show called M.A.N.T.I.S., which was on Fox. It was a comic book series. And by the way, I\u2019m not the biggest nerd in the world. It seems like I am, but I\u2019m not.\n\nIt seems to be a theme.\n\nNot at all, it\u2019s just the character I was going for was a scientist. I was like, I\u2019m gonna be that scientist! [Laughs] I didn\u2019t know M.A.N.T.I.S. from nothing. I didn\u2019t get the role and I ended up getting Living Single. I did admire [Queen] Latifah and I heard she was in it, but I didn\u2019t really know what that would mean. The [Maxine Shaw] character, I was told later, was not supposed to be a regular. She was supposed to come in every now and then. So I did the pilot and I think from the beginning, you could tell how much the audience was enjoying it, how much they were laughing, how well the chemistry was. That was automatic. At that time, having never done a comedy series from the ground up, I didn\u2019t know that was gonna be automatic. I was like I gotta get back to New York and do some more theater. And they were like, no we picked it up, and we\u2019re off to the races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back, what do you realize was so special about the show in terms of its significance in pop culture? I\u2019m sure at the time you weren\u2019t thinking about all that.\n\nI think we always had a lot of love from the audience, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to pay attention to it. They were looking because we were right behind Martin and also A Different World. I gotta give props to the people who paved the way, not just The Cosby Show, but Different World had tons of really strong women who were in school but they didn\u2019t have careers yet. I always said, I kinda knew what it was gonna be \u2019cause I thought Whitley and those people would [eventually] be where we were [on Living Single]. I think that you know right away whether something\u2019s working with comedy. You may not know with drama, but you know with comedy. Something may be making you cry at home, but it doesn\u2019t touch everybody that way. But comedy is instant. You almost can\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s like a sneeze. And you\u2019re either laughing or you aren\u2019t. And they were always laughing. Always. We were laughing at ourselves. In fact, we didn\u2019t need the audience. We laughed at our own jokes and our own ridiculousness.\n\nCOMEDY IS INSTANT. YOU ALMOST CAN\u2019T STOP IT. IT\u2019S LIKE A SNEEZE. AND YOU\u2019RE EITHER LAUGHING OR YOU AREN\u2019T. AND THEY WERE ALWAYS LAUGHING.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a very beautiful set in terms of the generosity. There was no competition, just always astounded by what we thought was pure genius. You know, the silliness of it all. And yet we were very accessible and down-to-earth in real life. We really were. Everybody that came on our show as guests said, \u201cThis is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d We were so happy because we didn\u2019t have all the big sort of catering that Friends had and the marketing that other shows had. But we did have the fact that we tried to make people feel like they were wanted, that they were necessary, and that we admired them. We had a lot of people who came on who were admirable. Gladys Knight, we had Shaft. We had everybody. Jasmine Guy, Charnele Brown. C.C.H. Pounder. Harold Perrineau. Eartha Kitt. [Ed. Note: Nia Long! TLC! Grant Hill! Naughty by Nature!] Come on now. These are the people, literally they\u2019d come in and we\u2019d bow down to them. Genuflect. And they\u2019d be like, stop, stop. We had the fellas who always would bring them food and say, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Everything was really easygoing, and nobody was there to laugh at you. Nobody thought that they were above it all. We had our issues, but that wasn\u2019t one of them. So I think early on, we knew we had something just because of the chemistry of the set and generosity of spirit.\n\nWhat were the issues you had?\n\nWell, you have issues because we\u2019re six very independently outspoken personalities. I\u2019m telling you, if something happened, you would hear about it. It was really one of those things where we so respected each other that we rarely ever fought between us. When we did, it was about the same silly stuff you might fight about in high school. [Laughs] Just some crap. But really, I\u2019d look at other sets and go, I can\u2019t even really believe they\u2019re dealing with stuff like this \u2019cause we had a Shangri-La. Again, any problems that came on that set [were] from us not doing our jobs as well as we could have and then being pulled up like, okay let\u2019s get it done. But for the most part, we really did work hard. All the time. And come in prepared. There\u2019s times where it could be frustrating after five years. Whatever problems you had after four years in high school, we had the same ones. Sometimes you just want to break out. But they were, to me, nothing compared to [other shows].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine\u2019s character was especially groundbreaking, a black woman lawyer who would qualify as what many people today call unapologetic. I was looking back on old Jet stories about Living Single and a term that was used a lot was \u201cupwardly mobile.\u201d That was a big thing about the show, that it was these black characters who had jobs. What did you think about your character as you were playing her and what do you think of Maxine now?\n\nWhen you first see scripts, they\u2019re lines on a piece of paper. To me, it\u2019s not a character at all. It can be attitude inside of the lines. Cues for you. But you don\u2019t know yet what you don\u2019t know. I was actually doing my best version of my older sister who\u2019s looney as a bat. I\u2019m telling you, Carolyn is very much in Max\u2019s DNA. And only people who know Carolyn go, \u201cOh yes I can see that.\u201d I only graduated from high school. The lawyer I had seen on TV that would\u2019ve been most identifiable to me was Phylicia Rashad and I never thought I could be her. Claire Huxtable. And the person [Maxine] had her hairstyle biting off was Whoopi Goldberg. Because I was coming straight from New York, I just happened to have that hairstyle in my head. A woman from Red Salon had created these new locs and she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna put that in so you can grow your hair out,\u201d from another show I\u2019d just done in Jamaica.\n\nI went around the world, came back, and I asked Ms. Tyson\u2014she was in [The Salon]\u2014I said, I don\u2019t know what to do with my hair and I don\u2019t know what producers want. She said, Don\u2019t ever let anybody tell you what to do to your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I really didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d be. All I knew was I needed to come through that door with energy. They put me in a red-hot suit I think, and it showed legs and I always had long legs. I never thought about what my body looked like. I\u2019m a tomboy. But for people to see a person in that suit, strutting around talking crap, they went crazy. But I was just being me because I grew up around men. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s child, but I\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl. I don\u2019t have no problem shit-talking. I talk so much crap in real life, but I\u2019m shyer than people know. I certainly never did as well as Max did as early. But I knew how to fake the funk. That\u2019s one thing black people know. I was shit-talking and I\u2019ll tell you, it worked. And I was glad they liked it. The rest is all costume, hair, then you get to the words that Yvette Lee [Bowser, the show\u2019s creator and executive producer] wrote.\n\nDid anyone ever ask you to change the hairstyle?\n\n\n\nThey would\u2019ve been wasting their time if they had! Because I had just run into Cicely Tyson, girl. I was in John Atchison\u2019s hair salon in New York and I was just dealing with my\u2014 I\u2019ve had fine hair that was long that grew out as I wore braids. I went around the world, came back, and I asked Ms. Tyson\u2014she was in [the salon]\u2014I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my hair and I don\u2019t know what producers want.\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever let anybody tell you what to do to your hair.\u201d And let me tell you something, when Cicely Tyson tells you what not to do, you remember it. It\u2019s like she put a hex on me. And from that day on, I never thought or cared. If they said something, that probably would\u2019ve been the end of the road for me \u2019cause I would\u2019ve been offended. The truth is I came in the door with that [hair], that\u2019s how we filmed it, and that\u2019s what it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storyline between Max and Kyle was really interesting because it was this love-hate relationship. Why do you think that couple resonated so strongly with people?\n\n\n\nThat happened organically. I think the producers saw that it was real gold when the audience came in. They liked it. But if you notice, in the beginning, I really sparred more with Regine. They would have those biting scenes between Max and Regine, but then Kyle would gang up with Regine and get me. And then they started to tilt it more toward me and Kyle. \u2019Cause it would be a good back-and-forth. And T.C. [Carson] was the first person I met. We auditioned, we were in the same hotel, and he was the first castmember I met, so we were already friends. And it turns out, we were born on the same day, November 19, in real life. So we were meant to be.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to find partners in life. Everybody has a partner in life, if you look at Gene Kelly, who he danced with, Fred Astaire. People have their comedy partners. Famous comedy partners. Jerry Lewis and Martin. [T.C.] was mine. And I stumbled into that relationship not knowing that that would be the case, and was really gratified. Because he couldn\u2019t have loved me more, and I loved him, too. We were good at going back and forth and the audience ate it up and, there you go, that\u2019s all you need. It\u2019s like you\u2019re speaking a language between three. We had us. But we would play off the audience. We needed them in order to build and for them to know about the back and forth, for them to have the expectation and start going, \u201cOhhh, Max getting ready to get\u2026\u201d You know? We needed that. What that brings is huge. You can\u2019t do that without them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you think of the recent slate of reboots like Will & Grace, Rosanne? Is it a good trend or should those shows be left in the past?\n\nI think it\u2019s great that audiences are nostalgic, but I haven\u2019t made any plans to reboot any show I was on, including Living Single.\n\nThere were stories out about how the idea for Friends was basically based on Living Single. Queen Latifah talked about it in an interview. And I read that Yvette cited Waiting to Exhale. She said the success of the book with black women helped Living Single get made. Do you know much about how the idea for the show came about? Had you talked to Yvette about it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I have to say I was more like a hired gun. The thing about me, I\u2019m like a horse with blinders. I\u2019ll just do what\u2019s in front of me sometimes. And it often doesn\u2019t matter where it comes from \u2019cause I\u2019m just like, let me just get in here and do my thang. I heard those things myself and I knew about the whole Friends thing. That did come around later on. John Henton tells a different story where we all knew that we were called My Girls at first and then eventually got to Living Single. One of the execs came down and was walking around with a list of names and one of them was Living Single and one of them was Friends. And they went with Living Single, but Friends was on that list as well. So that\u2019s true. And, you know, Latifah and Kim Coles, the show was built around them, so they have an origin story around their coming together that\u2019s totally different. I have to say I\u2019m kind of grateful \u2019cause I didn\u2019t know what it was gonna be, or if it was going to be. All I knew was that they had hired me to do a gig and I was hoping that, again, that I\u2019d be able to do it and get back to New York. I was happy that didn\u2019t happen, now that I look back.\n\nDo you have a great memory that you walked away with from that show? Obviously, there are a lot.\n\nThere are a lot. It\u2019s hard to say. A lot of people don\u2019t know that Michael Clarke Duncan was our security guard. We called him Bear. I remember Bear came in, he said, \u201cGirl, I got a role. I\u2019m gonna do this thing called Armageddon.\u201d We were like, \u201cReally, bear, what is that?\u201d [Laughs] He told us he was going to do some movie and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, we hope you got a nice part in it.\u201d He goes and does Armageddon, he comes back, and he tells us. We said, \u201cWe went to go see your movie, Bear, and you didn\u2019t get killed. You lasted till the end.\u201d Who knew he\u2019d be The Green Mile and all these other things. You see the sweetness of Bear, you know that\u2019s who was guarding our door, so you know that everyone was welcome. You see Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile, was guarding our door, then you know what kind of hospitality and fortune we were in at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a time where black people were magical and it went away.\n\nIt was a time where black people were magical and it went away. Literally, they segregated TV after the year 2000. They had a few shows, Bernie Mac and Chris Rock, but for the most part it went away until Shonda Rhimes proved, with her excellence, that we were profitable and worth betting on again. That\u2019s shocking. And we rode the end of that wave. I want to tell people, what they should know about the show is we were well aware of being fortunate, but we also thought we belonged, and it was because of all the people that we had seen, from Good Times on. We knew we were standing on the shoulders of those people and, frankly, it\u2019s everything in life to know that. I think it\u2019s like being in an HBCU, like Different World, where you\u2019re aware of your importance but you also know that you got a job to do, you got something to prove. We hope we proved it.\n\nNow there\u2019s a new generation of black creatives making shows like Insecure and Atlanta. The Chi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nHave you gotten to check out any of those shows? And why do you think there was such a decline before?\n\nI\u2019ve seen a couple of those shows and I really love Issa Rae. I really like all the shows. There was a decline because there\u2019s racism. That\u2019s out-and-out racism. It wasn\u2019t \u2019cause [the shows] weren\u2019t profitable. It wasn\u2019t \u2019cause they weren\u2019t making money. We don\u2019t think that exists until we see the ascendance of somebody that\u2019s really radical and extreme as who\u2019s in the White House now. But those forces always existed and they will tamp down excellence of color anywhere they can. Because they have a lie to tell and they can\u2019t tell that lie in the face of a moving image. A moving image is a dreamscape of the world. If you keep showing black people doing well, it\u2019s harder to do First 48, it\u2019s harder to do the cop show and all that other mess. You have to create a space of absence. And so the absence sucked [these shows] out the door. There were many [black] people who made plenty of money, but they weren\u2019t in a position to really make change. And I\u2019m talking about the Wayans Brothers, on. None of them owned a studio. There was no Netflix, there was no streaming, there was nothing, and you were lucky to do some independent films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes this new era of blackness on TV feel like a renaissance to you, having lived through that age in the \u201990s?\n\nNot to me. It feels like somebody finally\u2014The baton was coming over the mountain and through the woods and somebody finally threw it at us and we caught it. We said, this time we not giving it up. There might be some renaissance in the way we\u2019re approaching it. That the pathology is a lot less and that we\u2019re aware of the pathology. So maybe there is a renaissance in the expectation of how we\u2019re supposed to lay it out there. Awkward Black Girl couldn\u2019t get through, but she\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s like somebody threw her the baton from a long way and said, \u201cHere, bitch run!\u201d\n\n[Laughs]\n\n\u201cRun like you\u2019re on fire. And don\u2019t ever give it up.\u201d And guess what, Issa Rae ain\u2019t giving it up. Shonda Rhimes ain\u2019t giving it up. Guess what\u2019s not giving it up? These huge markets that they just realized need to be serviced. There are no more borders. They are now stopped by their awareness of people around them. And I say \u201cthey\u201d because it was a real \u201cthey.\u201d It was a real structure in place. But this time, with all these different YouTubes and everything else, people have their own channels. They have their own CNN. They get up each morning and be like, \u201cHi, this is Terrence Richards in South Carolina.\u201d They do their own reports, y\u2019all. [Laughs] And guess what, good bad or ugly, they\u2019re online. Nobody can keep telling lies in the face of a moving image. They can see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou brought up Trump and it kinda flew under the radar that you served as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nI was her most traveled surrogate. I was with her for nine years.\n\nThere was one campaign stop where you said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go backwards.\u201d What was your feeling on election night, knowing that was basically going to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUm. I ain\u2019t got the words. I\u2019m telling you, I ain\u2019t got the words. You wanna know the truth? I thought that there was something wrong. I always said that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t win. America lost. America lost that night. I knew something was wrong. People started to blame. I said, no I have been on this campaign the whole time for several years. I know what was done in Detroit. Sure people would say, \u201cWell she could\u2019ve done...\u201d But I know what was done. I was there. I was in those small places, the large places. She didn\u2019t run the race they said, and Russia really did matter more than people think. I keep saying, people need to look from precinct to precinct, from polling place to polling place. People think it has to be just tech. You can just pay people off. That sounds crazy and I\u2019ve never been a conspiracy theorist. This is not a conspiracy. Journalists need to go and follow that money. Something went wrong. That\u2019s what I felt.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did know. That Hillary Clinton was a stand-up chick. She would immediately concede if that was the case and that we would move on, because that\u2019s who she is, and she wouldn\u2019t contest it. And that broke my heart, because I wanted her to contest it. I wanted her to fight. But she was right. She\u2019d go, \u201cPeople think democracy is a spectator sport and it\u2019s not.\u201d And now they\u2019re seeing what\u2019s on the other end of their fork. So anybody who thought she was the lesser of two evils, shame on them. She was the best of what was good. And if they can\u2019t recognize decent and good people in front of them, then they deserve people like him up there. That\u2019s what they get. I get hot, but it made me mad because we could\u2019ve gone from one smooth move [to another]. We did it before after Bill Clinton, we could\u2019ve gone to Gore and kept moving with progress and we let some silliness in. But this was even more insidious. So good luck.\n\nAs far as the lesser of two evils, did you find yourself in conversations with women voters who were skeptical? How did you handle the skeptics?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, that\u2019s all I found for her. The funny thing is, people kept trying to qualify it with, \u201cI\u2019m gonna vote for her.\u201d I said, \u201cStop acting like this is the worst thing but you\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d They didn\u2019t even know what they didn\u2019t know. I would tell them things and say, \u201cGo to the website, goddammit!\u201d It\u2019s just ridiculous to be that ignorant in the age of Google. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she did that. Why didn\u2019t she say it?\u201d She did say that! She says it all the time. Are you listening? You\u2019re not. Because you want to believe a lie. And you can\u2019t tell people that are looking for a lie that they can\u2019t find one. You can find one for Obama. He\u2019s from Kenya, this, whatever, and people believe that mess.\n\nThere\u2019s only 13% of us. But can you imagine that we hold up this world that much? How brilliant are we?\n\nI said, let\u2019s get real. This person has been in your space, and I\u2019m talking about healthcare for children, all this stuff was in place, Pell Grants, changed adoption laws, handicap laws. And you don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind that? I said that\u2019s pathetic. And guess what? They let that fool up in there. America always wanna play like it\u2019s The Voice. Or American Idol. \u201cOh, he hit a bad note so that means he\u2019s not good.\u201d You know how many bad notes Prince or Michael Jackson might\u2019ve hit in a competition like that? Well, maybe not Michael. [Laughs] But you get the point, right? They hear the bad note and don\u2019t hear the song. If they can\u2019t hear the good melody and the lyrics, I say fuck \u2019em. I\u2019m angry still \u2019cause we didn\u2019t have to be in this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a lot of people are still angry and trying to direct that anger to be more active.\n\nYes, and I want black women to know, because we tried to hold up the world, because we always trying to hold up the world, that I appreciate that. They need to hold their head up. They knew who she was for the most part. And not everybody can be everything. We argued about the crime bill. We argued about all sorts of stuff. I said, she didn\u2019t sign the crime bill. They were voting for Bernie, who had. Black people showed out. Black women showed out and they showed out in Alabama to stop that pedophile, but we won\u2019t always be there to stop America from destroying itself. We can\u2019t. There\u2019s only 13% of us. But can you imagine that we hold up this world that much? How brilliant are we? Going back to where we started with Black Panther. That\u2019s why we all that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re all that.\n\nYeah, that was another thing I loved about the movie, the importance of every single woman. Going from that to your Get Out role as a police officer. I know Jordan Peele wrote you personally to ask you to be in the movie. What\u2019s your take on how that small character turned out and what feedback did you get?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s so funny, we talked about it after it was put in the can, because I didn\u2019t know really what he saw in me. He said, \u201cErika, you just had a different take.\u201d I had an audition and apparently he wanted me to work the role, but I had so many other guest jobs I was working. Queen Sugar, Bosch and Beyond. He wrote me this gorgeous note that said, \u201cYou brought so much to the role that I didn\u2019t think had that much and you changed my mind on it.\u201d I was reading the note going, \u201cReally?\u201d [Laughs] I said, maybe you gotta show me the audition \u2019cause I don\u2019t know what he talking about. [Laughs] But I came in and did the best I could and Li\u2019l Rel, we had a good time on the set. Jordan couldn\u2019t be nicer, kinder, or more easygoing. And then it becomes a juggernaut cultural hit. People say you can\u2019t know. There\u2019s times you know. Like I said, Living Single, I think we knew that we were gonna be good. On the scale of things, we weren\u2019t as big as the biggest shows but... I had no idea that Get Out was gonna be this way, so I\u2019m really gratified. I had no idea, and he saw it. But it just shows you that the visionary sometimes puts it out there. And then he puts pieces together. You\u2019re not supposed to see all that. You\u2019re supposed to do your piece.\n\nI think people hoped that your character would come back and save the day or something, but I guess that would be putting a lot on the black woman\u2019s shoulder.\n\nOh, I wouldn\u2019t have minded. I think we expect black women to do that. But it was also not just the black woman\u2019s shoulder. That\u2019s where you thought the narrative was going, that she\u2019d come in and be like, \u201chey, stick \u2019em up.\u201d Or whatever. But I love it because everybody has that expectation and maybe this is where Jordan\u2019s smart. Because they see Max. They don\u2019t just see a detective. They think, Oh, Max getting ready to get into this! You know, I\u2019m wearing her face. And then by the end of it, they go, Aw man, she laughed at the black man. Damn. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good that people bring all sorts of baggage from other roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you going to the Oscars? Or will be around it?\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll be around it. How \u2019bout that? [Laughs] I\u2019ma be around it.\n\nYou\u2019re working on a horror project under your company.\n\nYes, Color Farm Media. Myself and Ben Arnon are partners on a new television and tech company called Color Farm Media and one of the things we set up last year was a horror thriller with Lionsgate. Can\u2019t tell you anymore about that, but we\u2019re with them on that. And also a movie about the Boyz Choir of Harlem that we\u2019re going with Tammy Barnes and Paul Barnes, Ava DuVernay\u2019s producing partner. He produced Selma and Queen Sugar. And Electric City, Jamie Patricof\u2019s company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m curious if you got a chance to see Kim Fields on Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\n\n\nYeah, I saw it. [Laughs]\n\nThat season, she was kind of the fish out of water.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what she was. She was like Giles.\n\nIt was funny to see her in that element, knowing her character from Living Single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. You know what. I think she tried something. And I think it\u2019s very hard for somebody, especially like Kim, who grew up in the business. She grew up playing fictional characters. People know her and go, oh that\u2019s Kim Fields, there\u2019s Tutti, there\u2019s Regine. She might\u2019ve thought, well maybe I can hang in a platform like that and make something of it, be comfortable, go toe-to-toe. I don\u2019t know what her thinking was. I give her props for trying. It\u2019s not something I would want to do or think I\u2019d ever do. I can never say never, but for the most part I can\u2019t see myself doing that. I don\u2019t look at it as something that was beneath her. I do think it was something she wasn\u2019t used to. Because we\u2019re not asked as actresses to play parts of ourselves as villains in real life.\n\nThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s just be real. If you have those arguments in front of a camera, you\u2019re not playing Regine. You\u2019re playing yourself. I would never put myself in an argument on camera because I wouldn\u2019t want my mother to see me like that. That\u2019s me. But see, I didn\u2019t come up in that world. My world is very protected by the narrative and the script. I can do anything as Max. Child, I\u2019d rip somebody apart from across the table if they wanted. As Max. But Erika, I wouldn\u2019t do that because who does that make me? And that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s hard to be an actress and then go and say, okay, but I\u2019m playing this role now. Whether they understand it or not, they\u2019re playing roles. They have their own faces on. But those are roles. And I believe she tried something on and then moved on and that was probably the right thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI loved it because her face was always like, what\u2019s going on...?\n\n[Laughs] I think that\u2019s the role she thought she could play. But that role can\u2019t be played on a show like that. You have to engage. You can\u2019t just look on and be a spectator. Nobody wants you looking. They want you to engage and then they want you to participate in a way that undermines or confronts. And if you can\u2019t do that, then you can\u2019t hang.\n\nLast question, one thing about Living Single is that the women were able to afford the brownstones. I live in Brooklyn and was wondering if you thought about how now, obviously, Brooklyn is way more expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI live in Brooklyn, too, partly. I used to live in East New York, which is almost near Brownsville. Still, that\u2019s a place that hasn\u2019t really gotten built up, but I hear that they\u2019ve rezoned it now for high rises. Uh, I don\u2019t know about you, girl, but my mouth dropped when I saw how many people came out of a building that nobody would\u2019ve gone in. There were these white students, women with baby carriages and their lattes. I said, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d There\u2019s a little part of me that was jealous. Because when we were living there, there wasn\u2019t cleanliness, there wasn\u2019t the police presence and if it was, the police presence was shaking and baking folks and stressing us out.\n\nAnd then suddenly, new faces move in that are lighter and suddenly we have all these services and the rent goes up and they\u2019re angry at you and \u201cGet out my way.\u201d Really? Really? That\u2019s really frustrating to see, and I think that\u2019s what hurts black people the most. Like, don\u2019t we get these services? Why can\u2019t we have this expectation? That\u2019s why Black Panther\u2014going back to Wakanda\u2014Wakanda was fabulous. I wish there was a real Wakanda. Girl, I\u2019d have my ticket yesterday. They\u2019d be like, \u201cWhere\u2019s Erika?\u201d I\u2019m in Wakanda, baby. I\u2019m gone. You know how many black people would be on that boat to Wakanda? Or ship, whatever. JetBlue, whatever I need to do to get over there. So yeah, it\u2019s disgusting. And, by the way, Max was the only one out of all of them that could afford her own apartment. So I like to say she was doing the best out of all of them, maybe \u2019cause she was saving money on food.\n\n[Laughs] Right.\n\nEating their food. But you could\u2019ve afforded it back in the day and certainly something like that would\u2019ve been doable then. By the way, I want to say, all the people that come up to me on the street and say they went to law school because of that character. People like Marilyn Mosby who\u2019s over in Baltimore, Maryland. The de Blasios have said that they were inspired by her in politics. I\u2019m not kidding you! And I laughed and [Bill de Blasio] said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t laugh Erika. I\u2019m serious.\u201d I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s the power of the moving image. It moves.

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.\n\nHolmes calls the children of interracial marriage born between 1960 and 1985 \u201cthe Loving Generation,\u201d though where I\u2019m from, we just call us mixed. Or black. Mostly black. Or \u201cYou know you black, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have quite a few qualms about the piece, especially as a mixed person who identifies as black whose picture is included in the actual op-ed\u2014which, petty or not, makes me feel as if I co-signed the opinions and perspective. I did not. All of us who are pictured in the op-ed are also part of a supplement to the documentary series. I can\u2019t speak for anybody else involved, but I took issue with much of the op-ed because our experiences as mixed people are varied in a way that the piece mutes.\n\n1. I HATE the title. \u201cBlack With (Some) White Privilege\u201d conjures up that time Very Smart Brotha\u2019s own Damon Young wrote \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People..\u201d I got why folks hated that title then (even if I agreed in principle with his argument), and I hate this even more. Damon\u2019s piece stated that male privilege exists and that black males have some privilege by virtue of being male. THIS piece alleges that mixed kids exercise some sort of white privilege by virtue of having a white parent. I think this entire premise is flawed; it is ENTIRELY circumstantial. She\u2019s somehow conflating colorism with proximity to whiteness, and they\u2019re two entirely different things.\n\nYou can be light-skinned with two black parents and receive the same benefits from lightness as a person who is mixed. And what if you\u2019re a dark-skinned mixed person\u2014somebody whose background is entirely impossible to tell from skin tone\u2014and receive no \u201cbenefits\u201d? Then what? Do you still have some white privilege because of your white parent? Like, do they need to show up to prove it? Maybe you just can\u2019t use it in person, only on paper?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I don\u2019t like this idea that there was some overarching political decision that so many black-and-white couples made after the Supreme Court decision to somehow stick it (no pun intended) to white supremacy by creating mixed children. While I\u2019m sure that some white folks absolutely rebelled in the form of their bedroom decisions, and some black folks took that opportunity, do we really believe that people are thinking about a Supreme Court decision when they meet and go through life together? I doubt it. If there\u2019s any proximity argument, I think this is where it exists. Most of these relationships\u2014whether married or not\u2014were born of desire, love and actual proximity.\n\n3. This passage:\n\nHow does having one white parent change that \u201ctwice as good\u201d calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how you have an idea, then you find ideas to support it even if holes can be shot through it? So there are more mixed people than you\u2019d expect in the \u201cleaders and luminaries\u201d category. OK. Holmes points out several at the beginning of the piece, namely actors, politicos, entertainers, athletes, etc.\n\nFor some, in particular entertainers and politicos, it would be asinine to suggest that their skin tone\u2014folks like Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Halle Berry\u2014doesn\u2019t play a role in their success; their being mixed also contributed to their skin tone, of course. Carey may be an outlier because of her once-in-a-lifetime talent (the same with Derek Jeter and Jason Kidd, also name-checked in the article). But proximity to whiteness didn\u2019t help them out as much as their complexion. And how do you reconcile that with folks like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna (and, hell, Muhammad Ali) who are (or was) light-skinned with two black parents? Are they just otherworldly talents? What about their white proximity?\n\n4. Then this passage:\n\nSometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not proximity, it\u2019s access to white people that begets other access to white people and the white power structure. I\u2019m connected to white people, so other white folks can tell and thus make an easier pathway toward success. Which, again, works if you can tell that a person is mixed and thus make a conscious decision because of it.\n\nWhat about the rest of us who aren\u2019t that easily discernible as mixed? What about our success? Not all heroes wear capes, and not all mixed people look like Meghan Markle. Or Vanessa Williams. Some of us actually aren\u2019t that noticeable and are considered light-skinned black folks by society writ large until we show up with or tell you we have a white parent. Doors don\u2019t open at that point either, by the way.\n\n5. And this:\n\nIt\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree that President Barack Obama\u2019s proximity to whiteness absolutely helped shape his worldview, and being around white people who loved him unequivocally was a boon for him. Did that make him believe he could be the first black president? Eh. My black parents made me believe that I could, too. But being president seems like a terrible job, so I\u2019ve never had the smallest of inklings to want to go down that road. Now, I suppose the question is, did I actually think that I could? Whereas maybe Obama always believed it with his whole heart? That\u2019s a legit question.\n\n6. Holy mother of God:\n\nI knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness \u2014 and my own perception and self-consciousness of it \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the foreground. What I didn\u2019t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I\u2019d accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m mixed\u2014my mother is a white woman\u2014and I have never moved around white people with relative ease, though I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means, either. In fact, short of my white mother, grandmother and stepfather, I am rarely around whiteness. I live in predominantly black cities and went to an HBCU and could literally put \u201cprofessional black person\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without a hint of comedy. I think most folks would call me successful, so how would we qualify that success? And what about dark-skinned black people who move with ease around white people?\n\n7. For heaven\u2019s sake:\n\nTurns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. \u201cAt my job, there\u2019s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, is that because there\u2019s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting promotions and why we\u2019re moving forward?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can\u2019t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love my mother, who is white. We do nothing but argue and have nothing in common. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m just an exception to this whole mixed life that others manage to live.\n\n8. Yep:\n\nThe writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told \u201cThe Loving Generation\u201d director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. \u201cOur ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,\u201d she said. She wonders, however, what the return is \u2014 that is, where do we go from here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed-race fluidity? What is that? Is that a thing? (It\u2019s not.) I\u2019m mixed and I view life through a very, very black-perspective lens. Because that\u2019s my life; I\u2019m black. How do you even see things with a white perspective? What is that? I\u2019m REALLY asking. \u201cMixed-race fluidity\u201d implies that you have some choices and can move easily between worlds. I don\u2019t care to do that, but in my experiences, that\u2019s not a thing. Being mixed just means that you don\u2019t choose black, not that you are somehow white. Because that\u2019s not a choice you actually have outside of the confines of your own mind and friends who let you cook.\n\n9. It goes on, but that\u2019s my larger issue with this piece: You can\u2019t decide that colorism isn\u2019t at the heart of whatever \u201cprivilege\u201d is being attributed to whiteness. Mixed people come in so many different shades that you can\u2019t always tell. Sure, some mixed folks are lighter and thus, perhaps, benefit in ways that other mixed folks may not, but that\u2019s not because they\u2019re mixed; it\u2019s because they\u2019re light-skinned.\n\nWhat about me? I\u2019m light-skinned, but I seriously doubt that there\u2019s some significant benefit I\u2019ve received, even though I\u2019d wager that I have received some by virtue of my less-than-threatening visage. Saying that black folks receive white privilege is problematic because it entirely DISCOUNTS light-skinned points, something we joke about in the black community that is a real thing. You don\u2019t need to be half-white for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The most I\u2019ve ever discussed being \u201cmixed\u201d has been over the past six months. My life has been a largely black one since I was a child. I was raised in a black household, with some summers spent with my white mom in quasi-rural Michigan, where I was always aware of my blackness. Articles such as this push me further into the belief that my parents really did me a solid by not giving me a choice or considering me to be mixed in order to make sure I honored both of my parents. I am able to do so without trying to claim some racial connection that white people have spent centuries trying to remove from me.\n\nPlus, why would I want that? I can love my white mother and be black. But more important, to me, it\u2019s REALLY OK to be black. I don\u2019t need to focus on the white proximity or the adjacency or the gaze. I can be equally successful as a black person who fully embraces that part of myself. There\u2019s a reason I never think about whether my being mixed is partially responsible for my success\u2014I don\u2019t make it a thing. I don\u2019t allow others to focus on it. It\u2019s why I not only get to go to the cookout, but I can also bring macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can acknowledge that I receive some benefits because I\u2019m light-skinned\u2014because I am. I also have the wherewithal to acknowledge that my black parents (and sometimes, ironically, my white mother) raised a black man who is comfortable with his accomplishments, without also feeling as if the whiteness in my veins that nobody knows exists is the reason for those accomplishments. That\u2019s my beef with the piece and its centering so much whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause it really is OK to black.", "keywords": ["york", "white", "oped", "anna", "times", "im", "thats", "dont", "proximity", "thoughts", "holmes", "privilege", "folks", "whiteness", "black", "mixed"], "polarity": 0.08471439626681555, "subjectivity": 0.38245688451333604},

Full disclosure: I\u2019m in the documentary. It explores the stories of biracial black-and-white children born after the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which outlawed the ban on interracial marriage in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve watched all of the episodes intently and with a lot of curiosity. It was very well produced, and I believe it touched on many interesting facets of the \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d experience that I\u2019d never thought about. One could say that it was provocative and got the people going. I had some thoughts.\n\n1. Last November, I received a message from Lacey Schwartz about including me in a digital documentary on black-white biracial children. For the vast majority of my adult life\u2014and hell, even my youth\u2014I didn\u2019t spend much time talking about or \u201cbeing\u201d biracial. Yeah, I\u2019m mixed, but, well, nobody cared. At least in my life, anyway. So going into the filming of my interview, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but I enjoyed the experience.\n\n2. Regarding the documentary itself, I enjoyed it as a whole. The producers did a good job bringing various types of folks together, each telling a diverse story about what it\u2019s like being biracial in America. There were different viewpoints\u2014many of us consider ourselves black with white parents, while others view themselves as mixed or biracial, and we all have our reasons for those decisions. The presentation of perspectives was well-done.\n\n\n\n3. On a personal level, I not only root for everybody black\u2014I typically just assign everybody who \u201clooks mixed\u201d to the black community until they tell me otherwise. It\u2019s just easier for my own life, and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. Do you, boo, of course. Live your life, and this above all: To thine own self be true. But I did learn something from those whose decision isn\u2019t so black and white. Pun intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I\u2019m not a unicorn, of course, but I have normalized my own existence for my sanity, and it turns out it\u2019s not normal at all. Though I\u2019m mixed, I was not raised that way and largely wasn\u2019t raised by my white mother. I was raised by a black woman, and I can\u2019t overstate the importance of that fact for how it influenced my sense of self. The entire third episode, \u201cComing of Age,\u201d is about growing up mixed, and, well, I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m not in that episode at all (there are other folks who aren\u2019t, too), and it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have any of those difficult self-identity episodes or struggles. White people were the feds. I stayed on the black-hand side with my people and nobody ever questioned it. It\u2019s interesting, though. The stories of people who did have to contend with that identity struggle and their socialization aren\u2019t necessarily new.\n\n5. I\u2019d like to thank my parents for shielding me, whether intentionally or (more likely) accidentally, from any of those struggles growing up. Life is hard enough for kids in school; I can\u2019t imagine fighting \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d battles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I actually wonder if anybody knew\u2014in high school, anyway\u2014or thought my mother was white at all until I told them. When my family moved to Alabama, we moved there with my dad and black mother. She was there for everything\u2014my dad was stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., and he\u2019d be there during the week and home on weekends\u2014so I\u2019m guessing nobody thought twice about it. I remember telling a few of my friends in my AP English class once (though I have no idea how it came up) and nobody believing me. Everybody was like, \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen your mama.\u201d\n\nIn college, that same thing happened; nobody knew until I told them. Nothing profound here, but I wonder how different my story would be if I looked more \u201cmixed.\u201d\n\n7. I have talked to my little sister about this: I do sometimes wonder what life would have been like had we been raised by our white mother. Not for a lack of trying, but I think life would have been a lot harder. We weren\u2019t exactly living well when we were with her. I remember struggles and hardship. But also, it would have literally been just us and my white single mother. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have turned out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe I\u2019d be one of those folks who identify as mixed so as not to erase my mother (as I\u2019ve been told that I do). I doubt I\u2019d be as \u201cblack\u201d as I am. I\u2019d most likely have grown up outside of Detroit in smaller, more rural communities. I love my life, so I\u2019m not yearning for any alternatives, but I have thought about an upbringing where the only black music I listened to was Michael Jackson and, oddly, Peaches and Herb. My mother loves \u201cReunited.\u201d\n\n8. Since I wrote that article on my mother back in August, I\u2019ve spent more time being mixed than I ever have in life. Being mixed has been exhausting. I may delve further into that one day, but man, I cannot imagine having spent the entirety of my life attempting to deal with two racial identities and providing active space for them both. I\u2019ve never spent this much time analyzing my family racial dynamics, and it\u2019s, like, a lot. I\u2019m good, b. Wakanda forever and shit.\n\n9. I want to thank Lacey, Anna Holmes and Mehret Mandefro for having me be part of this documentary. It\u2019s kind of cool when what you write gets you asked to be part of a project that can exist for eternity and allow you to revisit yourself in the future to see how you\u2019ve changed (or not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I think the underpinning of all my thoughts on being biracial is how vital the role your parents play in shaping a positive self-image and healthy self-esteem.

My 5-year-old nephew has apparently reached the age where bald curiosity meets peak candor, because he\u2019s taken to asking me this question every time we see each other, as we did a few days ago. My response is always the same: \u201cHoney, why do you want me to be married?\u201d\n\nMore than once he\u2019s said shyly, while hanging off my neck, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d\n\nOuch. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not alone. I have you, and your sister, and Mommy and Daddy, and Grammy and Papa ... \u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think you should get married,\u201d he earnestly insists.\n\nOK, enough philosophy; time to get real with this kid: \u201cWell, what would I need to be married?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, he always screws up his adorable little face, as if I\u2019ve asked him the meaning of life ... or whether he\u2019s brushed his teeth yet.\n\n\u201cHmm ... a husband?\u201d\n\nEnd of discussion, thank God.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day can be an embarrassment of riches rich with embarrassment for single people, whether it\u2019s a 5-year-old deeply concerned about you dying alone, or a well-meaning, happily married colleague who suggests that you do a story on the statistical undesirability of black, single women in online dating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd no matter how much one\u2019s version of alone differs from lonely, if I\u2019m honest, it always stings, at least a little.\n\nBut then I think back to last Valentine\u2019s Day, when I was a freelance creative trying to figure out my next big chess move. Only a week before, I\u2019d moved back to my hometown after a 24-year absence\u2014in part because the man I\u2019d long been dating long-distance lived there.\n\nBut instead of feeling at home, I was sad, scared, set adrift, waiting for a sign, and starting to have the growing suspicion that my \u201cboyfriend\u201d liked me much better when we weren\u2019t in the same area code. That suspicion would prove true months later, when an out-of-town friend spotted him on Tinder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, I was lonely\u2014far lonelier than I am now, when I\u2019m basically married to my job (a concept I thought a bit too advanced for my nephew). But somewhere between trying to meet a man halfway and getting The Glow Up up and running, I went missing.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it was my constant attempts to be accommodating, the constant grind of trying to learn on my feet, or just the constant pressure to be all things all the time and never quite feeling that I was measuring up, but I allowed myself to get lost in the mix. I checked out, and I must admit, checking back in is harder than I thought.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone; every day I engage with the incredible growing community in The Glow Up Facebook group, and see myself reflected in the women there, all of us trying to stay present and connected\u2014even when we\u2019re not quite sure what to connect ourselves to anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve realized, as many of us do, that love is a choice; a choice we must make over and over again\u2014sometimes in spite of everything else. But all too often, our concept of love remains fixed to factors that we have very little choice in at all, like waiting to get \u201cchose\u201d or finding someone \u201cworthy\u201d of choosing.\n\nWhy do we do that? Is it because it\u2019s easier to throw our fates to the wind than to choose ourselves, even if no one else does?\n\nI can\u2019t currently claim loneliness; my life is too full of deadlines, and meetings, and personalities, and way too much stuff. I also don\u2019t think about marriage much these days\u2014there are lots of reasons I\u2019m not married, and some of them are entirely on me. And, thankfully, I can say without bitterness that I don\u2019t even miss my ex. When I think back on him and the men who preceded him, I feel no regret. (I don\u2019t feel much of anything, to be honest.) There is no \u201cone who got away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also know firsthand what a difference a year can make.\n\nBut damn if I don\u2019t miss myself. I gotta find that woman.

The distinction informs my worldview and why I identify as a black man and why my life has unfolded the way it has.\n\nI use the term \u201cstep\u201d when explaining that my father remarried, because it\u2019s the language most folks are familiar with, but it actually annoys me every single time I have to say the word \u201cstepmother.\u201d Or when I\u2019m talking about my sisters, and for informative and explanative purposes, I have to use the term \u201cstepsisters\u201d or \u201chalf brother and sister,\u201d where appropriate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn almost every single conversation I\u2019ve had, and often well after they\u2019ve concluded, I\u2019ve contemplated how else I might discuss the blending of my family and how we operate without using terms that are understandable but feel so removed from my own life.\n\nMy stepmother? Is my mama. Period. When I\u2019m around either of my mothers, I refer to them both as \u201cMama.\u201d And I don\u2019t have stepsisters; I just have sisters. Always have. Always will.\n\nMy little sister and I moved from Michigan when I was 6 and she was 3 to live in Frankfurt, Germany, with my father and his then girlfriend. They got married a few years later. I don\u2019t know when I started calling her \u201cMama.\u201d I do know that nobody told me I had to; it\u2019s just something I started doing naturally after comfort and familiarity set in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess in my young mind, this woman with whom I was living and who was taking care of me was doing what mothers did, so she was my mother. I didn\u2019t feel like that took away from my \u201creal mother,\u201d but I\u2019m also not sure that, at 6, 7 or 8 years old, I had any real ability to understand what those terms could mean to the adults around me.\n\nI\u2019ve never asked my white mother what she felt about my calling my \u201cstepmother\u201d \u201cMama\u201d; nor have I ever asked my \u201cstepmother\u201d what she felt when I first started calling her \u201cMama.\u201d\n\nI do know that my real mother has nothing but respect for the job that was done raising her kids. My two mothers get along just fine. Or, at least, all I\u2019ve seen is them get along fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom age 6 to today, in my life, I\u2019ve had two mothers. Both holding spaces in my life, but my mama (in Alabama\u2014as my sister and I sometimes say when discussing them both) has been there in every way a mother could be: school plays, basketball games, track meets, parent meetings, surgeries, rough days, good days, etc.\n\nBecause we lived overseas, and then 700 miles away (once we returned to the States), it was impossible for my mama (in Michigan) to be present daily except for the summer months when we\u2019d visit. I had my mama for that. She loved me and continues to love me like a mother is supposed to\u2014I can call her for counsel, love, help, no reason at all, or to find out what\u2019s happening in the family, though my family has this REMARKABLE tendency to forget to tell me things.\n\nOf all my extended family\u2014in Alabama (dad), Michigan (birth mom) and Georgia (stepmom)\u2014I\u2019m actually closest to my stepmother\u2019s family. It\u2019s to her family reunions that we go annually. It\u2019s with that family that I am the most connected. We\u2019re all black, so making the cousin leap isn\u2019t hard, but still. My younger sister and I were embraced by that family wholeheartedly, and the love is real. There\u2019s no \u201cstep\u201d anywhere in our lives for that reason. And it\u2019s the same with my siblings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have two stepsisters, but we were raised as regular siblings. There was never any difference for us, though I suppose you can raise four kids differently in the same house, step or not. We treat one another as one, we love one another as one, we are one big family that loves and supports one another. Our kids have never learned anything about \u201cstep\u201d anything.\n\nIn fact, we spent years confusing one of my nephews by telling him that his mother and I were actually twins (we\u2019re actually about three months apart\u2014we\u2019d just pick one or the other\u2019s birthday to celebrate), which confused him because he knows we have other parents. He\u2019s 18 now. The jig is up.\n\nTo make it even more confusing, my stepsisters have both a half brother and sister, whom I treat as and call my younger brother and sister. They\u2019re not blood, or even step to me, but they\u2019re my siblings all the same. We have family pictures with all of us kids in them, and you can\u2019t tell that we\u2019re not related at all. I talk to them and we visit one another; we\u2019re family. We look like a collection of siblings because that\u2019s what we are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are no prefixes on who we are as a family, but when telling my family story, I have to explain it in terms that allow folks to distinguish. And I get it\u2014it is easier to express these relationships in those terms when I\u2019m discussing my background or how I was raised, but as I said, every single time I say \u201cstep\u201d or \u201chalf,\u201d it feels wrong, as if I\u2019m devaluing my family.\n\nI realize that nobody in my family is concerned about it\u2014we\u2019re close enough that nobody listening to me or reading would think twice about my use of the terms \u201cstep\u201d or \u201chalf.\u201d But for me, having been raised by a black woman who happens to be one of the most giving people I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing, who also decided to be my mother and allowed me to be her son and raised me up to be the best person I can be, I cringe a little when I say it.\n\nI know there\u2019s nothing wrong with stepparents or stepsiblings. And it\u2019s just a word; but in my life, those words aren\u2019t things\u2014they don\u2019t exist and almost never did until I had to explain my family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it much ado about nothing?

Virginia Supreme Court decision, which outlawed the ban on interracial marriage in the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve watched all of the episodes intently and with a lot of curiosity. It was very well produced, and I believe it touched on many interesting facets of the \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d experience that I\u2019d never thought about. One could say that it was provocative and got the people going. I had some thoughts.\n\n1. Last November, I received a message from Lacey Schwartz about including me in a digital documentary on black-white biracial children. For the vast majority of my adult life\u2014and hell, even my youth\u2014I didn\u2019t spend much time talking about or \u201cbeing\u201d biracial. Yeah, I\u2019m mixed, but, well, nobody cared. At least in my life, anyway. So going into the filming of my interview, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but I enjoyed the experience.\n\n2. Regarding the documentary itself, I enjoyed it as a whole. The producers did a good job bringing various types of folks together, each telling a diverse story about what it\u2019s like being biracial in America. There were different viewpoints\u2014many of us consider ourselves black with white parents, while others view themselves as mixed or biracial, and we all have our reasons for those decisions. The presentation of perspectives was well-done.\n\n\n\n3. On a personal level, I not only root for everybody black\u2014I typically just assign everybody who \u201clooks mixed\u201d to the black community until they tell me otherwise. It\u2019s just easier for my own life, and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. Do you, boo, of course. Live your life, and this above all: To thine own self be true. But I did learn something from those whose decision isn\u2019t so black and white. Pun intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I\u2019m not a unicorn, of course, but I have normalized my own existence for my sanity, and it turns out it\u2019s not normal at all. Though I\u2019m mixed, I was not raised that way and largely wasn\u2019t raised by my white mother. I was raised by a black woman, and I can\u2019t overstate the importance of that fact for how it influenced my sense of self. The entire third episode, \u201cComing of Age,\u201d is about growing up mixed, and, well, I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m not in that episode at all (there are other folks who aren\u2019t, too), and it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have any of those difficult self-identity episodes or struggles. White people were the feds. I stayed on the black-hand side with my people and nobody ever questioned it. It\u2019s interesting, though. The stories of people who did have to contend with that identity struggle and their socialization aren\u2019t necessarily new.\n\n5. I\u2019d like to thank my parents for shielding me, whether intentionally or (more likely) accidentally, from any of those struggles growing up. Life is hard enough for kids in school; I can\u2019t imagine fighting \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d battles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I actually wonder if anybody knew\u2014in high school, anyway\u2014or thought my mother was white at all until I told them. When my family moved to Alabama, we moved there with my dad and black mother. She was there for everything\u2014my dad was stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., and he\u2019d be there during the week and home on weekends\u2014so I\u2019m guessing nobody thought twice about it. I remember telling a few of my friends in my AP English class once (though I have no idea how it came up) and nobody believing me. Everybody was like, \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen your mama.\u201d\n\nIn college, that same thing happened; nobody knew until I told them. Nothing profound here, but I wonder how different my story would be if I looked more \u201cmixed.\u201d\n\n7. I have talked to my little sister about this: I do sometimes wonder what life would have been like had we been raised by our white mother. Not for a lack of trying, but I think life would have been a lot harder. We weren\u2019t exactly living well when we were with her. I remember struggles and hardship. But also, it would have literally been just us and my white single mother. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have turned out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe I\u2019d be one of those folks who identify as mixed so as not to erase my mother (as I\u2019ve been told that I do). I doubt I\u2019d be as \u201cblack\u201d as I am. I\u2019d most likely have grown up outside of Detroit in smaller, more rural communities. I love my life, so I\u2019m not yearning for any alternatives, but I have thought about an upbringing where the only black music I listened to was Michael Jackson and, oddly, Peaches and Herb. My mother loves \u201cReunited.\u201d\n\n8. Since I wrote that article on my mother back in August, I\u2019ve spent more time being mixed than I ever have in life. Being mixed has been exhausting. I may delve further into that one day, but man, I cannot imagine having spent the entirety of my life attempting to deal with two racial identities and providing active space for them both. I\u2019ve never spent this much time analyzing my family racial dynamics, and it\u2019s, like, a lot. I\u2019m good, b. Wakanda forever and shit.\n\n9. I want to thank Lacey, Anna Holmes and Mehret Mandefro for having me be part of this documentary. It\u2019s kind of cool when what you write gets you asked to be part of a project that can exist for eternity and allow you to revisit yourself in the future to see how you\u2019ve changed (or not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I think the underpinning of all my thoughts on being biracial is how vital the role your parents play in shaping a positive self-image and healthy self-esteem. Your parents\u2019 politics (or lack thereof) are going to be a heavy influence on your own, especially while you\u2019re young. I like to think of myself as pretty grounded, and I know I owe that entirely to my parents and the life they surrounded me with\u2014again, whether entirely intentional or not.", "keywords": ["white", "id", "generation", "black", "mother", "parents", "virginia", "documentary", "kids", "biracial", "im", "episode", "thoughts", "born", "v", "loving", "mixed", "life"], "polarity": 0.09316399835796385, "subjectivity": 0.4276539408866995},

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ... Never feeling like that must be the ultimate privilege.\n\nBut then again, I am a black man ...\n\nAn apology.", "keywords": ["white", "black", "weapon", "david", "sweet", "love", "gun", "article", "french", "safe", "man", "atlantic", "privilege", "feel", "sentient", "carry", "culture"], "polarity": 0.06059433621933622, "subjectivity": 0.4263154761904762},

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["90s", "id", "butch", "felt", "love", "jones", "living", "wanted", "women", "latifah", "style", "hiphop", "single", "shaped", "way"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

As we all know, Ellison would be proved correct.\n\nNow the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee has a bold new prediction: The political left will take back Congress in 2018.\n\nIn a new interview published by The Atlantic on Monday, Ellison unpacks last week\u2019s Democratic election victories and gives his take on the Democrats\u2019 chances at the ballot next year.\n\nEllison told the outlet that he was encouraged by Democrats\u2019 gains in Virginia, calling it a sign of \u201cgood things to come.\u201d He also told interviewer Clare Foran that the Democrats needed to adopt an agenda that addressed economic concerns in order for them to win the seats necessary to take back the House and Senate:\n\nEllison: There is more income and wealth inequality in this country than since the Great Depression. What some folks would label or call progressive is just responding to the economic realities of literally millions of Americans. Sixty-three percent of Americans don\u2019t know what they\u2019d do if they had an unexpected $500 bill. So is it progressive to say they should be able to handle that bill? I don\u2019t know, call it whatever you want, I call it responsive government. Foran: Well, regardless of labels, do you think more Democrats are getting the message that they need to address those kinds of concerns? Ellison: Yes. My opinion is that any Democrat who is not responsive to the economic challenges of working Americans will not be able to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Minnesota representative also spoke at length about the Alabama special-election race and his thoughts on candidate Roy Moore\u2014although the conversation took place before news broke of Moore\u2019s alleged abuse of a 14-year-old girl:\n\nForan: How are you feeling about the Alabama special election race? Do you think Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, has a shot? Could he win even in a deeply red state? Ellison: Alabama is a blue state in the making. It\u2019s full of folks who want a better life, who want higher pay. I think Roy Moore is, he\u2019s a perfect villain, he\u2019s a gun-toting racist, law-violating theocratic person. And Doug Jones is a civil-rights hero. If we don\u2019t win, it means only one thing, we have not gone to the grassroots and mobilized the people enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, Ellison highlighted the differences between the DNC in 2016 versus 2017. The DNC has been embroiled in controversy over its management and allegations that the party rigged the primaries in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nEllison didn\u2019t address Clinton specifically but, rather, the DNC\u2019s outreach strategy:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, I\u2019d say 90 percent of the money was spent in about 15 battleground states. We bought into this highly minimalist campaign strategy, which essentially said we\u2019re only going to target the number of votes we need to win, and we\u2019re going to use TV and data analytics to do it. We\u2019re completely reversing that model, and saying first of all we\u2019re not in it just to win the election. We\u2019re in it to win community. If we make people feel that we\u2019ve got their back, and their party is there for them, the election becomes the easy part. If you look at the mission statement of the DNC prior to now, it would say our goal is to elect the president. Now our goal has changed. Our goal is to elect Democrats from dog-catcher to president and everywhere in between, and our primary tool is grassroots engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at The Atlantic.", "keywords": ["president", "ellison", "better", "trumps", "keith", "man", "coming", "think", "state", "democrats", "predictions", "say", "told", "bold", "win", "saw", "presidency", "election"], "polarity": 0.30343552622241154, "subjectivity": 0.4397551628699167},

She reassured me that, yes, marriage was possible for me.\n\n\n\nThat conversation taught me that there are some topics you can\u2019t discuss with everyone. As a woman, you\u2019re supposed to want marriage and kids. And if you don\u2019t, people are prone to try to convince you that you\u2019ll change your mind or that you\u2019re just saying what you\u2019re saying because you\u2019re single; once you meet the right person, you\u2019ll get out the bridal magazines and get ready for those babies.\n\nBut almost a decade later, I\u2019m still making the same statement I made to my friend\u2019s mother at 22. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m anti-marriage; but on my long list of life goals, it\u2019s not even on the list. If it happens, I\u2019ll be happy. But if I never make it to the altar, I won\u2019t shed any tears.\n\nDuring my early 20, I had a very close relationship with one of my college professors. Her romantic life was my inspiration for love\u2014this was long before the hashtag #RelationshipGoals became a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember one day, her then-boyfriend came over unannounced\u2014and without her asking\u2014to pressure-wash her house. I repeat, HE CAME OVER TO PRESSURE-WASH HER HOUSE. I knew then that I\u2019d witnessed true love.\n\nMy professor had been with her partner for over a decade, owned her home and was working on getting her Ph.D. People were always asking her why she wouldn\u2019t just marry her boyfriend already. \u201cI would\u2019ve been a terrible wife if I\u2019d married him earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to wait until I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nWell, doesn\u2019t that sound reasonable, I thought. I decided that I, too, would wait until I\u2019d gotten my life together before getting married. Almost a decade later, I still haven\u2019t gotten my life together\u2014but I\u2019m confident that it\u2019ll happen someday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years passed, and my professor got her Ph.D., married her boo and had a baby. I confided in her that I admired her relationship trajectory and told her I was also going to wait until later in life to get married. She was aghast.\n\n\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t follow what I did!\u201d she said. \u201cDo what\u2019s right for you.\u201d\n\nShe tried to reject being my #RelationshipGoals, but it was too late. She\u2019d already inspired me. (You can\u2019t reject my admiration!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I turned 30, my thoughts on marriage didn\u2019t change, but it suddenly seemed like everyone my age was getting married and having kids. My Facebook feed morphed from posts about general shenanigans to posts about engagements, anniversaries and babies. Was this something I was supposed to be doing? Was I failing at life? Had I missed the boat?\n\nI mean, I suppose I could\u2019ve just found some random guy and gotten married the next day. But do you know what\u2019s way worse than being single? Being in a horrible marriage with someone you hate, and having to see that person every day for the rest of your life. Who wants that kind of negativity? Not me.\n\nWitnessing the dissolution of my parents\u2019 relationship stripped away any idealization of marriage for me. Marriage is hard. Really hard. Divorce is even harder. And I\u2019m too lazy to be spending energy on a marriage with someone I\u2019m only with because society says I need to be married to have a purpose in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are other reasons marriage may not be in the cards for me: I like to move. A lot. I may move tomorrow. Who knows? Marriage would be the death of all that. I also love living alone. I don\u2019t ever want to shack up with a boyfriend\u2014but I\u2019m sure that any potential husband would likely want us to move in together. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s part of the whole marriage deal.\n\nSometimes\u2014OK, all the time\u2014I\u2019m envious of couples with the double-income life. I look at my financial struggles and fantasize that if I were married, there would be someone to help shoulder the costs of the bills, plan trips, run errands and take care of things if I got sick\u2014or, God forbid, broke a hip.\n\nBut then I remember what I\u2019d be giving up for all of that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live alone. I wouldn\u2019t be able to move whenever I got the urge. I couldn\u2019t make a midnight run to the grocery store for a pint of ice cream. OK, I could probably still do that, but I\u2019d have to tell the hubby I was leaving and wait to see if he wanted to come along. Who has time for all that when you\u2019re jonesing for an ice cream fix?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her speech at Glamour\u2019s 2017 Women of the Year Summit, actress Tracee Ellis Ross talked about being 45 and single without kids. She said:\n\nMy worth gets diminished as I am reminded that I have \u201cfailed\u201d on the marriage and carriage counts. ... Those two #goals: being chosen and having kids, are what makes you worthy. ... I am trying to gather all this energy around me, step into it, and match it with my realization that my life is mine. ... It means risking being misunderstood, perceived as alone and broken, having no one to focus on, fall into or hide behind, having to be my own support and having to stretch and find family love and connection outside of the traditional places. But I want to do it. I want to be the brave me, the real me, the one whose life is my own.\n\nHearing Ross speak so frankly about being single was refreshing. So often\u2014too often\u2014people don\u2019t talk publicly about being single. Singlehood is something you\u2019re supposed to be ashamed about; something you\u2019re supposed to be trying your hardest to fix. And if you\u2019re a woman, no one believes you if you say you\u2019re happy without a husband or kids. It seems everyone is convinced that you\u2019re crying yourself to sleep at night, waiting for your real life to begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the right person comes along, I\u2019ll be more than happy to tie the knot. But that being said, I\u2019ve gotten to know myself pretty well over the years. I may never get married. But if I do, it won\u2019t be until I meet someone who voluntarily comes over to pressure-wash my house.*\n\n*I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to afford a house, so this scenario may not actually be feasible. However, if any potential boo came over and detailed my car without my having to ask, I\u2019d be just as happy.", "keywords": ["id", "married", "having", "youre", "im", "kids", "dont", "marriage", "life", "fine", "marriedand", "single", "living"], "polarity": 0.12121212121212123, "subjectivity": 0.5279741236772487},

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ...

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["educators", "program", "forward", "especially", "schools", "teachers", "moving", "armed", "gun", "approved", "children", "florida", "black", "students", "laws", "legislature", "dangerous", "school"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

Its legacy alone has dismissed critics (i.e., Newsweek\u2019s 1993 article with its \u201cbooty-shaking sugar mamas\u201d comment), paving the way for shows like Insecure, and still reigns as a beloved fixture of black entertainment and pop culture.\n\n\n\nThe show\u2019s creator\u2014television writer and executive producer Yvette Lee Bowser, now 52\u2014saw the need for a strong black female voice in the television landscape in the early 1990s. After leaving A Different World (she wrote the iconic 1992 wedding episode, \u201cSave the Best for Last,\u201d as her goodbye) for new opportunities, and while producing Hanging With Mr. Cooper, she created the concept for Living Single.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel blessed that my vision and the characters have stuck with people through the decades.

There was no longer a platform for strong black female voices. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t see myself. That was my impetus for creating the show.\u201d\n\n\n\nInspired by the chronicles of her personal life, the show focused on six black 20-somethings living in a Brooklyn, N.Y., brownstone juggling their love lives, careers, friendship and making sense of life in \u201ca \u201990s kind of world.\u201d\n\n\n\nStarring Queen Latifah (Khadijah), Kim Coles (Synclaire), Kim Fields (Regine), Erika Alexander (Max), T.C. Carson (Kyle) and John Henton (Overton), the show debuted on Aug. 22, 1993, after Martin, becoming an immediate ratings hit. Through Bowser\u2019s production company, SisterLee, Living Single became one of the most popular sitcoms\u2014ranking among the top five in African-American households for its entire five-year run. At age 27, Bowser made history by becoming the first black woman to develop a hit prime-time series.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe blessing for me is that we\u2019ve been on the air since \u201993. Since the show premiered, it\u2019s been on somebody\u2019s network,\u201d Living Single co-star Henton says of the show\u2019s syndication. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a marathon running of Living Single somewhere right now. Not bad for my first show.\u201d\n\n\n\nActress-comedian Coles, who transitioned to Living Single from the sketch-comedy show In Living Color, recalls the \u201cjoy, laughter and hilarity\u201d of being on set of Living Single.\n\n\n\n\u201cLaughter every single day. We actually became friends and did things together. A lot of people don\u2019t know that T.C. and Erika\u2014Max and Kyle\u2014have the same birthday. I was there the day that they discovered it,\u201d Coles says. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken birthday trips together, we\u2019ve celebrated relationships coming together, relationships falling apart. You become family. We made our crew laugh, we\u2019ve gotten on our crew\u2019s nerves. We had a magical connection. The experience that I\u2019ve had on Living Single overall has raised the bar for me of what I want on a set going forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson says that what he thought \u201cwas just another job\u201d he\u2019d booked turned into his \u201cmaking friendships that would last a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel grateful and blessed to ... have been a part of something that has that type of impact. To be a part of something that was that iconic. Not everybody gets the chance in their life to be a part of something like that,\u201d Carson says.\n\n\n\nMentoring a new generation of television writers, Bowser calls her career of producing shows and telling stories that resonate with audiences \u201cone of the greatest privileges, responsibilities and joys\u201d of her life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root talked with Kim Coles, Erika Alexander, John Hinton and T.C. Carson about the show\u2019s legacy.\n\n\n\nOn the show being celebrated today:\n\nKim Coles: Well it absolutely warms my heart when people come up and say, \u201cYou\u2019re part of my childhood,\u201d \u201cI was like you.\u201d People call me Synclaire or go \u201cSo-and-so is my favorite character\u201d or \u201cThank you so much for being such a positive view of young black people.\u201d So, it has been an incredible ride, and I knew from the moment that we first all six sat down to read the script that it was going to be magical. Like, I knew immediately that we were meant to be together and I had a strong feeling that it would last; I had no idea that it would last this long, and the legacy has lasted this long, but I\u2019m so grateful. It\u2019s been a fun ride, an absolute fun ride.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Henton: That\u2019s the biggest blessing for me, that people still love it after all of these years. When I was growing up it was Good Times, Sanford and Son, the great shows of that era. Nobody had ever seen young black stockbrokers, black lawyers, black publishers. Even though I was a handyman, I was proud and I was good at what I did. These were young people on the go, coming up. It was fresh, it was new, and it\u2019d never been done before.\n\n\n\nWhat they like about their characters:\n\nT.C. Carson: His commitment to his people and his culture. That was the thing I wanted to push with that character. We hadn\u2019t really seen that on TV from a black man who was in the position he was in. A black man that worked on Wall Street that was a stockbroker that had the kind of financial influence that he had. He was also an amalgamation of quite a few people in my life: my father, a lawyer friend of mine, a couple of doctor friends of mine. So I pulled from the people that I knew to create this persona of this person who I thought we should see.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErika Alexander: I had a history of having strong women around me. I went to an all-girls high school, I\u2019ve been taught by really strong women, my mother is a strong woman. When I see Max, I see Whoopi Goldberg, I see Cicely Tyson, I see those strong \u201970s women that I grew up looking at. She was a young black woman with dark skin who had a career. Most importantly, she was sexually free and did not apologize for being strong or smart, and she certainly didn\u2019t apologize for liking sex.\n\n\n\nJH: Overton was simple, but he was smart. He had his own homespun wisdom. People always laugh, but he was the smartest guy on the show. He just had a crazy country way of putting it, but he knew exactly what was going on. Maybe he wasn\u2019t college-educated, but he knew what was up. He had that old-school wisdom, and the fact that he was in love with Synclaire\u2014that was his woman, that was his goal in life. To get with that woman. And he made that happen.\n\n\n\nKC: Synclaire is a piece of who I am. I\u2019m an awkward black girl; I always have been. I think that Synclaire allowed me to embrace that and be weird and be a unicorn, and be all right with it. She gave other young black girls or other women, in general, an opportunity to embrace being weird or different or a little quirky. So she\u2019s very much who I am at my core. I\u2019m less naive than she is, and I don\u2019t like trolls like she does, but that childlike curiosity of the world, loving on people, is who I am at the core.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship with Yvette Lee Bowser:\n\nYvette Lee Bowser: They were extraordinarily talented, and they had chemistry like no other. Immediately! We caught lightning in a bottle when we assembled this cast, and that\u2019s what you have to do to be in contention to have a hit show. You really need to capture that chemistry. It takes skill and it takes luck. Each of the actors cared about their characters in such a way that they brought a new dimension to them.\n\nKC: I don\u2019t know if Yvette gets the credit that she\u2019s due. She was just seasoned and just so smart. She was smart and beautiful and really cared deeply about creating an experience for the audience that was uplifting. And I know today we use the word \u201cwoke.\u201d We had several topics that could fall into the woke category, and you have Yvette to thank for that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJH: She was cool. She was very giving. We would always go meet with Yvette and talk about the character and pitch some ideas. They would go and write it, but she was always open to our opinions, and anytime where a line wasn\u2019t working, then you\u2019d have something in your back pocket that you could try, and if it did work, they\u2019d put it in the show. I liked the freedom, and Yvette afforded us that.\n\nFavorite episodes:\n\nTCC: The episode dealing with Kyle\u2019s hair because it showed how we do each other, because the bosses didn\u2019t have a problem with my hair, but the brother that I worked with did. When I got to sing \u201cMy Funny Valentine\u201d and \u201cA Rage in Harlem,\u201d when we went back to the jazz club days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJH: The Thanksgiving episode with Heavy D; that was one of my favorites. And the holiday shows: Overton with the pink Santa Claus suit that shrunk.\n\n\n\nKC: \u201cMisleading Lady,\u201d when Synclaire wanted to audition for a theater group and they were not taking any more women, so she dressed up as a man. I loved the sideburns; I looked like Sinbad. It was a really funny episode and really fun to play, to dress up as a dude. They had to bind my breasts, and what\u2019s funny is that my breast wouldn\u2019t stay down. [Laughs.]\n\n\n\nEA: When we went back in time in the \u201950s and they were like the Supremes, and Khadijah stole Max\u2019s position as the lead singer in the group, and when T.C. sang \u201cMy Funny Valentine.\u201d Every time they dealt with music, I liked it \u2019cause T.C. usually sings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYLB: I loved the 100th episode, where we flashbacked to how they all came to live together when Synclaire moved to New York. Max, Regine and Khadijah had originally lived together, and they had this epic fight that led to Max moving across the street. That was a real [wish] fulfillment for me because when I conceived the show, originally, all four lived together. Then executive input caused me to make the decision to have Max live across the street to add some comedy to that. So I always wanted to come back and revisit the original concept that Max had lived with them.\n\nTheir thoughts on possibly revisiting the characters in a reboot:\n\nTCC: It would be a great opportunity to be able to tell the story of what\u2019s going on right now and how we are a resilient people, even through the things that are going on in this country. The love that we have for each other, the love that we have for our culture and our friends, is still stronger than the hate that somebody has for us. As long as we didn\u2019t go back, as long as we\u2019re moving forward with these people\u2014who these people are at this stage\u2014it would be great. I would love working with my friends again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKC: I\u2019m sure that Synclaire and Overton are still together and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still happy, and I\u2019m sure that Synclaire has grown into the woman she\u2019s supposed to be. She\u2019s still awkward, yummy, goofy and loving life. If it happens, I would absolutely embrace it.\n\n\n\nJH: Did they have their twins Syncloverton and Overclaire? I would imagine that they\u2019re still together and they\u2019ve got kids in college by now. It\u2019ll be a different dynamic, but they would still be a great couple. Just still in love and still having fun \u2019cause that\u2019s just the way they are. I did a comedy show with Kim Coles, and we just talked about so much, and anytime we have a chance to get together, we just have so much fun.\n\n\n\nEA: I can only imagine that a character like her, if her core is to be an individual and be strong, maybe she is in something that is totally against her being a lawyer. Totally in something with her being in constant with who she is, and her trying to walk through it. I don\u2019t know what that is exactly, but I\u2019d definitely put her in the hot seat. I think that\u2019s what happens in your 40s. All the confidence you once had you start to lack. Sometimes you lose your way a bit. It would be interesting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYLB: I haven\u2019t been able to go into that kind of detail \u2019cause that could be telling you what\u2019s in my head. I will tell you that anything is possible \u2019cause these characters are always alive in my mind. They live inside of me, so I\u2019ll just say that. [Laughs.]\n\n\n\nAshley G.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["white", "racist", "know", "im", "plan", "stuff", "gun", "right", "donald", "crime", "solved", "lives", "black", "trump", "matter", "nra", "think"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

While some of us were immediately joyful about seeing the return of Khadijah James, Regine Hunter and Maxine Shaw and hearing the phrase, \u201cPut some beans in that oven,\u201d others were naturally skeptical. After all, we did see the Shaft reboot, which, for some odd reason, is getting yet another reboot.\n\n\n\nStill, given the boom of white-led revivals and reboots in recent years, it\u2019s about time that black shows cash in on nostalgia and Hollywood\u2019s total disinterest in original ideas. With that in mind, I\u2019ll be playing the role of fake-ass development executive and outlining potential reboots of previous Negro-focused programming of yore. If you hate me playing the role of melanin-enriched Andy Cohen, that\u2019s fine, but remember this, beloveds: This shit still sounds better than a second Shaft reboot. Can you dig it?\n\nHomeboys in Outer Space\n\nWe don\u2019t invite back the original characters, only the title. In the revamped version, we get a sci-fi drama about black people who venture to another planet after the 45th president of the United States of America, Mango Zedong, blows up the damn world. They leave white people\u2014and, thus, most of their troubles\u2014behind in a new world they build from scratch. Put this on Netflix so they can really talk their shit.\n\nGirlfriends\n\nI feel like Tracee Ellis Ross is too busy for this, but we really need to see this show back, if for no other reason than that Toni and Joan have got to make peace. Also: William needs to tip out of the closet. No shade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoesha\n\nAfter six seasons, the show ended on a cliffhanger\u2014incredibly insulting, given how instrumental the series was in making UPN matter as long as it did. Brandy herself was asked about this and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, and I feel so bad because, you know, so many of the fans, they\u2019re mad about that. That\u2019s not the way you end a show that\u2019s been on for six years. So, I\u2019m sorry, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nYou know, looking back, Moesha Mitchell was annoying as all hell. I still loathe that brat for turning down a free car just because it was a Saturn. She\u2019s like a middle-class Vanessa Huxtable who behaves like Donald Trump Jr. during his terrible-twos stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any event, in a revival, it\u2019s worth exploring what happened. In my mind, Dorian\u2019s friend kidnapped Myles, killed him, and 20 years later, we come to see a less obnoxious, humbled Moesha working in media. As for who was pregnant, it was Niecy, and she takes a more prominent role in the show.\n\n\n\nNow, with respect to Kim Parker, she fell off with both of them, got colored contacts and a terrible wig and ended up a sad reality star. The new season would focus on the trio renewing their friendship. If Sheryl Lee Ralph and William Allen Young are available, they can come back, only I feel like Dee Mitchell would be on her Tina Lawson after divorcing Mathew Knowles.\n\nNew York Undercover\n\nIdeally I\u2019d like to forget the horrific last season of this show and bring Eddie Torres back from the dead. Unfortunately, the illegally streamed YouTube episodes don\u2019t lie, so we have to deal with the conditions we\u2019re given. To that end, J.C. Williams should play an Olivia Benson-like leader of a new squad. It would be interesting to see a minority-centered crime show, notably in an era in which law enforcement increasingly targets minorities. And we need to figure out how to bring in George Gore II and Lauren V\u00e9lez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily Matters\n\nI only want this show to come back on a limited 10-episode run in which Steve Urkel has been placed in a mental institution because, let\u2019s be honest, that nerd was a stalker, and when he became Stephan Urkel, that was a sign that he needed to be committed. Let Little Richie be his psychiatrist. And, no, Eddie Winslow cannot come back because he\u2019s going to try to sing again.\n\nAlso: We need to find out what happened to the youngest sister who went upstairs and never came down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Central\n\nLarenz Tate looks the same age and Jennifer Lopez likely owes the creator a favor.\n\nMartin\n\nTichina Arnold deserves a vehicle themed all around her brilliance, and the people deserve a spinoff about Pamela James.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.)

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["nra", "celebrate", "proposed", "weapons", "rick", "enforcement", "mental", "gun", "law", "florida", "gov", "health", "shouldnt", "scott", "trump", "yes", "ranks", "school"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

So for this week\u2019s show (audio), we teamed up with two Chicago-based newsrooms \u2014 the Data Reporting Lab and the Chicago Reporter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what they found:\n\n\u201cThe real story behind Chicago\u2019s gun death stats\n\n\u201cSignificantly fewer people are dying because of gun violence in Chicago. However, it turns out that more people are actually being shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGun homicides dropped by 30 percent in the last two decades, and law enforcement officials take credit for the drop.\n\n\u201cAnalysis from the Data Reporting Lab throws cold water on that theory: Shootings in the city actually increased by 15 percent during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe reporters found a different cause for the decline in deaths: improvements in trauma care at hospitals, thanks to innovations pulled from the battlefields of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConfronted with this new information, officials say closely studying injuries, not deaths, could change how local governments try to solve gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead more: The Bleeding of Chicago\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened after Chicago\u2019s great school closure\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s historic school closures were supposed to help kids in bad schools, but researchers determined that most kids didn\u2019t see improvements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2013, Chicago\u2019s school board voted to close 50 schools \u2013 an unusually large number.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Mayor Rahm Emanuel claimed the closures were to ensure that kids in bad schools made their way to better ones.\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s public schools have lost more than 52,000 students in the past 10 years. That\u2019s because school closures sometimes prompt parents to leave the city altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd black neighborhoods have suffered some of the most severe declines and most of the school closures and budget cuts. A loss of 11,000 students in 2016 \u2018tracked closely with population decline in communities with high crime or poverty,\u2019 according to a report from WBEZ.\u201d\n\n\n\n700 Honor Editor, Historian Lerone Bennett Jr.\n\nImage: Journal-isms\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It Was Always About Our Struggle,\u2019 a Friend Says\n\nBy Cheryl V.

Thomas, who took office Jan. 1, said, \u201cLerone Bennett Jr. is the model for Morehouse men. I look out at the 2,000 students and see somewhere among them is a Lerone Bennett. I have to go forth as if each one of these 2,000 young men is my Lerone Bennett.\u201d About 40 alumni sang the school hymn. At the visitation Friday night, about 30 members of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity sang the Kappa song.\n\nThose dearly held institutions also included Johnson Publishing Co., where Bennett wrote about key events in the civil rights movement, and where he published works that have been on coffee tables and library shelves for decades. Among them is a 1964 biography of King, his Morehouse classmate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett worked for Ebony magazine from 1954 until his retirement in 2003.\n\n\u201cLerone was the historian that Dr. King trusted the most because he knew him best,\u201d the Rev.

It\u2019s a worthwhile question, given the police killings of unarmed black men in recent years.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be. There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a school of mostly white students in a fairly affluent suburb. But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.\n\n\u201c \u2018Another tragic moment. But there are folks in communities that I know who have been burying their kids for a long time because guns have been in their communities.

And all five elected not to use a black photographer to handle the representation of the all-black starring cast of Black Panther.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, five white men, one white woman and one Asian woman were tasked with creating the pictures, which have immediately gone viral, especially on Black Twitter. (Kwaku Alston did shoot a Black Panther cover for Entertainment Weekly last fall.) . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Essence\n\nLewis also wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, this is far from the first time that magazines have missed an opportunity to make a statement with who they hire to shoot their covers. . . . When you look at three of the largest magazines that write about and reflect African-American culture \u2014 Essence, Ebony and GQ \u2014 you see the lack of African-American photographers is nothing new.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2017, [among] the three magazines, just 4.25 covers were made by a black photographer, and three of them were done by the same person. (The .25 comes about because a photographer shot one photo in a series for a cover image.)\u201c\n\nBrooke Pawling Stennett, digital managing editor of the Columbia Chronicle at Columbia College Chicago, cited Lewis\u2019 piece Sunday in making a similar point about covering a popular Korean boy band.\n\n\u201cIn the last year, South Korean boyband BTS, also known as Bulletproof Boyscouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the U.S. for a group that does not sing in English \u2014 except for a few lyrics. 2017 was huge for BTS: It became the first ever K-Pop group to win a Billboard award, hit top 10 on the American iTunes charts, performed at the American Music Awards and rung in 2018 on Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the success came with a major drawback. The only member of the group who speaks semi-fluent English is the \u2018leader,\u2019 RM, though other members memorize certain phrases for interviews. During the group\u2019s press tours in March and November 2017, the other six members were forced to sit in nearly complete silence until RM got a second to breathe and translate the questions.\n\nPhoto: Journal-isms\n\n\u201cAnd most of the time, there was no time to translate, thus alienating the members and resulting in mass video compilations of painfully awkward silences. Not only did the members not understand a majority of what was being said, but the journalists also floundered when the members did their best to communicate and were met with blank looks or a quick diversion. Sure, this is funny in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t until BTS was the face of Billboard Magazine\u2019s February issue that it became apparent how unfunny it was. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cE.

Not because I don\u2019t want to keep covering it, but because I\u2019d so love to see us hire an indigenous writer who can decide what stories need telling, and how best to tell them. (To be clear, I don\u2019t think that indigenous people should only report on indigenous matters; one of the beauties of the BuzzFeed culture section is that we\u2019re able to write in a way that matches our broad interests.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince white people first arrived in the Americas, they have been the primary authors of the Native experience for other white people, using rhetoric that transformed annihilation, exploitation, and degradation into, well, the story of Thanksgiving, and Pocahontas, and countless other bloodless, white savior narratives. No matter how sensitive I try to be, no matter how much I shut up, I am still a part of that long and unforgivably destructive history. It\u2019s not my personal fault, per se, but it is my fault if I can\u2019t understand that legacy and my place in it.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about diversity or discrimination in this country, Natives are generally made invisible. . . .\n\n\u201cNatives are also generally excluded from conversations about diversity in newsrooms. Maybe it\u2019s that most national newsrooms are located in places without prominent Native populations; maybe it\u2019s that most editors, like most people, have never lived in a place where Native issues were framed (by the white press) as prominent. But the logic that encourages hiring more Muslim reporters, more trans reporters, more black reporters, more non-binary reporters, more non-coastal reporters, more conservative reporters, should naturally extend to indigenous reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf, after Trump\u2019s election, we actually want to take issues of class and rural-ness more seriously, it makes sense to hire someone familiar with some of the most working class and rural parts of the nation: reservations. (It also makes sense to hire a Native person who didn\u2019t grow up on a reservation \u2014 as Tommy Orange\u2019s book explains, if there\u2019s anything more invisible than the reservation Native, it\u2019s the Urban Native). . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Susan Cox\n\nL.A.

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

(Credit: ABC News)\n\nHow Supremacist Trolls Spread Rumors to Media\n\n\u201cFollowing misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group,\u201d Shawn Musgrave reported Friday for Politico.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201c \u2018A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u2019 the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories. We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . . So, it just reminds me of how important our jobs are and how lucky we are as journalists to be able to do it.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom DiChristopher reported Friday for cnbc.com, \u201cBoxoffice.com is currently forecasting the movie will haul in $190 million to $215 million over the long weekend. The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

Nope; as with most things involving the presidency, he passed the buck by claiming that he can\u2019t spend time at the White House because it\u2019s a \u201creal dump.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind that President KFC\u2019s beloved Mar-a-Lago kitchen was so filthy that it was cited with 13 health-code violations.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, Mar-a-Lago\u2019s kitchen was cited Jan. 26 for the following:\n\n\u25aa Fish designed to be served raw or undercooked, the inspection report reads, had not undergone proper parasite destruction. Kitchen staffers were ordered to cook the fish immediately or throw it out. \u25aa In two of the club\u2019s coolers, inspectors found that raw meats that should be stored at 41 degrees were much too warm and potentially dangerous: chicken was 49 degrees, duck clocked in a 50 degrees and raw beef was 50 degrees. The winner? Ham at 57 degrees. \u25aa The club was cited for not maintaining the coolers in proper working order and was ordered to have them emptied immediately and repaired.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd get this: The sink where workers are supposed to wash their hand didn\u2019t even get hot enough to sanitize their hands\u2014but the White House is a real dump.\n\nJust imagine for a second that ... wait, nope. We aren\u2019t even going to imagine the president of black America in this situation until further notice because those who love President Xeno-Hatred love him because he hates.

The story originally appeared on the website Golf.com and in Sports Illustrated.\n\n\u201cThe story recounts a scene in which Trump was chatting with some club members. Trump told the members he makes such frequent appearances at the property in Bedminster, New Jersey, because: \u2018That White House is a real dump,\u2019\u201d CNBC reports.\n\n\n\nAs the news site notes, Trump\u2019s lazy ass hasn\u2019t passed any legislation, but he\u2019s spent nearly every weekend away from the White House.

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["chris", "going", "suggestions", "policy", "student", "teachers", "teacher", "worst", "class", "day", "arming", "shit", "probably", "students", "school"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff.

The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson.

He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached.

But in the short term, the Trump-backed immigration proposal, combined with other recent moves by the administration and its allies \u2014 support for voter suppression, gerrymandering and various other schemes to disenfranchise minority voters \u2014 could extend the white hegemony that brought Trump to power and sustains Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor ages, Republicans said that their beef was with illegal immigrants and that legal immigrants should be embraced and welcomed. No longer. In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security. The dispute is really about the Trump proposal to rein in legal immigration by undoing the family-based approach, in which immigrants petition to bring over immediate family, that has always been at the heart of U.S. immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough details aren\u2019t yet known, estimates are that the legislation would cut legal immigration, currently 1.1 million per year, by 300,000 to 500,000 annually.

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election and benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well-covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said that turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared with that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt that a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist.

That\u2019s because school closures sometimes prompt parents to leave the city altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd black neighborhoods have suffered some of the most severe declines and most of the school closures and budget cuts.

It\u2019s a worthwhile question, given the police killings of unarmed black men in recent years.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be. There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a school of mostly white students in a fairly affluent suburb. But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.\n\n\u201c \u2018Another tragic moment. But there are folks in communities that I know who have been burying their kids for a long time because guns have been in their communities. Parents have been grieving because they\u2019ve been putting their babies in [the] ground,\u2019 Eddie S. Glaude, a Princeton University religion and African American studies professor, told MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGlaude added that it took \u2018certain kinds of people to die for us to get this question on the table.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to arming teachers and the factor race might play, two issues are being raised: (1) Arming teachers of black students who may have a racial bias, and (2) arming black teachers and education workers, who face their own risks carrying a weapon. . . .\u2019 \u201c\n\nJonathan Capehart, Washington Post: An open letter to Alfonso Calderon and the kids of Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: The real test for Parkland\u2019s young activists is when the media attention goes away\n\nJulia Manchester, the Hill: Media organizations sue for security footage from outside Florida high school\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr., Washington Post Writers Group: America needs to talk about a lot more than just guns\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobyn Pennacchia, Quartz: What America is getting wrong about three important words in the Second Amendment\n\nThe South Korean boy band BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys and Bulletproof Boy Scouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the United States for a group that mostly does not sing in English.

And all five elected not to use a black photographer to handle the representation of the all-black starring cast of Black Panther.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, five white men, one white woman and one Asian woman were tasked with creating the pictures, which have immediately gone viral, especially on Black Twitter. (Kwaku Alston did shoot a Black Panther cover for Entertainment Weekly last fall.) . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Essence\n\nLewis also wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, this is far from the first time that magazines have missed an opportunity to make a statement with who they hire to shoot their covers. . . . When you look at three of the largest magazines that write about and reflect African-American culture \u2014 Essence, Ebony and GQ \u2014 you see the lack of African-American photographers is nothing new.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2017, [among] the three magazines, just 4.25 covers were made by a black photographer, and three of them were done by the same person. (The .25 comes about because a photographer shot one photo in a series for a cover image.)\u201c\n\nBrooke Pawling Stennett, digital managing editor of the Columbia Chronicle at Columbia College Chicago, cited Lewis\u2019 piece Sunday in making a similar point about covering a popular Korean boy band.\n\n\u201cIn the last year, South Korean boyband BTS, also known as Bulletproof Boyscouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the U.S. for a group that does not sing in English \u2014 except for a few lyrics. 2017 was huge for BTS: It became the first ever K-Pop group to win a Billboard award, hit top 10 on the American iTunes charts, performed at the American Music Awards and rung in 2018 on Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the success came with a major drawback. The only member of the group who speaks semi-fluent English is the \u2018leader,\u2019 RM, though other members memorize certain phrases for interviews. During the group\u2019s press tours in March and November 2017, the other six members were forced to sit in nearly complete silence until RM got a second to breathe and translate the questions.\n\nPhoto: Journal-isms\n\n\u201cAnd most of the time, there was no time to translate, thus alienating the members and resulting in mass video compilations of painfully awkward silences. Not only did the members not understand a majority of what was being said, but the journalists also floundered when the members did their best to communicate and were met with blank looks or a quick diversion. Sure, this is funny in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t until BTS was the face of Billboard Magazine\u2019s February issue that it became apparent how unfunny it was. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cE. Alex Jung, a freelance journalist was sent to Seoul, South Korea, to interview BTS for the cover. . . .\n\n\u201cThough Jung points out in his Feb. 15 article that his Korean is \u2018like a 10-year-old\u2019s,\u2019 in the words of RM, at least Billboard had the decency to send someone who can interview a Korean group in the language its members are comfortable, no matter if he got help or not.\n\n\u201cJung took to Twitter shortly after the release of the interview, stating in a Feb. 15 tweet: \u2018[A]lso, props to Billboard for hiring someone (yes, in this case me) who can speak Korean to interview a Korean group. I\u2019ve seen way too many publications send non-Korean speaking reporters to cover K-Pop and it truly blows my mind how that\u2019s acceptable journalistic practice.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephanie Mehta Named Editor of Fast Company\n\nPhoto: Folio\n\n\u201cMansueto Ventures has tapped Vanity Fair deputy editor Stephanie Mehta as the next editor-in-chief of Fast Company,\u201d Greg Dool reported Monday for Folio:, quoting CEO Eric Schurenberg.

Not because I don\u2019t want to keep covering it, but because I\u2019d so love to see us hire an indigenous writer who can decide what stories need telling, and how best to tell them. (To be clear, I don\u2019t think that indigenous people should only report on indigenous matters; one of the beauties of the BuzzFeed culture section is that we\u2019re able to write in a way that matches our broad interests.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince white people first arrived in the Americas, they have been the primary authors of the Native experience for other white people, using rhetoric that transformed annihilation, exploitation, and degradation into, well, the story of Thanksgiving, and Pocahontas, and countless other bloodless, white savior narratives. No matter how sensitive I try to be, no matter how much I shut up, I am still a part of that long and unforgivably destructive history. It\u2019s not my personal fault, per se, but it is my fault if I can\u2019t understand that legacy and my place in it.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about diversity or discrimination in this country, Natives are generally made invisible. . . .\n\n\u201cNatives are also generally excluded from conversations about diversity in newsrooms. Maybe it\u2019s that most national newsrooms are located in places without prominent Native populations; maybe it\u2019s that most editors, like most people, have never lived in a place where Native issues were framed (by the white press) as prominent. But the logic that encourages hiring more Muslim reporters, more trans reporters, more black reporters, more non-binary reporters, more non-coastal reporters, more conservative reporters, should naturally extend to indigenous reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf, after Trump\u2019s election, we actually want to take issues of class and rural-ness more seriously, it makes sense to hire someone familiar with some of the most working class and rural parts of the nation: reservations. (It also makes sense to hire a Native person who didn\u2019t grow up on a reservation \u2014 as Tommy Orange\u2019s book explains, if there\u2019s anything more invisible than the reservation Native, it\u2019s the Urban Native). . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Susan Cox\n\nL.A.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["seeking", "parkland", "fla", "far", "shooting", "douglas", "school", "stoneman", "gun", "right", "theories", "aide", "used", "state", "students", "reform", "survivors"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

However, it turns out that more people are actually being shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGun homicides dropped by 30 percent in the last two decades, and law enforcement officials take credit for the drop.\n\n\u201cAnalysis from the Data Reporting Lab throws cold water on that theory: Shootings in the city actually increased by 15 percent during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe reporters found a different cause for the decline in deaths: improvements in trauma care at hospitals, thanks to innovations pulled from the battlefields of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConfronted with this new information, officials say closely studying injuries, not deaths, could change how local governments try to solve gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead more: The Bleeding of Chicago\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened after Chicago\u2019s great school closure\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s historic school closures were supposed to help kids in bad schools, but researchers determined that most kids didn\u2019t see improvements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2013, Chicago\u2019s school board voted to close 50 schools \u2013 an unusually large number.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Mayor Rahm Emanuel claimed the closures were to ensure that kids in bad schools made their way to better ones.\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s public schools have lost more than 52,000 students in the past 10 years. That\u2019s because school closures sometimes prompt parents to leave the city altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd black neighborhoods have suffered some of the most severe declines and most of the school closures and budget cuts.

It\u2019s a worthwhile question, given the police killings of unarmed black men in recent years.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s another layer to the conversation about how racialized the debate around gun violence can be. There has not been a mass shooting in a predominantly minority high school that compares to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a school of mostly white students in a fairly affluent suburb. But some activists have pointed out that there are some students who face gun violence in their community on an almost daily basis.\n\n\u201c \u2018Another tragic moment.

And all five elected not to use a black photographer to handle the representation of the all-black starring cast of Black Panther.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, five white men, one white woman and one Asian woman were tasked with creating the pictures, which have immediately gone viral, especially on Black Twitter. (Kwaku Alston did shoot a Black Panther cover for Entertainment Weekly last fall.) . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Essence\n\nLewis also wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, this is far from the first time that magazines have missed an opportunity to make a statement with who they hire to shoot their covers. . . . When you look at three of the largest magazines that write about and reflect African-American culture \u2014 Essence, Ebony and GQ \u2014 you see the lack of African-American photographers is nothing new.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2017, [among] the three magazines, just 4.25 covers were made by a black photographer, and three of them were done by the same person. (The .25 comes about because a photographer shot one photo in a series for a cover image.)\u201c\n\nBrooke Pawling Stennett, digital managing editor of the Columbia Chronicle at Columbia College Chicago, cited Lewis\u2019 piece Sunday in making a similar point about covering a popular Korean boy band.\n\n\u201cIn the last year, South Korean boyband BTS, also known as Bulletproof Boyscouts, has achieved unparalleled success in the U.S. for a group that does not sing in English \u2014 except for a few lyrics. 2017 was huge for BTS: It became the first ever K-Pop group to win a Billboard award, hit top 10 on the American iTunes charts, performed at the American Music Awards and rung in 2018 on Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the success came with a major drawback. The only member of the group who speaks semi-fluent English is the \u2018leader,\u2019 RM, though other members memorize certain phrases for interviews. During the group\u2019s press tours in March and November 2017, the other six members were forced to sit in nearly complete silence until RM got a second to breathe and translate the questions.\n\nPhoto: Journal-isms\n\n\u201cAnd most of the time, there was no time to translate, thus alienating the members and resulting in mass video compilations of painfully awkward silences. Not only did the members not understand a majority of what was being said, but the journalists also floundered when the members did their best to communicate and were met with blank looks or a quick diversion. Sure, this is funny in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t until BTS was the face of Billboard Magazine\u2019s February issue that it became apparent how unfunny it was. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cE. Alex Jung, a freelance journalist was sent to Seoul, South Korea, to interview BTS for the cover. . . .\n\n\u201cThough Jung points out in his Feb. 15 article that his Korean is \u2018like a 10-year-old\u2019s,\u2019 in the words of RM, at least Billboard had the decency to send someone who can interview a Korean group in the language its members are comfortable, no matter if he got help or not.\n\n\u201cJung took to Twitter shortly after the release of the interview, stating in a Feb. 15 tweet: \u2018[A]lso, props to Billboard for hiring someone (yes, in this case me) who can speak Korean to interview a Korean group. I\u2019ve seen way too many publications send non-Korean speaking reporters to cover K-Pop and it truly blows my mind how that\u2019s acceptable journalistic practice.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephanie Mehta Named Editor of Fast Company\n\nPhoto: Folio\n\n\u201cMansueto Ventures has tapped Vanity Fair deputy editor Stephanie Mehta as the next editor-in-chief of Fast Company,\u201d Greg Dool reported Monday for Folio:, quoting CEO Eric Schurenberg.

Not because I don\u2019t want to keep covering it, but because I\u2019d so love to see us hire an indigenous writer who can decide what stories need telling, and how best to tell them. (To be clear, I don\u2019t think that indigenous people should only report on indigenous matters; one of the beauties of the BuzzFeed culture section is that we\u2019re able to write in a way that matches our broad interests.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince white people first arrived in the Americas, they have been the primary authors of the Native experience for other white people, using rhetoric that transformed annihilation, exploitation, and degradation into, well, the story of Thanksgiving, and Pocahontas, and countless other bloodless, white savior narratives. No matter how sensitive I try to be, no matter how much I shut up, I am still a part of that long and unforgivably destructive history. It\u2019s not my personal fault, per se, but it is my fault if I can\u2019t understand that legacy and my place in it.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about diversity or discrimination in this country, Natives are generally made invisible. . . .\n\n\u201cNatives are also generally excluded from conversations about diversity in newsrooms. Maybe it\u2019s that most national newsrooms are located in places without prominent Native populations; maybe it\u2019s that most editors, like most people, have never lived in a place where Native issues were framed (by the white press) as prominent. But the logic that encourages hiring more Muslim reporters, more trans reporters, more black reporters, more non-binary reporters, more non-coastal reporters, more conservative reporters, should naturally extend to indigenous reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf, after Trump\u2019s election, we actually want to take issues of class and rural-ness more seriously, it makes sense to hire someone familiar with some of the most working class and rural parts of the nation: reservations. (It also makes sense to hire a Native person who didn\u2019t grow up on a reservation \u2014 as Tommy Orange\u2019s book explains, if there\u2019s anything more invisible than the reservation Native, it\u2019s the Urban Native). . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Susan Cox\n\nL.A.

Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV.

Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power.

At 7:39 a.m. EST, Trump, his tummy likely rumbling in anticipation of the first Diet Coke of the day, tweeted the following:\n\nLittle Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\n\nAs the New York Times notes, Schiff plans to call for a vote this afternoon for the Intelligence Committee to release a Democratic \u201crebuttal\u201d to last week\u2019s GOP memo. That memo was put out on Friday after being declassified by the White House, in what many see as a stunt to undermine the Russia investigation.\n\nOf course, leaking classified information is a federal crime, so it\u2019s no small thing to accuse somebody, least of all the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, of doing so. But just as noteworthy: the vague call that Schiff \u201cmust be stopped,\u201d which can certainly be read as a threat against the Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff responded a little more than an hour later via Twitter, in \u201cI\u2019m not new to this, I\u2019m true to this\u201d form.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I see you\u2019ve had a busy morning of \u2018Executive Time,\u2019\u201d Schiff shaded. \u201cInstead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff has sure mastered the use of passive-aggressive punctuation points\u2014I see you with the \u201c\u2018Executive Time\u2019\u201d and shady little ellipses.

Schiff rebutted last week\u2019s GOP memo accusing federal law enforcement officials of abusing their power to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if this systematic, undisciplined targeting of \u201cenemies\u201d (even if the vocabulary employed to do so is limited) were some sort of warning sign for authoritarianism, like trying to intimidate the press, fearmongering, politicizing the military and selective devotion to the law.\n\nYou know, just a little bit.", "keywords": ["president", "sure", "intelligence", "lawmaker", "democratic", "adam", "messy", "belittles", "aint", "schiff", "committee", "house", "original", "memo", "trump", "little"], "polarity": 0.0019283746556473752, "subjectivity": 0.402416207529844},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns-could-sto-1823167744", "title": "/theres-a-theory-that-black-people-buying-guns-could-sto-", "text": "Before one begins any discussion about the gun debate, it is necessary to dismiss the slow-thinking zealots from the room by pointing out that two things can be true: I can believe that Church\u2019s fried chicken is actually deep-fried Triceratops raised on a secret Jurassic Park-type farm, and it tastes delicious. I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["theory", "white", "nra", "money", "members", "kids", "buy", "gun", "right", "theres", "war", "guns", "ownership", "black", "nras", "stop", "believe", "control", "wont"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["president", "likely", "bunch", "shooter", "save", "kids", "hes", "presidents", "trump", "afraid", "run", "school"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "directly", "dont", "gun", "right", "terrorist", "legal", "deaths", "nra", "second", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

One of the women, Colbie Holderness, told the Daily Mail that during a vacation in Florence, Italy, Porter became angry and punched her in the face. Holderness included photos of herself with a badly bruised eye. Porter\u2019s second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, said that the emotionally abusive Porter was physically abusive just once during their marriage but added during an interview with CNN that she was genuinely concerned for Hope Hicks\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cIt definitely worries me because if I\u2019m being frank with you, if he hasn\u2019t already been abusive with Hope, he will.

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference. Sessions, who was head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, can answer questions on the campaign\u2019s ties to the Russians as well as on whether or not Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nRemember, Trump was very upset when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation last year and even said in an interview that he never would have given Sessions the job of attorney general if he had known that was going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, Sessions has tea to spill.\n\nThis is all leading up to the eventual interview between Trump and Mueller, during which the president will likely be questioned about his decisions to send both Flynn and Comey packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team are already preparing themselves for the inevitable. They are hoping to come to an agreement with Mueller\u2019s team that would allow for Trump\u2019s testimony to be part face-to-face interview and part written statement, the Washington Post reports. It would appear that they don\u2019t have much faith in the president\u2019s ability to stick to the script under questioning.\n\nAccording to the Post, Mueller also wants to speak with Trump about his attempts to either fire Sessions or get him to quit his job. A source told the Post that Mueller is looking to determine whether there is a pattern of behavior with the president.\n\nI can answer that right now: Yes, there is. The sooner we get to that part of the dirt, the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he is found to have obstructed justice, will that lead to impeachment? If they are digging up dirt on Trump, can they dig up dirt on his creepy friend from Indiana so that he can take him with him when he goes?\n\nHow much longer are we going to have to wait for the climax of this investigation to happen?\n\nSo many questions, not enough answers.\n\nWe\u2019re counting on you, Robert Mueller.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin. It is a stain on all our hands.

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["white", "sure", "political", "introduce", "nigger", "im", "trumps", "cpac", "pretty", "republican", "convention", "used", "black", "video", "trump", "watch", "conservative", "conservatives", "list"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester.

He asked her why the signatures on her denial letter didn\u2019t match up with the signature found on her autographs.

In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense.

What time of year, you ask? The time of year when President Racist von WallBuilder reads his prepared speech from a teleprompter, and a roomful of fat, rich white guys and affluent white women applaud as if the world were crafted from his tiny hands. This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W. Bush look palatable?\n\n\n\nBelow is a listing of planned protests that might even be effective if the president actually cared about the rest of the 99 percent.\n\n\n\nOff the top, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) aren\u2019t attending the president\u2019s address.

Wilson and the president have never been on good terms, but that rift grew wider when the president reportedly told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that \u201che knew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d Wilson took offense at the heartless comment, and Trump, as he\u2019s been known to do, began attacking the congresswoman on Twitter. So when it came to this year\u2019s State of the Union, Wilson knew that the president didn\u2019t deserve her presence or her sweet cowboy hat!\n\n\n\n\u201cTo go would be to honor the president and I don\u2019t think he deserves to be honored at this time, after being so hateful towards black people and then black countries,\u201d she told CNN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeks had this to say about this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the New York Post reports: \u201cI cannot give this man, who does not respect me, the respect to be in that audience. I will not be there.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats who have noted that they won\u2019t be attending include Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.) and John Lewis (Ga.); Illinois Reps. Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) will be bringing Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victim Advocates, as his plus one; Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, will be a guest of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.); and Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who has researched and written about Taylor, will be a guest of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who went toe-to-toe with the president for his lack of concern after Hurricane Maria ravaged parts of Puerto Rico, will accompany Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nSeveral Congress members are using their invitations to bring faces of the immigration debate, specially those affected by the current stalemate over DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, affecting young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\n\nSome of the more prominent faces of the debate who will be in attendance: Cindy Garcia, the wife of Jorge Garcia, who was deported to Mexico earlier this month after living in the U.S. for 30 years. The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["president", "white", "going", "notes", "victims", "teachers", "violent", "listening", "massshooting", "care", "remember", "house", "teacher", "trump", "check", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["designer", "beachler", "hannah", "studiosdisney", "know", "world", "marvel", "important", "production", "walks", "panther", "black", "africa", "told", "different", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme.

Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016.

OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her that the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing that they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring that the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller didn\u2019t find that suspicious.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate, and there was nothing, nothing at all, that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\n\u201cBandit\u201d is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone. Again, I don\u2019t know, but I suspect that this may be the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, check out her two minutes of denial below.

Nevertheless, Haley, who was always a member of the dark side, aka the Republican Party, has gone fully into the darkness as the United Nations ambassador and possible side chick to the president.\n\n\n\nAs such, Haley seems to have lost her way and her funny bone, since she didn\u2019t seem to take too kindly to Sunday night\u2019s Grammy segment that had Clinton, Cardi B and Snoop Dogg reading bits of the controversial book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it,\u201d Haley tweeted on Sunday night, The Hill reports. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin great music with trash.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing.

It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir!

It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience.

Under most circumstances, a failed presidential party nominee running for a Senate seat wouldn\u2019t be big news. It\u2019d be the equivalent of LeBron James retiring to become a player-coach for Duke after realizing he couldn\u2019t beat Golden State.\n\nHowever, since the 2016 presidential election, Romney has been reimagined by much of the public, and many members on the right, as some sort of moral center and lead anti-Trumpist for the Republican Party. A man willing to call out President Donald Trump for his many foul and inappropriate deeds. Just check out these hits:\n\n\n\nWho can forget Romney calling Trump a phony and a fraud during the 2016 presidential election season?\n\nOr the remix version, when brave Romney called Trump a comforter of and cheerleader for racists after the president\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack? From Facebook:\n\nWhether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn. His apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the feeling was mutual. Donald Trump holds a lot of grudges against Mitt Romney.\n\nHe\u2019s never forgiven Romney for calling him a fraud and a phony; he was furious that prominent Republicans wanted Romney to run as a third-party candidate in 2016; and last, Trump probably can\u2019t get over the fact that even though they\u2019re only a year apart in age, Romney\u2019s mane is always perfectly laid, while Trump\u2019s head looks like he\u2019s had more implants than Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemonstrating the penchant for pettiness that has defined his presidency, Trump spent the first few months after the election engaging in an elaborate Lucy-and-the-football scheme, with Romney doing the most earnest Charlie Brown impression possible. And after months of publicly wining and dining Romney, Trump turned around and gave the job of secretary of state to Rex Tillerson, a Russian-business crony with less experience than on Romney\u2019s pre-Massachusetts r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough; late last year, Trump actively tried to block Romney from running for Senate. In other words, if Romney had even the slightest drop of personal integrity, or even cared about his brand as the moral opposite of Trump, or wanted to keep those rumors alive that he might actually primary Trump in 2020, he\u2019d stick to his guns like he did in 2016, right? He would run for Utah Senate as the anti-Trump or at least make it clear that he was his own man.\n\nExcept no. Mitt Romney is a spineless, craven politician thirsty for any semblance of relevance after America rejected his brand of disingenuous, sanctimonious leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny dreams that he would stand up to Trump (and those had to be drug-induced fantasies born of nothing more than an unrealistic faith in a politician who said that 47 percent of the country wasn\u2019t worth talking to) went out the window when he tweeted this on Monday:\n\nMind you, Trump has never apologized or changed his tune about Charlottesville; within the last week, more women have come out to accuse him of sexual improprieties; and he was defending an alleged abusive spouse less than two weeks ago\u2014and that was after he wholeheartedly endorsed a man accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, now Romney is proud to have this endorsement that was supposedly too awful to accept two years ago. I would say that the voters of Utah deserve better, but they elected Mia Love, so there is that.\n\nI think conservatives deserve better, because if they actually want to run someone for the Senate who will at least morally stand up to Trump, they might want to nominate someone who can at least get off his hands and knees first.", "keywords": ["thirstiest", "americas", "romney", "week", "mitt", "2016", "utah", "senate", "presidential", "trump", "politician", "election", "run"], "polarity": 0.14503375977256575, "subjectivity": 0.46543176972281447},

That is a clear indication that Flynn might be negotiating a plea deal that could include him testifying against the president or senior White House officials, according to the report.\n\nThose negotiations would include prosecutors telling Flynn, off the record, of course, the evidence they have against him. They would then give him the opportunity to disclose what information or evidence he has that could implicate others in the case, up to and including the president himself.\n\nSources told ABC News that prior to last week\u2019s break, Flynn\u2019s legal counsel and Trump\u2019s legal team had engaged in privileged discussions for months.\n\nOne member of the Trump legal team, Jay Sekulow, told ABC News last week that the break was \u201cnot entirely unexpected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about Gen.

Flynn, who worked as a part of Flynn Intel Group.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["seeking", "parkland", "fla", "far", "shooting", "douglas", "school", "stoneman", "gun", "right", "theories", "aide", "used", "state", "students", "reform", "survivors"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

He\u2019s made the United States the most hated country on the planet (again).\n\nNow he\u2019s managed to turn the legislative budgeting process into a ridiculous hostage-taking action movie, complete with colorful henchmen and elaborate traps.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, at midnight, the federal government will go dark because Republicans can\u2019t figure out how to pay their bills. In a fair, rational world, Republicans would admit that it\u2019s their own party\u2019s inability to realize that 2 plus 2 does not equal \u201cMake America great again\u201d that caused this problem in the first place. However, we\u2019re not in a rational world anymore. We\u2019re in a world where accused pedophiles quote Jesus and run for office, a man who calls protesting black NFL players sons of bitches and quotes Martin Luther King Jr., and Cardi B has more top 10 hits than Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nThe Republicans want to hold 850,000 government employees, 800,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals-program recipients and 9 million kids in the Child Health Insurance Program hostage until their demands are met. They insist that the Democratic Party must vote yes on a new budget that funds the government only until Feb. 16, ignores DACA and shortchanges CHIP. The only way the GOP will even touch DACA is if the bill includes funding for Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite nationalist climbing wall\u201d\u2014otherwise the government fails and the kids get nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m convinced that the Democrats\u2014who, up until now, have shown the negotiating skills of a drunk frat boy in Tijuana\u2014must\u2019ve watched a TNT marathon of Olympus Has Fallen or sought the hostage-negotiating counsel of Denzel Washington. (Seriously, next to Jesse Jackson, what black man has saved more people in distress? From that early scene in Ricochet to Man on Fire, John Q and Inside Man\u2014hell, he killed Stringer Bell\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure Denzel could balance the budget, fix immigration and disarm North Korea in 90 minutes. My man!) Either way, Democrats will have to figure out how to stand up to the Republicans\u2019 demands. The only question now is, Who. Blinks. First?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out how we got to this standoff on top of a windswept mountain, with both parties giving speeches about what they not gon\u2019 do. Basically, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t know how to govern. Even though Republicans run everything in Washington, D.C.\u2014the presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the kiosk in Union Station, the Panera in the Capitol Cafeteria\u2014they can\u2019t even get their own party to agree on a long-term budget for government funding.\n\nThe DACA program was ended by Trump, creating a conflict where there was none. The CHIP program expired under GOP leadership; they could fix it in one vote, but they won\u2019t. Since Republicans can\u2019t get their own house in order, they\u2019ll grab CHIP and DACA at gunpoint, hoping to force the Democrats to make up for votes they can\u2019t sway in their own party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is, many Republicans and Democrats are tired of voting for short-term budgets because it wreaks havoc on federal agencies. It\u2019s hard to plan for disaster relief when your credit card might stop working every six weeks. When the last continuing resolution was passed in the House and the Senate in late December, Republicans were mad that it didn\u2019t give more money to the military. Democrats were angry that it didn\u2019t provide a solution for the 800,000 DACA recipients, and members of Congress who actually have fully beating hearts and functional souls were unhappy that 9 million kids might go without CHIP funding in the coming decade.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans in the House managed to pass a short-term spending bill, but passing it in the Senate is another matter. In order to reach the 60 votes needed, every Republican has to vote for the funding bill and about 11 Democrats have to switch sides. Democrats have been screaming \u201cRelease the hostages\u201d\u2014aka calling for a clean DACA bill and CHIP funding\u2014for months now. And Republicans have responded by cocking the trigger: Drop DACA, accept less funding for CHIP, pay for the border wall, give us all your Netflix and Amazon.com passwords, and we\u2019ll have a deal. (The Dems only agreed to the last one.)\n\nI\u2019d like to give credit to Democrats for being principled and holding their ground for kids, but this situation is also because of GOP incompetence. The reason Democrats aren\u2019t folding like MacBooks is that Republicans are lousy hostage takers. They\u2019re like those Somali pirates in Captain Phillips. You aren\u2019t really in charge if you can\u2019t drive the boat, and Republicans can\u2019t even find the steering wheel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nDespite numerical majorities in both houses of Congress, the Republicans only look like they\u2019re in control of the situation. First, Democrats know that even if they voted for a continuing resolution, Republicans would find some way to gut CHIP down the road in a future budget. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the negotiators, also know that President \u201cShithole\u201d is not about to let 800,000 Hispanic kids stay in America; he ended DACA because he is a white nationalist and doesn\u2019t want those kids in America.\n\nIf Trump actually wanted a policy solution with \u201clove,\u201d he could simply reinstate DACA and work with Congress on a solution. But he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t care. When the government shuts down (and it looks all but assured at this point), the party that runs everything in the country is going to get blamed, not the Democrats.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost good movie negotiators figure out the obvious: The hostages are dead anyway. There\u2019s no reason to negotiate. No one will blame you if the serial killer blows up the building and everybody inside because anyone who\u2019s watching knows that you\u2019re dealing with a crazy person. A government shutdown on the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration is the best weapon the Democrats have, a campaign commercial that writes itself.

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["president", "obama", "fake", "weak", "trumps", "ukraine", "gop", "look", "russian", "republican", "making", "hawks", "trump", "russia", "russias"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

As part of those investigations, attorneys for Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, were required to turn over to congressional investigators secret direct messages that were passed back and forth on Twitter between him and WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Atlantic obtained a copy of the messages, and writer Julia Ioffe reported that WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for his cooperation in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the U.S. election and in arranging for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, the first message was sent to Trump Jr. by WikiLeaks at midnight on Sept. 20, 2016\u2014at the height of the presidential campaign\u2014and it read: \u201cA PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch. The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is \u2018putintrump.\u2019 See \u2018About\u2019 for who is behind it.

It was funded by the Progress for USA Political Action Committee and has since moved to Mother Jones, where it now functions as a new project to report on the Trump-Russia ties and foreign influence in U.S. politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the inquiries about Putin-Trump, WikiLeaks continued to solicit Trump Jr.\u2019s cooperation until at least July 2017 with requests that included asking for Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, urging the Trump campaign on Election Day to reject the results of the election as rigged, and requesting that the then president-elect tell Australia to appoint Assange ambassador to the United States.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., told The Atlantic: \u201cOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests. Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to The Atlantic\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday evening, Assange publicly tweeted that he could not confirm the DMs that The Atlantic reports to have because WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t keep those records, and The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cpresentation is edited.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little more than an hour later, Trump Jr. tweeted copies of the DMs reported in The Atlantic\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for the frosting on this cake of disbelief, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau found this juicy little gem:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Trump Jr. colluded, and his daddy (it appears) knew it.\n\nMessy, messy, messy.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the story.

But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["designer", "jeweler", "black", "jewelry", "adorned", "work", "create", "women", "feel", "metal", "panther", "armored", "think", "douriean", "heavy"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["invented", "black", "tharpe", "gospel", "rock", "music", "queer", "recorded", "sister", "n", "woman", "rosetta", "little", "roll"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

Perhaps he hypersexualizes black men because he\u2019s the one out here fucking everyone. He\u2019s the one acting how black men are stereotypically supposed to act. He\u2019s the immoral one who refuses to curtail his sexual urges. He\u2019s the savage.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d bet all the cash in Wakanda that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ain\u2019t the only women he\u2019s slept with while married to Melania. Of course, if two adults consent to sleeping with each other, there\u2019s nothing legally wrong with that, even if one is engaged in an extramarital affair. Morally? Definitely, but it\u2019s not illegal. Perhaps Married Donald is the white Wilt Chamberlain. Or, better yet, Wilt Chamberlain is the black Married Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, he\u2019s just doing what America and white Americans have done since America\u2019s inception, which is do dirt and then claim dark people are inherently dirty.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "black", "married", "hes", "sean", "donald", "women", "wilt", "whos", "theres", "chamberlain", "trump", "sperm", "hannity", "slept"], "polarity": -0.03897849462365592, "subjectivity": 0.4680286738351255},

The president of LittleDick, Ala., is literally spending his time posting phony winners for a phony awards show while the country is currently going to shit from his doing. I keep waiting for this bad Tom Hanks movie to end and the 9-year-old boy whose mind was switched with the president of MudTruckin\u2019, Minn., to be given his brain back.\n\nCurrently we have a president whose diet consists of fast food, who trolls America on Twitter and who makes up fake games to play with himself. It\u2019s as if Congress went to the local Cracker Barrel and asked for one of those busy sheets they give kids while the parents are talking to keep the president of FlyFishing, Fla., busy\u2014and thus the Fake News Awards were born.\n\nThe worst part of this whole sham is that the president of TabackySpitCup, Texas, has routinely told lies and mistruths since taking office. According to the Washington Post, Trump lied over 2,000 times during his first year in the White House. But in the spirit of bipartisanship, we\u2019re reporting Trump\u2019s list of winners because honestly, being opposed by the president of NASCAR, Neb., is a badge of honor.\n\nFirst off, like much of this administration, the shit didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know if the fake-news-media thing was supposed to be lighthearted or what, but late Wednesday night, after several outlets posted that the president was full of crap for announcing that the awards would be coming and then not producing, a seemingly rushed list was ushered onto the GOP\u2019s website, which immediately crashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s as if the website didn\u2019t even want any parts of this dumbass idea. Once the site was functioning, the winners included all the big names that Trump has openly opposed: the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, blah, blah, blah.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue with the New York Times piece cited is that it was a column claiming that the economy would suffer under a Trump presidency\u2014which isn\u2019t fake news because we still don\u2019t know what will happen, and Trump keeps claiming victory for the economic legacy that former President Barack Obama left behind. Assuming that Trump\u2019s plan for utter destruction did somehow boost the economy, the column still wouldn\u2019t be fake news; it would merely be an incorrect prediction, since it was written in 2016, before the president was even in office.\n\nThe Fake News Awards were always going to be a sham. In early January, the president claimed that there would be some kind of event and maybe even trophies!\n\n\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to spoil anything,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, said during a press briefing on Jan. 3, the Washington Post reports. \u201cBut my guess is that there are quite a few individuals that could be up for those awards. ... We\u2019ll certainly keep you posted. It might be hard for him to present trophies if you guys aren\u2019t there. But I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continually teased the idea of specific categories in the Fake News Awards\u2014a task that should have proved easy, considering that he tweeted about \u201cfake news\u201d some 150 times, according to the Post. But the Fake News Awards, much like this administration so far, proved to be a whole lot of talk and very little action. Basically, the Fake News Awards were just more fake news from a president who knows more about being fake than anyone else.\n\nRead more at GOP.com and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["president", "times", "know", "dont", "right", "couldnt", "winners", "trump", "washington", "post", "fake", "awards"], "polarity": -0.08126225987554113, "subjectivity": 0.5560200216450217},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked.

Resolution 40, a bill that overturned a rule designed to prevent certain people with mental health problems from buying a gun. The optics are especially bad given that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used his legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle to gun down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cA White House photographer confirmed to CBS News that there are photos of the bill signing.

There are already many calls to apologize, and there will be more to come. But let\u2019s be real: U.S. media has long treated black and brown countries like \u2018shitholes.\u2019 This TV-loving president is a product of a media culture that has systemically covered places in Africa and places like Haiti only as war-ravaged, disease-ridden and impoverished \u2014 when these countries are even deemed worthy of coverage at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStudies show headlines from major Western media outlets are largely negative when it comes to Africa. It was just last year that a New York Times opinions essay about Congo waxed on about monkey brains and how the country was perhaps better off 100 years ago under colonialism.\n\n\u201cOnly with Africa coverage can programs such as \u201860 Minutes\u2019 get away with parachuting American journalists to Liberia to report on ebola \u2014 and not interview a single Liberian on camera for the story. Western media and literature are riddled with cliche-white savior journalism . That helps to explain why Louise Linton, the now-wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was able to publish an article in the Telegraph (which was later removed from its website) based on her cliche-addled, self-published memoir about her gap year in Zambia. She wrote in the book that Africa is rife with hidden dangers: \u2018I witnessed random acts of violence, contracted malaria and had close encounters with lions, elephants, crocodiles and snakes.\u2019\n\n\u201cNever mind that lazy \u2018Ooga-Booga\u2019 journalism (as journalist Howard French calls [it]) fails to reckon with the fact that African countries are home to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Never mind that long before mobile money-sharing systems such as Venmo came to the United States, countries like Kenya were using mobile platforms including M-Pesa. Never mind that African countries are beginning to produce their own cars, embrace biometric technology and venture into space exploration. When it comes to Africa, American media is rarely interested in positive headlines. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttiah also wrote, \u201cTrump\u2019s comments are just the latest proof that the United States is being led by a man who is an unabashed white supremacist, one who aims to implement policies that will make America white again by limiting immigration from black and brown countries and deporting those who are already here. But in the storm of mainstream anger, it is hypocritical of the media to fail to reckon with and correct its own practices of reporting on black and brown countries and how this coverage affects perceptions about very real people.\u201d\n\nRoy S.

French, former Africa correspondent for the New York Times, wrote Sunday for the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see this as an opportunity to challenge the American public to confront this reality: More than any other factor, it is the wealth derived from Africa, especially the labor of people taken in chains from that continent, that accounts for the rise of the West and its centuries of predominance in world affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe facts of this history hide in plain sight, and yet Americans and others in the West have averted their eyes for 500 years. The West\u2019s ascension over other parts of the world has been attributed, instead, to innate Western qualities, including rationality and a talent for invention and innovation, or Western institutions. It is this distortion of reality \u2014 a delusion, really \u2014 that fuels attitudes of white superiority, whether subtle and pervasive, or as crude as those exhibited by someone like Trump.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the West\u2019s takeoff, beginning at the end of the 15th century, was founded on its proximity both to Africa and to what we now call the Caribbean and Latin America \u2014 the very regions that Trump has slandered. In time, the West would display a ruthless will to plunder the these regions, robbing them of their human and natural resources. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n. . . \u2018Not Just Racist, but Inaccurate\u2019\n\nCommentators of color on the Sunday talk shows rose to the defense of black and brown countries, in some cases because that is where they were born.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d Sunday, Tennessee-born Van Jones, the activist and CNN commentator, defended African immigrants by citing numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPart of I think what is important to keep in mind,\u201d Jones said of President Trump\u2019s comment, \u201cnot only were those comments racist, they are also just inaccurate. When you have 30 percent of Americans have college degrees, 43 percent of African immigrants have college degrees, 10 percent of white Americans have advanced degrees, 25 percent of Nigerian-Americans have advanced degrees.\n\n\u201cSo, he\u2019s just dealing with a stereotype from his childhood that has no relationship or little relationship with what\u2019s going on right now. And I think what I\u2019m proud of is that the media just called it like it is. If he said \u2014 listen, I only want skills-based people, I only want engineers if they are from Nigeria, if they\u2019re from Norway, I only want engineers. That\u2019s not racist.\n\n\u201cBut when you say the whole country is not welcomed, that is the definition, textbook, of racism. And I\u2019m glad that the media just called him on that. He wasn\u2019t saying, I want skills-based people no matter what color. He said, I want people from this country no matter \u2014 in Norway, no matter how unqualified, and I don\u2019t want anybody from these countries no matter how qualified. That\u2019s the definition of racism. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a discussion of whether media should repeat the word \u201cshithole,\u201d Jones said, \u201cwhat the other thing journalists have to do, though, is to go even deeper and to point out a couple of things. It\u2019s not just African countries are all basket cases and all the African immigrants are just here pulling America down, we just shouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018shithole\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat \u2014 it was not about making the stereotypes a little bit more palatable. It\u2019s about pointing out that African immigrants are coming here in neighborhoods from Oakland to the Bronx, bringing down the crime rate, bringing up the learning rate, bringing up the entrepreneurship and making America great \u2014 same with Haitians and same with El Salvadorians.\n\n\u201cIn other words, this idea that \u2014 well, maybe they really are shithole places, you just shouldn\u2019t say it, and maybe the people who are coming here are not be worthy to be here, that also needs to be challenged based on facts. The educational attainment for African immigrants exceeds the educational attainment for European immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody was aware of that.\n\n\u201cSo, if you want to have the conversation about what\u2019s going to make America great again, let\u2019s have it.\n\n\u201cOne last point I have to make, if you close the door to immigration as severely as Trump wants to, shut it down, you know who gets hurt the most? Trump\u2019s older, white retiring voters who are going to then be living in a country where we\u2019ll be like Japan. We don\u2019t have enough young people in America. We\u2019re going to have a bunch of older people in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need immigration to keep the economy going, so that their retirements can be secure. So, it\u2019s not just racist. It\u2019s not just counter factually. It\u2019s also politically stupid to keep out the younger part of the world that wants to come here and make our economy work.\n\n\u201cThis is just dumb and wrong and racist across the board. Let\u2019s have that conversation, and not only have the conservation about the vulgarism. The vulgarism is just the additional harm to the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Helene Cooper, born in Liberia and now a Pentagon correspondent for the New York Times, said she took Trump\u2019s comments personally.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve crossed the point now as this country when you look at our image abroad, internationally, this country has always been seen as a nation of immigrants,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m one of them coming from Liberia, which I guess would qualify for one of those African countries that President Trump disparaged earlier last week.\n\n\u201cWhat I find really disturbing about this, but just take President Trump aside, because I think this is the sort of thing that we expect from him, but what I find really upsetting about this is that for so many years, I felt like such a proud American. I feel very much like this is my country. But I also feel \u2014 one of the reasons I\u2019ve always felt proud is because this is a country where when my family left Liberia when I was 14 years old, we could have gone anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut I would never have gotten to the point that I got in my life if we had gone somewhere other than the United States. I would never have become a New York Times reporter. It would\u2019ve been a whole lot harder to do what I was able to do here if we had gone to Europe or somewhere like that. And I \u2014 that has always made me proud of this country. That this is a country that you can come to with nothing and you can make something of yourself. And I feel like that \u2014 we\u2019re starting to lose that. And I can\u2019t begin to describe just how upsetting that can be personally, but just how much damage that can do to the United States around the world and how other people look at us.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Juan WIlliams, who was born in Panama, was part of that show\u2019s discussion of Trump\u2019s stance in the immigration policy debate.\n\n\u201cAnd in the lottery system, what he clearly said was, why do we need people from these s-hole countries because right now they\u2019re underrepresented,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd the reason the lottery exists is to make sure that there\u2019s more adequate representation of people who have not been coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModerator Chris Wallace interjected, \u201cAll right, let me \u2014 let me \u2014\u201d\n\nWilliams continued, \u201cAnd he spoke not about the countries when saying that, but about the people who would be included in the lottery.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer.

Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller.

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["designer", "camille", "having", "hero", "natural", "panthers", "meet", "think", "teamsupernatural", "panther", "black", "traditional", "really", "friend", "movie", "hair"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

That said, we realize that not all of you have, so gird your loins, because we\u2019re about to talk Dora Milaje. We\u2019ll try to avoid any spoilers.\n\nBAMorg via YouTube\n\nThe Dora Milaje\u2014Wakandan for \u201cadored ones\u201d\u2014first appeared in 1998, created by Christopher Priest during his tenure as writer of Black Panther. Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

On Sunday he tweeted that he never called the Russian investigation \u201ca hoax\u201d (he most certainly did), and then went on to blame Obama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said \u2018it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u2019 The Russian \u2018hoax\u2019 was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump previously said that he took Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word that the Russians \u201cdidn\u2019t do it\u201d (as if Putin would totally tell him because he asked).\n\n\u201cEvery time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Trump said of the former KGB lieutenant colonel in November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that, he commenced with the Obama bashing, tweeting, \u201cObama did nothing.\u201d\n\nAlso, untrue.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has gone on record saying that Obama should have pushed back against the Russians earlier. But in December 2016, Obama did do something\u2014by sanctioning Russia and seizing compounds used by Russian officials on Long Island in New York and in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, who previously excoriated Schiff when he criticized him, is now quoting him like Kendrick, since the criticism is directed toward the black guy.\n\nThat aside, Schiff asked today why Trump is still doing nothing: The New York Daily News points to a bipartisan sanctions bill Congress passed in July, which the White House has left dead in the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is inexplicable that the president of the United States continues to sit on sanctions that Congress passed, that Congress wants enforced against Russia over this interference,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSo whatchu gonna do, Trump?

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing.

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["president", "obama", "fake", "weak", "trumps", "ukraine", "gop", "look", "russian", "republican", "making", "hawks", "trump", "russia", "russias"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["90s", "id", "butch", "felt", "love", "jones", "living", "wanted", "women", "latifah", "style", "hiphop", "single", "shaped", "way"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt. But it sounded like a bark and his mama named it a bark, so we gonna call it a bark.)\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "start", "wakandan", "need", "bark", "turn", "mbaku", "maybe", "walk", "words", "woof", "problematic", "barking", "speak", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.046005889515817903, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

When I checked it out yesterday, it was sitting at roughly 25 million views on YouTube, and as of today, it\u2019s nearing 30 million. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drake \u201cgot one.\u201d The song is dope on its own, but the video levels shit all the way up.\n\nThe premise is this: The video has a budget of almost a million dollars, so Drake decides to do something meaningful with that budget and gives all of it away to folks in and around Miami. He\u2019s giving out money to folks on the street, at grocery stores, in college. He\u2019s out here buying cars (and hopefully insurance and gas money\u2014them joints weren\u2019t Passats), sending people on shopping sprees and handing literal stacks of cash to folks.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this video. You can choose to look at it as Drake shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings of anybody watching by using his video to paint himself as a sort of hood superman. Much of the video where he\u2019s not giving away money looks to be shot in various hoods of Miami. For those folks he\u2019s handing money to, maybe he\u2019s just temporarily providing a salve when what they might need is actual help (housing, education, etc.) to get and stay out of whatever their situation is.\n\nTemporary help is just that; it\u2019s not changing lives for real. That\u2019s a more cynical view of the video\u2014that Drake is basically pimping fans he\u2019s likely never going to see again for page views and clicks. Shit, he (presumably) didn\u2019t even give away his own money (though somebody still had to pay for that video, which is not shot on anybody\u2019s iPhone).\n\nOn the other hand\u2014this is where I stand\u2014Drake is doing a good deed. A lot of them, actually. And you never know who needs a good deed in their life. Or who is $20 away from being on the street. Or for whom a simple $100 can change everything, or at the very least their week. Money, for the VAST majority of Americans, is a constant struggle. Help is help, however it comes, whenever it comes. I love to see good things happen to people. I love it.\n\nWhen Oprah gives away shit, I love it and I feel happy for the recipients. When Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired, I cried with those folks who got new homes and new leases on life because sometimes, just sometimes, you need some good fortune. Or Undercover Boss, where employees who show up every day and anonymously do their job to the best of their ability are finally seen by the very people signing their checks. When one of those employees gets rewarded, it makes me emotional. I really like to see good things happen to people, especially folks who don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember being surprised when Prince died by how much he did for people. There were stories all over the place, especially in Minneapolis, of folks who had been beneficiaries of Prince\u2019s big heart. Shit, you\u2019d think Prince literally helped out every single person he came into contact with. When Prince died, people happily came out of the woodwork to talk about how generous and thoughtful he was and how he\u2019d do whatever he could to help. And he did it all anonymously. That\u2019s how I like to live my own life. I help people out when I can and it\u2019s because I realize that when you have, it\u2019s a duty to help out those in need to the best of your ability.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about Drake\u2019s video. I honestly don\u2019t care about whose money he gave away or how he got it. I\u2019m just glad he was helping folks who clearly needed it. When he handed those stacks to that young man and his (I assume) mother, and they both broke down crying, I felt like Drake knew that while he was handing out money, he gave them something more valuable. I don\u2019t know how anybody ended up being chosen to receive money, but you could tell after they received something, their days were a little bit better. I was moved to tears several times during the video. And I honestly don\u2019t care if I got pimped for my tears, because that wasn\u2019t fake money he was giving out, and those folks whose lives he touched appreciated it.\n\nWhen people with lots of money and resources realize that they can change folks\u2019 lives with simple gestures (and for rich people, money can be a simple gesture), I gain an appreciation for them because it shows me that they get it. I watched Drake\u2019s video and I felt like Drake \u201cgets it.\u201d He went where he saw a need and alleviated some of it. For that, Drake\u2019s all right with me.", "keywords": ["money", "finally", "plan", "drakes", "gods", "help", "need", "right", "hes", "away", "drake", "folks", "shit", "video", "saw", "good"], "polarity": 0.1969121193134351, "subjectivity": 0.5550141452115135},

The announcements came after many users, including The Root\u2019s Monique Judge, raised hell when Twitter gave a blue check mark to Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who helped plan the pro-Confederacy march in August in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\n\nWhile Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and his workers ruminated on the company\u2019s account-verification policies, I decided it was a good time for black people to pause and think about our relationship with Twitter and other social media and technology companies. We voluntarily \u201ccontribute\u201d our creative insights, dollars and labor to the success of these companies by buying devices and apps, uploading memes, ideas and language that trend widely. Yet in terms of the vast wealth these companies hold, disburse to employees and generate for shareholders, we get little in return.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the recent moment when top lawyers for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, along with Twitter and Facebook, were summoned to Capitol Hill to testify before Senate and House committees looking into the company\u2019s role in disseminating toxic content and ads during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nI shared the congressional investigators\u2019 agita\u2014and the pointed through line of their questioning: How did we get to the point where tech seems to be drowning American democracy? How could the educated, experienced \u201ctechnologists\u201d who built and run these companies have missed the Russians\u2019 insidious gaming of their platforms?\n\nI think there\u2019s one big reason among several that led to the companies\u2019 obliviousness: The tech industry is nearly wholly centered in an exclusionary bubble of white men who finance, develop and market the platforms and applications. The same biases that led to the development of social media startups built on algorithms that enable racial profiling (like NextDoor), or that inform court decisions resulting in blacks and Latinos receiving unduly harsh sentences (like COMPAS), played a role in the Russians\u2019 stealthy misinformation campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-black messaging was the secret sauce of many of the pro-Trump, nationalist memes and messages that flooded through the popular social media channels during the 2016 election cycle. Yet somehow, the gatekeepers at Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t seem to notice the methodical manipulation of racial animus that already exists in America\u2014specifically, some white Americans\u2019 negative opinions of blacks.\n\nThe leaders and staffs of Twitter, Facebook and other popular social media platforms missed the Russians\u2019 exploitation of the black-white divide, an obliviousness that has precedent: Black women who use Twitter had long alerted the platform\u2019s officials to the abusive conduct of other users, up to and including death threats. The hashtag #YourSlipIsShowing catalogs such experiences from black women dating back several years and is readily available ... at least to those interested in learning about and addressing these kinds of user experiences.\n\nBut clearly, the tech-company leaders were not inclined to pay attention to this area of user complaints, a strong indication that they also probably weren\u2019t interested in the views of the few black and Latinx workers at their companies, either. Just look at what happened to Leslie Miley, a black former engineer at Twitter. Miley revealed in a recent interview that he had flagged tons of dubious accounts in 2015, telling his bosses that he believed they were from Ukraine or Russia and that they appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley was told by his bosses at Twitter to \u201cstay in his lane,\u201d a response that Miley says he took as a sign that the company leadership preferred to err on the side of \u201cgrowth numbers\u201d rather than on any potential harm to audiences that the bots might pose.\n\nMeanwhile, black users of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Google products infuse them with a deep coolness factor that resonates around the world. Our intellectual property and creativity is the lifeboat that floats these companies to revenue solvency, yet few of us share in the enormous economic wealth generated by these companies, not even after dozens of news stories, industry conferences and activists\u2019 complaints forced the companies to pledge to improve hiring and retention.\n\n\n\nThe history of black-white tension in America was a major flashpoint manipulated by the GOP during the presidential campaign (not for the first time), and the Russia-controlled bots capitalized on whites\u2019 fears of and disdain for black Americans. This exploitation has been documented by federal investigators, as well as media, including Terrell J. Starr here at The Root and at other news outlets.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the owners, leaders and staffs at the tech companies did not seem to notice or care about the implications of the sneaky manipulation while it happened in real time. The incredible whiteness of their leaderships and staffs is akin to, but far worse than, that of the news industry (which is significant). And the companies\u2019 whiteness is a big reason they missed the infiltration of these divisive messages and tribal calls to action during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nBlack Americans know when something smells rotten, including the kinds of scams and shady b.s. that can unfold at one\u2019s job. And, as usual, blacks and other marginalized communities have solutions. We have the brainpower, problem-solving acumen and moral fortitude to right the ship of state.\n\nThe question is whether our concerns and advice will be heeded and whether we can achieve full access to the genuine levers of power in the United States, including access to quality education, health care, voting and, most importantly in the context of the innovation ecosystem, investment capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you regularly shout out Chance the Rapper or Ava via the \u2019gram, or post your hair-braiding tutorials on YouTube or Amazon.com commercial verticals and cash the resulting PayPal deposits accordingly, you are well within your rights to hold these companies accountable and question the political and economic structures that gave these companies ready access to us, their most valuable cultural assets. Our fixating on the blue check mark of verification should be the least of it.\n\n\n\nWhile there certainly are rough seas and shimmering mirages all around, I do see promise and opportunity in the amazing tech discoveries and innovations that enter the marketplace daily. I also see a future in which blacks and other historically marginalized creators and entrepreneurs more powerfully leverage their advantages in service of owning these technologies.\n\n\n\nRight now we\u2019re swimming in amazing discoveries, yet drowning in age-old belief systems and tribalism that effectively cancel out far-ranging benefits of the powerful machines that increasingly shape our experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is up to us see to it that tech is built and used to positively tell our stories, support our causes and policies, and shape our destinies.", "keywords": ["white", "facebook", "twitter", "companies", "black", "solution", "users", "including", "media", "social", "tech", "whiteness", "techs", "problem"], "polarity": 0.09615543186971759, "subjectivity": 0.40157366443080733},

You have been warned. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, get your life.\n\n1. It was fun watching the postshow special and trying to see myself in the crowd (I didn\u2019t, but I also didn\u2019t watch the whole thing\u2014had to get the babies to sleep and whatnot). The experience of being there and watching the sausage get made was a first for me and highly entertaining, but also I never realized just how scripted those things are to minimize hiccups.\n\nAlso, Oprah just be out there walking around like she don\u2019t own everything we all touched, like she all normal, like it wasn\u2019t her floor. I walked on Oprah\u2019s floor. It\u2019s got to be crazy to be like, \u201cAll this is mine.\u201d I get excited about the plastic cups I own and look at folks crazy for what looks like scheming on them. Neither here nor there, but I just wanted to talk about how awesome the entire experience of being there at OWN was.\n\nOff to the show ...\n\n2. Kofi Siriboe\u2019s ugly-cry game is on a hundred thousand trillion. Listen, over the past, say, four episodes, Siriboe\u2019s acting game has been like, \u201cNothing can stop me\u2014I\u2019m all the way up.\u201d He\u2019s nailed the proper emotion on all of those scenes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last scene when he\u2019s talking to Blue about his name and all that, man, or the opening scene in the last episode where he tells Hollywood to gather the family because he can only say what he has to say once. Or the scene where he and Darla are at the pool. Good gracious. He went for it. She did, too, but he really did. Somebody get that man an award for reaching emotional depths that I\u2019m sure even surprised him. At the very least for taking the art of the ugly cry to new heights. Sheesh. I couldn\u2019t even tell if his eyes were open half the time. That\u2019s talent.\n\n3. Tell me you weren\u2019t afraid something bad happened to Darla. That she was gonna get into a car accident? Or overdose on drugs? Or ANYTHING. Ralph Angel trying to find her was love. He got over himself to be concerned for her safety. He can\u2019t trust her, but that\u2019s Blue\u2019s mama and, even if they can\u2019t be together, the woman he loves.\n\n4. Darla just gon\u2019 up and bounce on Blue without saying bye? Yo no comprende. Where dey do dat at? How, Sway? I want Darla to win so badly because I like her and Ralph Angel together. And I believe they will get it together. I\u2019m not even mad that Blue might not be Ra\u2019s son, but like Ra said, \u201cYou say, \u2018I\u2019m pregnant; it might not be yours.\u2019\u201d Blue is the most important thing to that man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Which is why \u201cBlue is the blood in my veins, even if mine ain\u2019t in his\u201d took me all the way out of there. While there were a few scenes in the finale that seemed a little forced (only a few), they are all forgotten with lines like that. It\u2019s so deep and let Darla (and us) know that Ralph Angel would never stop being that boy\u2019s daddy. I didn\u2019t doubt it, but still ... Mama, there goes that man.\n\n6. I don\u2019t blame Remy for bouncing on Charley. She\u2019s too good at \u201cthe game.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what \u201cthe game\u201d is, but she\u2019s about that shit. Like she said, she\u2019s fueled by negativity (paraphrasing) and I think Remy realized that for Charley, winning her way is more important than the costs. Even when she basically said as much to White Man Boudreau (his name escapes me\u2014you know the one, the one who\u2019s intoxicated by her), I wondered if it was performance or real. I don\u2019t trust Charley, and Remy came to that same conclusion even if he hates it.\n\n7. Can we talk about the music of Queen Sugar for a minute? My Shazam button worked overtime during the course of this show. On last week\u2019s episode, I was introduced to Ngaiire\u2019s song \u201cFall Into My Arms,\u201d which has been on REPEAT (you hear me?) ever since. Good lord, that song speaks to my soul, and its placement was SO perfect. I was introduced to the Francis and the Lights song \u201cMy City Is Gone\u201d (featuring Kanye West) on last night\u2019s finale like, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe whole season has been like that. At this point, I want a one-hour special on the music of Queen Sugar. I\u2019d even host it. You hear that, Oprah?! Let me host it! (We call that \u201cshooting your shot.\u201d) All jokes aside, I\u2019d love to watch that special because the music is as much another character as the land.\n\n8. Y\u2019all, Oprah called herself \u201cthe land\u201d when asked how she might view herself as a character of the show. Game. Set. Match. If LeBron and Oprah don\u2019t do something where they both call themselves \u201cthe Land,\u201d I\u2019ll be disappointed.\n\n9. I love how Queen Sugar has had entirely female directors for the entirety of its existence. The vignette during the postshow where they discussed that made my heart smile. Opportunities in that industry seem to come few and far between unless they\u2019re specifically created, so shouts out to Ava DuVernay for being a creator. And to Oprah because Oprah. You know, the land and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I want to say how much I appreciate this show. So many facets of life, black life specifically, have been addressed with care and nuance that there really is no other show on television like it, nor has there been. That speaks to quality casting and people respecting the material. It also comes from having the ability to be fully black with the work and not have to worry about other folks not getting it or appreciating it.\n\nThe show includes both timely references and current events in a way that is realistic and necessary. Obviously I\u2019m a fan of the show and the actors and the creators, but ultimately I appreciate black art\u2014especially the kind we can all be proud of while participating. Queen Sugar is one of those shows for me, and thank goodness we\u2019re getting more seasons.", "keywords": ["way", "know", "dont", "blue", "thoughts", "darla", "queen", "nights", "say", "finale", "game", "season", "sugar", "oprah"], "polarity": 0.0889686147186147, "subjectivity": 0.5113444216602112},

Which, hopefully, marks the very last time I have to write \u201csperm\u201d and \u201cSean Hannity\u201d in the same sentence, unless it\u2019s \u201cSean Hannity was eaten by a sperm whale?!?!\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the Darth Cheeto himself, who reportedly \u201cjoked\u201d that a friend of Karen McDougal\u2019s\u2014a former Playboy Playmate who claims she had an affair with Trump\u2014liked \u201cthe big black dick.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly is this fascination telling us? I\u2019m not sure. Who knows what lurks in the hearts and loins of peak whiteness? But considering what we know of Donald Trump, it does feel like a bit of projection. Perhaps he hypersexualizes black men because he\u2019s the one out here fucking everyone. He\u2019s the one acting how black men are stereotypically supposed to act. He\u2019s the immoral one who refuses to curtail his sexual urges. He\u2019s the savage.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d bet all the cash in Wakanda that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ain\u2019t the only women he\u2019s slept with while married to Melania. Of course, if two adults consent to sleeping with each other, there\u2019s nothing legally wrong with that, even if one is engaged in an extramarital affair. Morally? Definitely, but it\u2019s not illegal. Perhaps Married Donald is the white Wilt Chamberlain. Or, better yet, Wilt Chamberlain is the black Married Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, he\u2019s just doing what America and white Americans have done since America\u2019s inception, which is do dirt and then claim dark people are inherently dirty.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "black", "married", "hes", "sean", "donald", "women", "wilt", "whos", "theres", "chamberlain", "trump", "sperm", "hannity", "slept"], "polarity": -0.03897849462365592, "subjectivity": 0.4680286738351255},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["chakras", "shahidi", "miranda", "conversations", "noah", "supersoul", "brought", "dont", "apollo", "fears", "aligned", "peele", "shes", "harlems", "oprah"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

This week, Facebook revealed to our parent company, Fusion Media, that Russia-related content ran on two of our sites: Splinter (formerly Fusion) and here at The Root.\n\nEven though Russia is known for having some of the best hackers and bots in the world (I still don\u2019t know what a \u201cbot\u201d is. Is it a robot with an amputated leg? Is it a boy thot?), apparently the Soviet propaganda could only generate side eye from our readers. Even though The Root has 1.2 million followers on Facebook, only a small percentage of the Russian ads made impressions.\n\nFacebook defines \u201cimpressions\u201d as \u201cthe moment an ad enters the screen of a desktop browser or mobile app. If an ad doesn\u2019t enter the screen, we don\u2019t count it as an ad impression.\u201d I haven\u2019t verified the numbers, but I assume only a few thousand of our readers took the Kremlin-backed bait. Hold on, let me check.\n\nOK, I just messaged our social media editor Aarick Knighton. He said only three thousand ... wait. No, just three people? That can\u2019t be right. Let me double-check that figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, just three people saw the Russian ads. Three. That\u2019s it.\n\nWe all know how hard it is for advertisers to reach black audiences, especially when there are white people making the decisions (see SheaMoisture, Pepsi, Dove, et al.). We thought we\u2019d help Facebook, Russia and other advertisers who wanted to reach The Root\u2019s audience by sharing a few ideas that we know would attract attention.\n\n1. Beyonc\u00e9 or Rihanna\n\nIf Facebook ran an ad saying Beyonc\u00e9 was voting for Trump, I\u2019m sure the Beyhive vote would have been worth five or six electoral votes, minimum. Even better, if they had said that every person who pulled the lever for the cantaloupe-colored colluder got a Fenty gift bag, it would have been a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Wypipo\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all The Root\u2019s readers are black. Sometimes Caucasians click on our stories to shed their daily dose of white tears (I\u2019m pretty sure it is a weight-loss technique). And nothing gets the white tears flowing like the word \u201cwypipo.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re selling lotion or Confederate flags. If a headline contains the word, they will click on it.\n\nThen they\u2019ll write the company a letter about how racist their lotion is.\n\n3. Barack and Michelle Obama\n\nLet\u2019s try a quick experiment: Find a random black woman\u2019s Facebook page and scroll through her pictures. I guarantee one of them is a photo of Barack, Michelle or both Obamas. In fact, a 2016 Pew Research poll that was never conducted shows that 83.5 percent of black women\u2019s cellphones have a photograph of the Obamas, only slightly lower than the 94.2 percent who have an unsolicited picture of a penis in their \u201cdeleted photos\u201d folders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Black Lives Matter\n\nLike the word \u201cwypipo,\u201d Caucasians are compelled to click on anything that says #BlackLivesMatter just so they can comment, \u201cShouldn\u2019t all lives matter?\u201d\n\n5. Black Men in Gray Sweatpants\n\nApparently this is a thing women are into. I haven\u2019t done the research, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a big thing now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I think it\u2019s all about things.\n\n6. The Russian Pee Tape\n\nSell it online. I know I\u2019d probably throw up the sweet-and-sour chicken I ate yesterday if I laid eyes on Trump\u2019s bloated, pale, quince-shaped naked body dripping wet with Moscovian-prostitute urine, so I wouldn\u2019t watch it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just want to see the memes on Black Twitter.\n\n7. A Police Officer Convicted of Killing an Unarmed Black Person\n\nOr a unicorn. Or a high-resolution photo of Bigfoot. Or Donald Trump telling the truth. Or Kellyanne Conway combing her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean ... if you want to spread fake news, make it something good.\n\n8. Natural Hair Products\n\nBlack women would click on anything that moisturizes their 3c-grade hair and holds their curl pattern when it rains. I don\u2019t know what any of that means, but they do. Black hair products are proof that the U.S. excludes black women from STEM research because every woman is a Ph.D.-level chemist when it comes to her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Conspiracy Theories\n\nThis is one of the few categories both black and white people can agree on. Anything on the internet is automatically verified as true and will be shared instantly.\n\nI\u2019m sure you saw the Facbook video with the chain-smoking woman talking about the \u201celectric magnet pulse\u201d this weekend. Are you familiar with the pizza-basement sex ring or how Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 traded Blue Ivy\u2019s secret twin to the Illuminati? No?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, you need to read the Willie Lynch letter.\n\nYou gotta stay woke.", "keywords": ["white", "facebook", "page", "sure", "ad", "shouldve", "ran", "tried", "know", "word", "work", "roots", "women", "black", "heres", "russian", "didnt", "click"], "polarity": 0.015495169082125613, "subjectivity": 0.4381188175753393},
{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/hey-y-all-i-met-oprah-here-s-what-happened-1820294380", "title": "/hey-y-all-i-met-oprah-here-s-what-happened-", "text": "A little backstory on how we got to the point where this is even a thing: On Nov. 17, 2016, I wrote a piece called \u201cQueen Sugar Hits This Dad Right in the Feels.\u201d By the end of that day, life was different; anything was possible. The piece published first thing in the morning that day. By 2 p.m., I received a call from Oprah Winfrey\u2014you\u2019ve probably heard of her\u2014telling me that she\u2019d read and loved the piece and even teared up reading about my reaction to the scene at the heart of the article. I documented that experience here.\n\nListen, life is different once stuff like that happens to you. It just is. Especially because those are the types of experiences you get to share with people. I didn\u2019t answer the call because of the \u201cUnknown\u201d caller-ID tag, and it allowed me to have a voicemail that I can still play for folks. Oprah called me, but she really called everybody I know that day.\n\nI have played that voicemail for classes of students. I\u2019ve played it for people I see on the street who recognize me and ask me to hear it. That was a win for everybody who tries to do anything creative and wonders if anybody notices. Turns out, yes, people can and do notice. And sometimes people is even Oprah.\n\nIn April of this year, the HBO original movie The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks starring Oprah Winfrey was released. I had the fortune of attending a screening at the Blacksonian, and Oprah was there. I got really close to her, too\u2014close enough to try to stop her and tell her that she called me and take a picture with her, but it didn\u2019t seem like the right time to do that, so I let it ride. I figured, life has been semicharmed to this point, and God seems to be looking out more than I might deserve\u2014I\u2019ll probably see her again and get a chance to tell her and take a picture with her. Oh, what a friend we have in Jesus.\n\nQueen Sugar was then and remains one of my favorite shows, so on occasion I write about it. I recently wrote about how Queen Sugar was coming for all of the feelings that This Is Us typically draws out of me. The piece published in the morning, and in the afternoon I got an email from OWN saying that they loved the piece and oh, by the way, they\u2019re taping a season-finale postshow discussion in Hollywood on Nov. 7 moderated by Oprah featuring Ava DuVernay and the cast, and would I like to come because they\u2019ll cover everything?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruh. Here\u2019s where the shit gets beautiful. Damon and I were already going to be in the Bay Area for a speaking engagement at Stanford University on Nov. 6. It\u2019s a quick flight to Los Angeles for Nov. 7! Perfecto. Siiiiiiign me up. The postshow taping was great, and the OWN building is awesome. I love L.A., and I love being on studio lots. It feels so Hollywood and I love everything about it. We got to see how the sausage gets made, and the convo was cute and fun. Oprah said one thing that had the entire audience\u2019s mind blown\u2014check that out on Nov. 15 after the season finale.\n\nWhere the fun happens is the postshow after-party, which was at Soho House. I\u2019m guessing this is an exclusive-ass place because just to get to the \u201cgarden,\u201d we had to walk through a long hallway that looked like some Prohibition-era get-to-the-booze-and-gambling entryway. Shit was glamorous, b. I felt glamorous. Me and you, your mama and your cousin, too, felt glamorous.\n\nWe (les journos) got there first, which gave us the opportunity to take a bunch of pictures of places famous folks hang. I think the first celeb from Queen Sugar to show up was Bianca Lawson (Darla), and she started taking pictures with folks immediately. She was very sweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll say about the cast members that we met\u2014everybody was super cool, willing to talk to you and mad down to earth. It\u2019s always amazing to me how small folks are in real life compared with how they look on camera. Rutina Wesley (Nova) is an itty-bitty thang. She\u2019s adorbs. Also, Kofi Siriboe is a good-looking man. Like, I\u2019m not sure how else to say that. He just is a good-looking dude. Even in the picture I took with him, I was like, \u201cWell, this is the picture NOBODY will care that I\u2019m in.\u201d He laughed.\n\nI also talked to his mother for a bit, seeing as she\u2019s Ghanaian and my woman is Ghanaian, and I have a son also called Kofi (one of his middle names, anyway). She\u2019s a super-sweet woman, and she had such a great spirit and vibe. I love black mamas.\n\nOf course, when Oprah walks into the room, she has this gravity about her. She comes in just as cool as a cucumber and starts talking to people. Now, when you\u2019re LOOKING to meet and talk to somebody, especially not quite as famous as Jesus but, like, No. 4 or 5 on that list, you try to figure out the approach. Me? I had nothing. I don\u2019t think any of us did, honestly. Then she went to the one place where I\u2019m always at home and can find a reason to talk to anybody: the bar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd NOBODY was standing next to her on her right. Like, there goes Oprah just being Oprah and her whole right side is free? So I did what any self-respecting person would do ... I sidled up to her and prepared to launch into a \u201cHey, I noticed you noticing me, and I wanted to put you on notice that I noticed you, too.\u201d Then I realized that she was ordering a drink, and my soul was like, \u201cDog, you HAVE to know what Oprah is drinking.\u201d So I just asked, \u201cAnd what exactly are YOU drinking?\u201d\n\nDo you know this turned into an entire convo about tequila? Oprah is a tequila drinker. We had an entire convo about her palate for tequila and how she has a favorite, Casa Dragones, and how she\u2019s traveled the world in search of just the right taste for her. She told us how smooth it is and mentioned George Clooney\u2019s tequila. I had just ordered my standard Bulleit and ginger ale (all drinks were free, bee tee dubs) so I just tasted it while everyone else ordered what she was having. Oprah then proceeded to toast with us all, because Oprah apparently is about that celebrating-life life.\n\nBut because she\u2019s Oprah, she ALSO proceeded to listen to us talk about finding passion in life and doing what you love. She actually had real inspirational conversations with my fellow journos about them deciding to write and be creatives for a living and how God puts those options in your life or puts the word there until you can\u2019t deny it. That woman spoke of how you have to follow your heart\u2014you know, the kind of stuff we all need to hear, but it carries weight coming from somebody who made it to the top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI stepped in and asked for a picture with her. Before we took the picture, I told her that I was Panama Jackson from VSB and that she called and left me a voicemail after I wrote an article about the show and how I sent it to all my family and friends and how it lit up so many folks\u2019 day and we were so excited and thankful for that and that she\u2019s awesome. And she looked me dead in my face and said: \u201cTHAT WAS YOU! It was such a good piece, and I loved the way you captured exactly what we were trying to convey. Thank you so much! It was such a good and well-written piece!\u201d\n\nThen she high-fived me and pulled me in for a picture, and I\u2019m pretty sure my heart sang a song of sixpence. My face touched her face, and then I smiled the biggest smile ever as the camera snapped. She was so nice about it and so pleasant and sweet. Oprah invited me (sure, it was folks from OWN, but she owns OWN, so I\u2019m looking at it like Oprah invited me, dammit) to hang out with her and Ava and the cast of Queen Sugar, and told me she remembered the piece I wrote and toasted with the homies all of the free drinks we could drink. I got to say, that day was a good day. She was handing out hugs, words, tequila and good vibes. She\u2019s good with me, b. Always.\n\nEvents like this and being invited to go to stuff like this with famous people who are paying attention to what we\u2019re doing is humbling and still inspires me at times. There\u2019s nothing like being yourself and finding out that other people can appreciate it. Some of those people can change everything for you or give you enough of an energy boost to keep going. Again, you never know who that will be.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all of you folks who are out there trying to find your next idea or creative endeavor, please, please, please keep on keeping on. You really have no idea where any of this can take you. Everybody ain\u2019t gonna get to the top\u2014this is fact. But why can\u2019t that person who does make it be you? Never forget that. Seriously.\n\nEnjoy the ride and realize that inspiration and success\u2014whatever that looks like for you\u2014don\u2019t have to miss you. Figure out what your success is, and then prepare for your actual success to look way different than you thought. Just don\u2019t stop, fam. At all. Oprah (or whoever matters to you) might be paying attention.\n\nOne last thing: We met Oprah, y\u2019all. Because without VSB and the folks who come here and read and keep us inspired, I\u2019d never be in the position to write about something I enjoy that could end up in front of Oprah. From my mind to Oprah\u2019s eyes has been a long journey, but I\u2019m glad I got to take it.

She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup.

Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross.

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock! Awards in New York\u2014you will walk the red carpet alongside stars and have VIP seating to watch the entire show with some of the hottest celebs!\n\n\n\nNot in the market for some of the bigger-ticket items in the auction? EBay for Charity and Black Girls Rock! also partnered with fashion-accessory brand Pintrill to create exclusive enamel pins that are being sold on the platform throughout February. One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

Because both suspects are rich white men (even though their riches are now up for question), both sides agreed that a home detention would be adequate, according to Fox News.\n\nUpdated Monday, Oct. 30, 2017, 11:05 a.m. EDT: Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s business associate, are facing multiple charges that include \u201cconspiracy against the United States,\u201d \u201cconspiracy to launder money,\u201d \u201cunregistered agent of a foreign principal,\u201d \u201cfailure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts\u201d and \u201cfalse statements.\u201d\n\nAccording to NPR, both men are expected in court in Washington, D.C., by Monday afternoon in what marks the first major public action by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is really showing his hand and making it known that he is not here to play games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Monday-morning buzz, it was also revealed that former campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI throughout the Mueller probe.\n\nCourt documents claim that Papadopoulos had extensive contact with people who were known to be connected to the Russian government, including one individual who apparently told him that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Manafort and Gates turned themselves over to the FBI on Monday; however, Papadopoulos\u2019 status remains unclear, according to NPR.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump is still doing what Trump does best\u2014tweeting instead of managing the country\u2014and he claimed Monday that whatever Manafort is up against concerns things that happened \u201cyears ago\u201d before he joined the Trump campaign.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss?

If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["know", "heart", "american", "thats", "love", "didnt", "jones", "marriage", "man", "tayari", "novel", "matter", "gets", "book"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

Not only did Donald Trump become president, but he went about shoring up white supremacy as swiftly as possible.\n\nUnder his leadership, hate groups have grown and protections for marginalized people have been eagerly dismantled by the administration. And people of color, women and anyone who can be identified as \u201cother\u201d on a census form became even more obvious targets of overt prejudice, racist violence and blatant sexism.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. A February American Psychological Association poll found that 57 percent of Americans feel \u201csignificant stress\u201d thanks to today\u2019s political climate. We\u2019re also more anxious, more restless and extra sensitive in familiar surroundings. It\u2019s like we\u2019re drifting away on a wave of sadness.\n\nBut there might be an antidote to this languishing emotional recession.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that supporting and encouraging women of color to start their own businesses can give all of us a jolt of new energy and help us slow the descent into the psychological black hole that is the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay with me.\n\nWe need women of color to start their own businesses\u2014en masse\u2014for a few reasons. First, the rest of us can go work for them! (Explaining why that would be beneficial requires its own article.) The rest of us can support their creativity while experiencing what it\u2019s like to be valued and respected. We\u2019d also get a collective break from white supremacy at work (pun intended).\n\nAnd right now, we need a break.\n\nIn 2017 we\u2019re going to therapy more, with online therapy company TalkSpace reporting a jump in new patients this year, especially among people targeted by Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric. We\u2019re also self-medicating more, as evidenced by the spike in drinking among women of color and other groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also face the fact that under Trump, women of color probably encounter even greater obstacles in getting promoted and earning what they\u2019re worth in traditional work environments. Trump governs by toxic masculinity and white supremacy. And he is taking a sledgehammer to opportunity and protective programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Title IX and Obama-era measures that would require companies to disclose how much they pay workers in order to address the gender pay gap.\n\nAccording to the research group Catalyst, women of color often lack the support (pdf) needed to move up the ranks in their workplace. They also face challenges for \u201csticking out\u201d and in trying to \u201cblend in.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[b]ecause corporate environments typically do not reflect the behavioral norms common to the cultural backgrounds of women of color, these women may have to go to great lengths to adjust to the corporate environment and to network effectively.\u201d\n\nSo the rest of us have to step up and support women of color so that they can work in environments that utilize skills, perspectives and experiences that are not always fully expressed or nurtured in white-dominant workplaces. Two words: Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visionary filmmaker recently explained that instead of trying to break the glass ceiling, she is focused on \u201cbuilding my own house.\u201d\n\nWe need more Ava DuVernays. And Shonda Rhimeses. And Issa Raes. And Maria Hinojosas. But the rest of us have to put in work so that these gifted women among us can start their own enterprises\u2014to maximize and monetize their talents and possibilities\u2014and set the country on a better path as we prepare to become a majority-minority country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, women of color have already mastered so many of the requisite skills. From their work leading extended intergenerational families to organizing PTAs and church groups and running informal beauty and catering businesses from home, women of color have the human resources acumen to run successful enterprises and to empower employees to do their best work. They delegate, supervise and orchestrate major events like weddings, annual family gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras and large Greek-life gatherings.\n\nFrom these private and public experiences, women of color also emerge with a hard-won emotional intelligence, which a recent study shows is already more abundant in women. Experience shows that women of color have borne the burden of being de facto social workers, group therapists and conflict mitigators at work and school whenever racial tensions and intersectional misunderstandings flare up. The rest of us need to make sure they capitalize on those so-called soft skills.\n\nWe can start supporting women of color right now.\n\nPatronize their online stores and brick-and-mortar restaurants. Support their crowdfunding campaigns. Hire them for corporate projects. Donate to their nonprofits and join as volunteers. Buy their books, artwork and clothing lines. There are many opportunities in our daily lives to be intentional about finding and supporting a woman of color.

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10. The fact that her name is Belen Aldecosea, but what happened is so white that for now on I\u2019m just going to call her Kirstjen Nielsen.", "keywords": ["airport", "bring", "whitest", "levels", "things", "im", "gotdamn", "plane", "toilet", "fact", "hamster", "whiteness", "shes", "told", "woman", "emotionalsupport", "flushed"], "polarity": 0.0061110247776914465, "subjectivity": 0.533083916083916},

Ads were purchased that referenced Black Lives Matter and specifically targeted people in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore.\n\nBoth Ferguson and Baltimore were the sites of widespread civil unrest and protests after high-profile killings of black men by police. CNN reports that the Internet Research Agency used that information to purchase geographically targeted advertising meant to sow political chaos in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile a senior spokesman from the Kremlin said last week that Russia did not buy ads on Facebook to influence the election, the Internet Research Agency is described as \u201ca state-funded organization that blogs and tweets on behalf of the Kremlin,\u201d according to CNN. Facebook says the agency purchased 3,000 ads, roughly a quarter of which were geographically targeted.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter ad that was purchased appeared on Facebook sometime between late 2015 and early 2016, CNN reports. Sources told CNN that the ad could be seen as both supporting Black Lives Matter and representing it as a threat to some residents of Ferguson and Baltimore.\n\nWhile the ads did not necessarily promote one candidate or cause over another, it appears that the goal was to amplify political discord and create a general atmosphere of incivility and chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement earlier this month, Facebook\u2019s chief security officer said: \u201cThe vast majority of ads run by these accounts didn\u2019t specifically reference the U.S. presidential election, voting or a particular candidate.

On Thursday, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 election, including any on Russian interference.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Sessions held a press conference Thursday to announce his recusal, and the Post was kind enough to provide us with an annotated transcript that highlights what Sessions said to the press and also provides applicable references to questions asked during the confirmation hearing, as well as references to where Sessions may have later contradicted himself or backpedaled on his statements.\n\nWhat is on display in this transcript is an amazing feat of legal contortion.\n\nWhile it is a good thing that Sessions recused himself, let\u2019s not break our hands applauding him. He needs to resign. He is yet another member of this administration who has proved himself to be dishonest, and because of his position as U.S. attorney general, his actions and lies are especially egregious.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that everyone is foaming at the mouth about allegations that he had conversations and dealings with Russia, but was otherwise silent about him being a racist pushing an agenda that will have a direct negative impact on people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who may not have time to click through, some of the highlights are included below. All quotes are directly from the Washington Post.\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\nFirst, about the comments that I made to the committee that have been said to be incorrect and false, let me be clear. I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nThat \u201cabout the Trump campaign\u201d clause is the key qualifier here. Sessions said in sworn testimony during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d The question involved the campaign, but he wasn\u2019t asked directly whether he spoke with Russia ABOUT the campaign. Sessions also said The Washington Post\u2019s report Wednesday night was \u201cfalse\u201d even though the report didn\u2019t alleged he had spoken about the campaign with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\n[T]he idea that I was part of a quote, \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government is totally false.\n\nPost notes:\n\nThis quote is from Sen. Al Franken\u2019s (D-Minn.) question to Sessions, which elicited Sessions\u2019s denial. But Franken didn\u2019t ask Sessions whether he was part of the \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign. He said that phrase while summarizing a news report and then asked Sessions, \u201cif there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions\u2019s argument is basically that he understood\u2014and perhaps misunderstood\u2014this question to be only talking about the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\n\n\n[M]y reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time.\n\nPost notes:\n\n\u201cAs I understood it at the time\u201d is an interesting phrase. It seems to allow Sessions, if he needs to, to say that he misunderstood the question. That could help him if he ever were to face a perjury charge\u2014which, we should note, there is no evidence of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\nIn fact, on Monday of this week, we set a meeting with an eye to a final decision on this question. And on Monday, we set that meeting today. So this was a day that we planned to have a final discussion about handling this. I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nSessions says he will recuse himself from matters involving the Trump campaign\u2014but also makes clear that it was a decision that predated the current controversy. This allows him to claim he\u2019s not admitting fault.\n\nIt goes on and on. I highly encourage you to take the time to click through and read the transcript along with the Post\u2019s notes, because what Sessions did during the press conference was the most fabulous display of legal acrobatics that I have seen in quite some time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["lawyer", "recuses", "doubletalk", "question", "inquiry", "press", "sessions", "asked", "displays", "trump", "report", "transcript", "jeff", "russian", "washington", "campaign", "russia", "skills"], "polarity": 0.12680851063829787, "subjectivity": 0.48185410334346496},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1.

The Patriots, however, have 952 of them.\n\nThis cannot be a coincidence. It just can\u2019t. If you ordered a pepperoni pizza for a party and you opened the box and saw that one slice had 95 pepperonis while the other seven slices had five total, you\u2019d suspect something was up\u2014that the pizza-maker wanted one person to have all the pepperoni. You don\u2019t know why the pizza-maker made this arbitrarily specific decision, but you know a decision was made. SOMEONE IN NEW ENGLAND IS MAKING THE DECISION TO REFRESH THE BATTERIES FOR THE WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, when you have an unusual number of white players on a team\u2014football and basketball particularly\u2014the way they\u2019re talked about changes. Words like \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d find their way into the columns and comments and news stories about them. They\u2019re \u201cgood locker-room guys\u201d and \u201ccoaches on the field.\u201d They \u201chustle\u201d and they possess an unlimited amount of \u201cguile\u201d and \u201ctoughness.\u201d Their \u201cwork ethics\u201d are impeccable because they\u2019re true \u201cstudents of the game.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Gronkowski is basically white LeBron. And by \u201cwhite LeBron\u201d I mean \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d Or that Danny Woodhead ran a 4.3-second 40. If they\u2019re white athletes, they\u2019re succeeding because of their smarts and their character.\n\nSo yes. Hate away. Hate to your heart\u2019s content.

On Thursday, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 election, including any on Russian interference.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Sessions held a press conference Thursday to announce his recusal, and the Post was kind enough to provide us with an annotated transcript that highlights what Sessions said to the press and also provides applicable references to questions asked during the confirmation hearing, as well as references to where Sessions may have later contradicted himself or backpedaled on his statements.\n\nWhat is on display in this transcript is an amazing feat of legal contortion.\n\nWhile it is a good thing that Sessions recused himself, let\u2019s not break our hands applauding him. He needs to resign. He is yet another member of this administration who has proved himself to be dishonest, and because of his position as U.S. attorney general, his actions and lies are especially egregious.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that everyone is foaming at the mouth about allegations that he had conversations and dealings with Russia, but was otherwise silent about him being a racist pushing an agenda that will have a direct negative impact on people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who may not have time to click through, some of the highlights are included below. All quotes are directly from the Washington Post.\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\nFirst, about the comments that I made to the committee that have been said to be incorrect and false, let me be clear. I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nThat \u201cabout the Trump campaign\u201d clause is the key qualifier here. Sessions said in sworn testimony during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d The question involved the campaign, but he wasn\u2019t asked directly whether he spoke with Russia ABOUT the campaign. Sessions also said The Washington Post\u2019s report Wednesday night was \u201cfalse\u201d even though the report didn\u2019t alleged he had spoken about the campaign with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions:\n\n[T]he idea that I was part of a quote, \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government is totally false.\n\nPost notes:\n\nThis quote is from Sen. Al Franken\u2019s (D-Minn.) question to Sessions, which elicited Sessions\u2019s denial. But Franken didn\u2019t ask Sessions whether he was part of the \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d during the campaign. He said that phrase while summarizing a news report and then asked Sessions, \u201cif there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions\u2019s argument is basically that he understood\u2014and perhaps misunderstood\u2014this question to be only talking about the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\n\n\n[M]y reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time.\n\nPost notes:\n\n\u201cAs I understood it at the time\u201d is an interesting phrase. It seems to allow Sessions, if he needs to, to say that he misunderstood the question. That could help him if he ever were to face a perjury charge\u2014which, we should note, there is no evidence of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions:\n\nIn fact, on Monday of this week, we set a meeting with an eye to a final decision on this question. And on Monday, we set that meeting today. So this was a day that we planned to have a final discussion about handling this. I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost notes:\n\n\n\nSessions says he will recuse himself from matters involving the Trump campaign\u2014but also makes clear that it was a decision that predated the current controversy. This allows him to claim he\u2019s not admitting fault.\n\nIt goes on and on. I highly encourage you to take the time to click through and read the transcript along with the Post\u2019s notes, because what Sessions did during the press conference was the most fabulous display of legal acrobatics that I have seen in quite some time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["lawyer", "recuses", "doubletalk", "question", "inquiry", "press", "sessions", "asked", "displays", "trump", "report", "transcript", "jeff", "russian", "washington", "campaign", "russia", "skills"], "polarity": 0.12680851063829787, "subjectivity": 0.48185410334346496},

It\u2019s easily one of the most compelling shows on television, and probably the only justification for why I see Farmers Only commercials on black television networks.\n\nI won\u2019t call it the best show on television, since I\u2019ve seen exactly half of one episode of Game of Thrones and people have GoT watch parties and there are meme generators dedicated to it. People seem to feel really strongly about GoT.\n\n\n\nPoint is, it\u2019s a great show, but I won\u2019t fight about what show is the best on television, since I\u2019m not up on all of the most popular shows.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand (Queen Sugar): For years a common complaint in the black community was that we lacked diversity in the form of television shows that catered to the black experience; Queen Sugar looks that complaint right in the face and slaps the taste out of its mouth. It\u2019s a good show, y\u2019all, and I\u2019m gonna learn you something today in case you ain\u2019t up on game. Here are 10 reasons you should absolutely be watching Queen Sugar right now.\n\n1. In what seemed like a herculean feat, the show leveled up in its currently running second season (we just reached that annoying midseason finale point last night) of life with the Bordelon family. For those not in the know, we\u2019re taking a look at the Bordelons, a complex family unit where the patriarch\u2019s death leads to the eventual (I\u2019m skipping everything) opening of the Queen Sugar Mill, whose express purpose is seeing to the needs of black farmers in fictional St. Josephine, La. My concern after season 1 was that they might have given it everything they had. I was wrong. I apologize\u2014believe me, I do. I shan\u2019t worry any longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. There are three Bordelon kids: Nova is the oldest, Charley is the love child in the middle, and Ralph Angel is the youngest and only boy. You could NOT come up with three more different siblings. Nova is basically Black Lives Matter in the flesh, except our first foray into her life includes her relationship with a married white police officer. Say heifer, say what? Yeah, girl, you heard me right!\n\nCharley is the wife of an NBA All-Star and champion and is the brains behind their whole family operation until it all goes to the left, to the left. Then there\u2019s Ralph Angel, a walking, talking good intention who is trying to get his life together after a stint in jail.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: He\u2019s got a son named Blue (more on him later) with a former addict, Darla. Somehow HE\u2019S the stable one in that parental construct and has \u201ccustody\u201d of their son. Bruh. What? Why does this rate as a reason you should watch? Here\u2019s why: In three siblings, we literally hit so many cross sections of the black community. We\u2019ve got a basketball wife (no tomfoolery, though), an activist with some inconsistencies and a reformed felon ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... and there\u2019s a farm involved.\n\n3. Charley is probably the most curious character on the show even though I enjoy her the least. She\u2019s a woman who is in total control\u2014if you let the liquor tell it\u2014whose world was upended by her philandering soon-to-be ex-husband (the NBA star), Davis, and it sends her into a personal fact-finding mission where she becomes, effectively, Queen Sugar.\n\nCharley is on her shit, full stop, in almost every way. She\u2019s always a step ahead and always handling business. Until we start to see the chinks in her armor in the second season and she becomes more human\u2014to me at least. Who she really is starts to unfold, and it\u2019s powerful. The last two episodes ... actually, we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I want Ralph Angel to win because as a character, he\u2019s so interesting. He\u2019s got a lot of pride, and it all makes sense. He\u2019s doing everything he can to be a better man and be the best man he can for his son, Blue. The introduction of Blue\u2019s black Barbie doll, Kenya, adds additional layers to who Ralph Angel is, since he is fiercely protective of his son\u2019s innocence and kinship with this doll.\n\nWe come to find out that Ralph Angel has long been accepting and understanding as a man and is not confined by gender roles or norms. Talk about curveballs. This show has them. What makes that awesome is that the show does not make a huge thing about Kenya, though it\u2019s clearly coming. Kenya ain\u2019t got no lines, but she\u2019s getting more screen time as the show progresses. Point is, on a black television show about black farmers, we have a young boy named Blue who is playing with Barbie dolls and his masculine-as-hell ex-con father is entirely accepting and supportive of him. Where dey do dat at?\n\n5. Can we talk about the music for a minute? I think we can. The music supervisors on this show are TRYING to make you kill your phone\u2019s battery as you set your Shazam to \u201cauto\u201d so it can catch every song. I have actually stood up and clapped at the television screen several times every episode once because of the music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Charley and Davis have a son named Micah who got swept up into their shenanigans, got uprooted from Los Angeles to St. Josephine and has been having a time of it. Well, in this second season, they pulled national storylines into the show regarding police brutality. I won\u2019t give anything away, but last night\u2019s midseason finale\u2014GOOD LORD, I ALMOST LOST ALL OF MY MARBLES.\n\nA running storyline is finding out what happened to Micah when the police took him to jail for driving while black. Last night we found out, and man ... I have no idea how I\u2019d handle that if my son were relaying the story they had him tell. It reminded me of the movie Daddy\u2019s Little Girls when Idris\u2019 character\u2019s daughters show up at 2 a.m. and he finds out that his ex-wife\u2019s new boyfriend put his hands on them. He felt helpless (because felon), and that\u2019s a fear I have: something happening to my children where I feel helpless about my ability to fix it and take away the pain. Those scenes make me boo-hoo, and I don\u2019t care who is watching. It was the one moment on the show where I\u2019ve felt bad for Davis.\n\n7. The last two episodes of this season so far have been some of the most emotionally draining of any show I\u2019ve watched in a while. Now, they aren\u2019t This Is Us-level emo\u2014I don\u2019t think I could handle that\u2014but the family gets upended by some news that sends each of the siblings down different paths as they try to put the pieces of the family together. I\u2019m not saying jump right into those episodes. I am saying that if you want to see some compelling storytelling, the last two episodes are your huckleberry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Aunt Violet is probably the true heart and soul of the show. She\u2019s the glue. Aunt Vi keeps the peace and is the one they all rely on. I love me some Aunt Vi. You will, too, if you don\u2019t already. She\u2019s one of those role players who do their job and do it well, and you\u2019re happy they\u2019re present at all times.\n\n9. Hollywood. I just like Hollywood. He and Aunt Vi really love each other, and he made some BIG mistakes, but when she thought he died and he hadn\u2019t died, lawd\u2014those emotions were real as I sat on my bouch and cried for their love. I just like Hollywood, man. He\u2019s good for Vi and she\u2019s good for him. Surprisingly, he\u2019s from Atlanta. He\u2019s probably got the closest to an accent you\u2019d expect from down there, since nobody else is even really trying. Except Ralph Angel, bless his heart.\n\n10.

I know I could be crucified for saying that, because I\u2019m supposed to be on the purple team or the green team. I\u2019m not trying to rebel against what everybody\u2019s saying, but maybe I want to measure it. Somebody will call me and ask me to come to a march because such and such got shot. In that situation I want to know what really happened. I\u2019m not going to jump up and go march just because I\u2019m green and the person who got shot is green.

No one\u2019s asking Badu to dive into groupthink, but she\u2019s starting to sound like a Hotep Trump, who once claimed that tiki-torch-wielding white nationalists were good people.\n\n\n\nBadu\u2019s brand of humanity is a conundrum, to say the least. She believes in the good in everyone (even Hitler, and I\u2019m not using \u201cHitler\u201d metaphorically; she literally believes that there is good in Hitler\u2014Hitler!: \u201cHitler was a wonderful painter\u201d) and uses empathy to help guide her as a person in the world. It all sounds beautiful and cultlike, but unfortunately, humanity doesn\u2019t work like that. At least it didn\u2019t when Hitler slaughtered much of the Jewish population in Europe. No one cares about how awesome a painter Hitler was (or wasn\u2019t) when he designed his life around being a spawn of Satan.\n\nIt\u2019s like news outlets running headlines on the Las Vegas Strip shooter, Stephen Paddock, being a country music fan. Or Charleston, S.C., church killer Dylann Roof being a troubled teen. No one cares about the human details of their lives when their endgame was to take out as many lives as they could. I don\u2019t want to compare murder to rape here, but both are horrible crimes against humanity, and unless you\u2019re the mother of Cosby, Paddock or Roof, you shouldn\u2019t give much consideration to these people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important not to separate people like Cosby and XXXTentacion from the art they create. When we support art from problematic and predatory people, we are putting money in their pockets. And money is powerful because there are people around these problematic figures who are just trying to make a living and are often not holding them accountable. But we have to remember, when we support artists whose beliefs don\u2019t align with ours, we\u2019re as complicit as they are.\n\nThe Vulture writer, Marchese, like us, was just trying to understand Badu and her controversial opinions and said: \u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to accept that you might be operating on a higher moral plane than I am, but I think going down the route of \u2018Hitler was a child once too\u2019 is maybe turning the idea of empathy into an empty abstraction.\u201d\n\nDing, ding, ding!\n\nLater in the interview, as the writer continues to try to understand her point of view, Badu says:\n\nWe are all living in a cognitive-dissonance reality. We want to live a certain way or do a certain thing, and we don\u2019t because we are emotionally attached to how the group thinks. The hive mentality takes over. But you know what\u2019s right in your mind and your heart, and if you\u2019re strong enough to detach from the hive then sometimes, just sometimes, you may be able to do the right thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I guess there\u2019s that?\n\nIn response to the backlash to the article, Badu tweeted that she was open to the dialogue, but it seems that she doesn\u2019t like it when black and Jewish folks deem her problematic opinions problematic because we use the word \u201cproblematic\u201d too much:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSis, maybe you\u2019re problematic too much.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted this response to the Vulture article:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn two other tweets, Greenblatt went in on the Hitler comment:\n\nI also like to think that there is good in all people, but Hitler is pure evil. I don\u2019t care if he painted or was a vegetarian; Hitler is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews & a war that claimed the lives of tens of millions. Shame on you for downplaying that. You are a role model to many, and as such, you should immediately apologize for these irresponsible and misguided comments.\n\nIn case you want to read the interview, spoiler alert: Badu\u2019s next album may be a series of moans and hums; she sits at the bedsides of dying people as a hobby (which actually seems like a pretty relaxing way to go, with Badu at your bedside); her favorite response is, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d; and she and Common took an illegal trip to Cuba. This story was probably the best thing about the interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo go forth and educate yourself on the very different vibrations of Erykah Badu.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to include Badu\u2019s tweet and the ADL\u2019s response to the Vulture article.", "keywords": ["conversation", "cosby", "response", "badu", "im", "know", "dont", "youre", "dabbles", "hotepery", "hitler", "problematic", "erykah", "wonder", "think"], "polarity": 0.05737578914141415, "subjectivity": 0.5341888888888889},

The Times reports that this confrontation took place in June, only weeks after Mueller was hired.\n\nEven though the New York Times has done a great job reporting this, The Root has obtained an unofficial transcript of the conversation between McGahn and Trump. We present to you: Robert Mueller\u2019s Day Off.\n\nDonald Trump: Hello, Mr. McGahn, I think we need to have a serious talk.\n\nDonald McGahn: Sure, sir. What would you like to talk about?\n\nDT: I\u2019m going to need you to do two things for me today. I need for you to change your name and fire Robert Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: What? That\u2019s a terrible idea!\n\nDT: No, it isn\u2019t. You don\u2019t deserve a tremendously spectacular name like Donald. I don\u2019t want people getting us confused. Plus, if you\u2019re going to be my lawyer, I only hire Jewish attorneys. I\u2019ve settled hundreds of pussy-grabbing cases with them, so you\u2019re going to have to change your name to something more Jewish, like ...\n\nDM: Wait ... I\u2019m talking about the Robert Mueller thing. You can\u2019t fire Robert Mueller!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDT: Why not?\n\nDM: Because he\u2019s investigating you for obstruction of justice! It would set off so many alarms. It could cause a constitutional crisis and even jump-start impeachment proceedings! Why would you want to fire him?\n\nDT: To obstruct justice. \u201cObstruct\u201d means stop, right? Sometimes when I\u2019m trying to slip Ivanka some tongue, her big teeth obstruct me, so I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what it means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: But why would you want to fire him?\n\nDT: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but it\u2019s kinda the only thing I\u2019m good at now that my arthritis is obstructing my vagina grabbing. See? I used that word again, hee-hee.\n\nDM: Well, I\u2019m not doing that. It would be terrible for you, legally speaking.\n\nDT: That\u2019s what they said about me not releasing my taxes ...\n\nDM: But this is different.\n\nDT: ... And rigging the election ...\n\nDM: But he\u2019s investigating that\u2014\n\nDT: ... And hiring a spy to sit on my security council ...\n\nDM: Well, Michael Flynn is going to jail\u2014\n\nDT: ...

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

News broke Tuesday that Mueller seems to really be digging into the idea that the president attempted to obstruct the investigation on multiple occasions, but that doesn\u2019t bother Big Donnie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he is reported to have said.\n\nMe too, Big Donnie.\n\nI think it should be broadcast around the world so that we can all be watching at the moment his addled-brain ass goes completely off script and starts volunteering information that Mueller didn\u2019t even ask for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know how he likes to brag about himself. Please, let him tell us how he outsmarted everyone by firing Michael Flynn, firing James Comey and punking Jeff Sessions into a stunned silence.\n\nWe want to know.\n\nListen. You wouldn\u2019t even have to charge a lot of money to make big money off this event because everyone would want to watch. This would probably be the one and only pay-per-view event that everyone would watch legally instead of through bootleg methods because the price would be worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you listening to me, Cox Communications?

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["white", "mother", "magical", "mr", "negro", "negrod", "charlie", "does", "shit", "church", "magically", "movie", "reasons"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

The Times reports that this confrontation took place in June, only weeks after Mueller was hired.\n\nEven though the New York Times has done a great job reporting this, The Root has obtained an unofficial transcript of the conversation between McGahn and Trump.

Solange did the absolute most, impressing us with African-inspired avant-garde hairstyles. Then there was Erykah Badu\u2014aka \u201cSara Bellum,\u201d aka \u201cFat Belly Bella,\u201d aka \u201cMedulla Oblongata,\u201d aka \u201cLow Down Loretta Brown,\u201d aka \u201cAnalogue Girl in a Digital World\u201d\u2014who pushed all the way through in what she called \u201catomic micro cosmic Badu braids.\u201d\n\nAnd just when we thought this summer\u2019s cornrow craze had calmed down, Nicki Minaj came through and put it on us with \u201cPink Lemonade,\u201d a fully remixed version of Queen Bey\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d braids. As per usual, black hair is out here being great.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always the case. Like any initiative, it takes time and momentum to gain traction. When enough people get on board, it becomes a runaway train\u2014a movement.\n\nNatural hair isn\u2019t new; it was promoted during the Black Power and Black Arts movements of the late \u201960s and \u201970s, when African Americans were encouraged to celebrate black aesthetics and pride. These ideas were realized through hairstyles like the Afro, braids and dreadlocks. However, as the movements fizzled, the exaltation of naturally textured hair did, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA resurgence\u2014that I refer to as \u201cthe first wave\u201d\u2014occurred in the 1990s as black representation became more visible in mainstream culture. Simultaneously, black women began to embrace natural hairstyles\u2014braids and twists in particular. Ethnic hairdos like box braids, cornrows and twists, once reserved for leisure and younger women, moved into professional spaces and even into entertainment.\n\nThursday nights were spent watching Living Single and fawning over Erika Alexander\u2019s fabulous bobbed nu-locs. And let\u2019s not forget Brandy Norwood\u2019s role as Moesha, the sassy braided teen. Their attention-grabbing hairdos boosted braiding salon services and marked a new era in black aesthetics called the natural-hair movement.\n\nCelebrity stylist Debra Hare-Bey of Debra Hare-bey Private Parlor @ OMHH (Oh My Heavenly Hair) Beauty Oasis in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., says that much like in the \u201960s and \u201970s, the catalyst for the natural-hair boom in the \u201990s was due to \u201ca feeling of pride from the inside that began to reflect on the outside.\u201d\n\nMoving into the new millennium, a shift occurred. Concepts of natural hair were not solely about being in vogue, but also about a lifestyle. As black women adopted more holistic approaches to living healthy, hair also became a consideration. Women resorted to the big chop, shirking chemical relaxers for their own healthy textured manes, and changed the landscape of black hair. The twist-out and \u2019fros were reborn, locs were more plentiful and protective hairstyles grew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccordingly, traditional hair-product lines were forced to recognize and respond to a rapidly growing market and new demographic that was previously ignored: \u201cBlack women immobilized an entire beauty industry to pay attention to their hair needs. Hair-care products, books and videos are now available in the general market. Target, Walmart [and] Sally\u2019s all carry merchandise and product for natural hair. It makes me proud,\u201d says Diane C. Bailey, expert stylist and author of Milady Standard Natural Hair Care & Braiding.\n\nForward-thinking entrepreneurs and stylists began accommodating these new naturalistas in committing to their kinky tresses by expanding natural-hair services and designing hair-care products that catered to the complexities of black hair. Innovators in that market were Jane Carter Solutions, Miss Jessie\u2019s and, more recently, SheaMoisture.\n\nAs more women embraced the coils they were born with, the movement evolved yet again. This go-round, women took education and style into their own hands by learning texture and techniques and exploring creativity. Trial and error and black women\u2019s agency and ingenuity resulted in the creation of a show-and-tell culture on YouTube and other social media. Many women transitioned from bathroom stylists into natural-hair gurus by sharing product reviews, how-tos and DIY tutorials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese women created economic lanes for themselves while educating and empowering others who were at the start of their natural-hair journeys. These women are the new voice of the movement and the progenitors of new techniques and style. For example, Susy Oludele, professionally known as \u201cAfrican Creature,\u201d is the masterful hair artist behind Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d braids. She developed her YouTube and instagram presence around her styling prowess, and has parlayed her colorful hair artistry into a successful business.\n\nAs natural hair evolves, we continue to see self-expression that pushes the envelope: bold hues, enchanting adornment, even shaved heads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a once quiet movement, women have discovered and liberated their true selves. Through hair\u2014or a lack thereof\u2014we black women are asserting our identity. Bald beauty and clothing designer Sarah Nicole Fran\u00e7ois feels that much of what people decide about black women is attached to hair. She says that being bald, though it comes with its own presumptions, freed her from a lot of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, y\u2019all wanna use my hair to decide what kind of black person you think I am? Well now, I don\u2019t have any. So what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack hair has a history of being politicized. However, the natural-hair movement has snatched those roots and redefined the black aesthetic for black women and popular culture. Natural hair has given women agency and voice when it comes to our identity and freedom of expression. It is no longer a movement, it is mainstay.

Shortly afterward, Bannon stepped down from his position as chief white hood at the white nationalist rag Breitbart.\n\nWho knows if Bannon is ready to go full First 48 and reveal everything he knows, but look to him to directly or indirectly take every opportunity to bash Kushner, because the two have never gotten along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis could be glorious.\n\nRead more at the New York Times and HuffPost.", "keywords": ["white", "york", "times", "strategist", "snitch", "subpoenaed", "investigation", "bannon", "trumps", "chief", "house", "steve", "russian", "grand", "subpoena"], "polarity": 0.11437316891862348, "subjectivity": 0.36999650181468374},

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["white", "allies", "men", "going", "airport", "need", "know", "im", "dont", "world", "work", "flight", "speak", "enemies"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people. And not giving enough of a shit to notice.", "keywords": ["white", "things", "better", "floor", "werent", "person", "youd", "day", "guest", "type", "black", "didnt", "learn", "way"], "polarity": 0.016623178951946087, "subjectivity": 0.4481680800173951},

The R&B landscape at the time, full of pixie cuts and power ballads, emphasized polish, with divas like Whitney and Mariah, and R&B princesses like Brandy and Monica. In floats the ethereal Miss Erykah Badu, n\u00e9e Erykah Abi Wright, with her debut album. She chose the stage name \u201cBadu\u201d as a nod to her favorite jazz-scat sound.\n\nNothing in the late-\u201990s R&B scene indicated that we were ready for a woman who could scat Five Percenter mathematics and sing about mother ships. But how could we? \u201cNeo-soul\u201d as a term didn\u2019t exist before music executive Kedar Massenburg coined it in 1997. The singer herself has never adopted it, preferring her musical proclivities unlabeled.\n\n\n\nBut just a few weeks shy of her 26th birthday, Badu was ready for us. She took the stage with no available comparison, hair wrapped in a precariously tall tower of fabric, inviting us to pick from her \u201cAppletree.\u201d And she offered no apologies for being who she was. Her jazz-inflected vocal stylings drew musical comparisons to Lady Day. She never claimed to carry that mantle, either.\n\n\n\nBadu\u2019s sensibility was unmistakably hip-hop, but laced with a molasses drawl that let you know where in the country she was coming from. At 5 feet tall, this hummingbird from the South had something to say. Small wonder that she found a muse in her beau at the time, Atlanta rapper Andre 3000 (he played her love interest in the videos for \u201cOtherside of the Game\u201d and \u201cNext Lifetime\u201d). Although Badu\u2019s sound has evolved throughout her tenure, her music remains deeply rooted in Southern funk and culture. She is just as likely to ad-lib \u201cOooh, child\u201d as she is to airily sing about positive energy.\n\n\n\nIn terms of songwriting, the album proudly resists drive-thru interpretation. All these years later, I\u2019m still not sure I completely understand what \u201cOn & On\u201d is about, even though I love it. But part of the song\u2019s charm is that when she stops singing and asks, \u201cDamn, y\u2019all feel that?\u201d We do. We did.\n\n\n\nBaduizm offers a bit of everything: mother wit and wisdom, black-girl-next-door romance, mysticism, frustration over a trifling man. Badu\u2019s songwriting struck gold for me with her uncanny ability to combine the spiritual with the mundane. In \u201cNext Lifetime,\u201d she flits between longing for another man and hoping for their reincarnation as butterflies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe debut established Badu as equal parts playful and serious about life, traits that have remained part of the singer\u2019s mystique over the past two decades. The album dealt with more than the ups and downs of love. It hinted at social issues and black response to them, a characteristic known as being \u201cconscious,\u201d that would help position neo-soul as political soundtrack. In \u201cDrama\u201d she questions, \u201cWith all the problems of the day/How can we go on?\u201d At times her honeyed vibrato evokes peace; in other places, a revolution.\n\nCould Baduizm go certified triple platinum in 2017, in the social media era of the #CarefreeBlackGirl and #HotepTwitter? The Erykah Badu we first met back in 1997, in some ways, might have struggled to stand out in the current mainstream of performative Afrocentrism. Black Twitter might have called her \u201chotep\u201d and \u201ccanceled\u201d her before the end of the album played. However, it\u2019s impossible to say\u2014Badu is really the progenitor of the modern Afrofuturist soul singer. Artists like Solange and Janelle Mon\u00e1e thrive in their lane in part because a green-eyed black girl from Dallas set the standard.\n\n\n\nBaduizm would go on to net the soul singer two of her eventual four Grammy Awards. Her debut was critically acclaimed, even though her sophomore album (Mama\u2019s Gun, 2000) remains many fans\u2019 popular favorite. Perhaps that distinction is due to the latter album\u2019s cohesive backing by hip-hop and neo-soul collective the Soulquarians. Still, Baduizm strongly anchors the holy trinity of neo-soul albums: Brown Sugar by D\u2019Angelo (1995), Urban Hang Suite by Maxwell (1996) and Baduizm (1997).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSonically, those landmark albums set the tone for a cool decade\u2019s worth of departures from the smoothly produced R&B that ruled the airwaves. Neo-soul helped shift popular black music from synthesized slow jams to live bands in coffee shops. The more \u201corganic\u201d the instrumentation, the better. The genre gave us a perpetual Love Jones soundtrack. Where R&B would veer sometimes laughably close to rap in the aughts, neo-soul stubbornly declared for spoken-word poetry.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the three pioneers recently broke yearslong hiatuses to again produce stair-step releases, with D\u2019Angelo and the Vanguard\u2019s Black Messiah (2014), Badu\u2019s mixtape But You Caint Use My Phone (2015) and Maxwell\u2019s long-awaited blackSUMMERS\u2019night (2016).\n\n\n\nIn the pantheon of neo-soul artists, Baduizm firmly established Badu\u2019s reign as first lady. And after 20 years in the game, what is Badu\u2019s legacy? She continues to be both hip-hop and Southern, contributing to and borrowing from each of these traditions. She has turned her eclecticism into her brand\u2014but she\u2019s still cool enough to remake a Drake tune. Her last project, a mixtape, came in 2015 and drew sales rivaling a proper album.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the first female neo-soul artist, Badu influenced her peers and the next generation of soul artists with her music and aesthetic. When you consider the caliber of singers who followed Badu\u2019s breakout effort, the list is impressive: Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill in 1998, Jill Scott in 2000, India.Arie in 2001.\n\n\n\nNo one quite saw Badu coming in 1997. But all these years later, looking at her impressive body of work, I can\u2019t imagine what black music would be like without her. Happy 20th birthday, Baduizm.\n\n", "keywords": ["album", "rb", "turns", "badu", "love", "great", "baduizm", "20", "music", "badus", "black", "neosoul", "singer"], "polarity": 0.10527805527805528, "subjectivity": 0.4073371073371073},

Fair enough, because not everyone wants food that sometimes comes with body hair\u2014enough to make you put back the BBQ sauce and grab a razor. And given her long-standing command of all things visual and eclectic, a pro-kimono dress code wasn\u2019t all that surprising, either.\n\nAlso not shocking: It all made perfect sense once you entered her space and broke vegan bread with her.\n\nThe event, held last Monday at the private dining space the Kitchen Table, was sponsored by BET and Centric to help promote this year\u2019s Soul Train Awards, airing Sunday on both networks. As Badu explained to the dinner attendees, this marks the third time she has hosted the iconic awards show. For those who don\u2019t recall the first (I didn\u2019t until she reminded me), it was when Badu co-hosted with the late Heavy D.\n\nIn a desire to not sound like a complete country trope, I\u2019m well-aware that vegan food can be appetizing. Now, I don\u2019t know why tasty pasta with secret orange sauce has to be called vegan macaroni and cheese, but blasphemous naming aside, the dish can be a delight. I\u2019ve had other satisfying experiences, but have also embarked on some that are the culinary equivalent of an oil spill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was not the case here, though, thanks to the talents of Oakland, Calif.-based vegan chef Bryant Terry, who handled the seven-course meal, and New York City culinary crew Ghetto Gastro, who handled the hors d\u2019oeuvres. Their efforts made a few things clear: Vegan chili can have a kick; you can, surprisingly, make something coconut-based taste like Blue Bell ice cream; and BBQ tempeh tastes great even if you had no clue what tempeh was beforehand.\n\nGood food and wine aside, what felt most rewarding was the host herself, whose presence was felt even before she formally made an appearance. Badu set the tone as you walked in with the scent of incense and purple lighting. It will be just as evident tomorrow night. As Badu recently revealed to USA Today: \u201cI did a lot of things, including writing the monologues and writing the intros for some of the presenters, choosing the artists who would perform and helping to create the segments.\u201d\n\nOnce Badu did make her way out to greet guests and lead dinner, you were reminded of what makes her such an ideal host for the legendary award show. She was earnest with her engagement of the sea of black faces before her, she was naturally funny and she was incredibly genuine when reflecting on her love of the show. One of the other best things about Badu is that while she may shift your mind to the nostalgia of her debut nearly 20 years ago, as her 2015 mixtape But You Cain\u2019t Use My Phone reminds us, she\u2019s ever so current.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the Soul Train Awards will be hopping back and forth between revisiting the past and letting our present stars shine. Both Brandy and Teddy Riley will be honored for their legendary careers. Other \u201990s acts, like Ma$e, Carl Thomas and Wreckx-n-Effect, will also be performing. As for contemporary acts, Yuna, BJ the Chicago Kid and Badu collaborator D.R.A.M. will be gracing the stage.\n\nOf course Badu will be guiding the show throughout the night. One other thought that came to mind the night of Badu\u2019s soul vegan dinner was the importance of catharsis. For many, tomorrow will be a few hours of escapism.\n\nThe show was taped days before the election, so there will be no response to the election of Donald Trump Minute Maid Mao.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get too deep into politics,\u201d Badu explained. \u201cIt was strictly about music and letting it bring out whatever emotions each individual wanted to have. It\u2019s about music doing what it does best, because music is our politics. Music is our escape.\u201d\n\nIf Sunday night\u2019s show is anything like the dinner she hosted, it will be a fun, soul-fulfilling, much-needed distraction.\n\nThe Soul Train Awards air Sunday, Nov. 27, at 8 p.m. EST on BET and Centric.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Not because I think it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase, but because I have no idea what it means. I\u2019ve never had anyone come up to me and ask me to apologize for my race or my name. Also, it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m probably \u201capologetically black,\u201d because, in my most honest moments, unfettered by the societal implications of class, race and social status, I must admit ... I kinda feel sorry for white people. Not all white people, but I imagine it must be hard going through life not recognizing downbeats and thinking paprika is spicy.\n\nYes, I am apologetically black.\n\nBut apparently some people in St. Joseph\u2019s, Minn., have been repeatedly forced to apologize for their whiteness because USA Today reports that posters saying \u201cUnapologetically White,\u201d \u201cEnd White Guilt\u201d and \u201cWe Have a Right to Exist\u201d popped up around town on Wednesday. The posters are all branded by the St. Cloud State White Student Union, although the college says it is not a registered organization on campus.\n\nHowever, the organization has a Facebook page named St. Cloud White Student Union and describes itself as such:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not even mad at the St. Cloud State White Student Union; I\u2019m just confused. Apparently, I have been spending my time in the wrong places because I\u2019m never around when people gang up to oppress the populace of ecru-colored martyrs.\n\nI was involved in the Black Student Union while I was in college, but I\u2019d love to attend a White Student Union event. Do they play pinochle like we play spades? Do they discuss how hard it is being white in Minnesota surrounded by so many other alabasterians? Are their field trips to kale farms and HWCUs? Do they throw an off-step show every year for the fraternities and sororities?\n\nOnce, at a Denny\u2019s around 3 a.m. in Goose Creek, S.C., while watching a 52-year-old white dude mop up a drunken white sorority girl\u2019s grits-vomit, I wondered what kind of crazy Caucasian hijinks he was involved in that led to waiting tables during the graveyard shift at a pancake restaurant, when he has every societal advantage and privilege. I mean, he was white! The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it. I can\u2019t imagine having control of the media; every part of the local, state and national government; the education system, the banking system, the economy; and politics and the entire damn country and still feeling sorry for myself like a 6-year-old who can\u2019t get an ice cream cone because he\u2019s already eaten too many cookies.

In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it.

The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn.

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated.

I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment. Their bail has been set at $9 million apiece, according to CNN.

It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["releases", "michael", "times", "pence", "james", "statement", "sing", "guilty", "flynn", "lying", "trump", "subtweet", "russian", "pleading", "charges", "pleaded", "responds"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

While many are outraged by his protest, others are joining him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSafety Eric Reid knelt with Kaepernick during the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 final preseason game, while in Oakland, Calif., Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane sat while the song played over the speakers. It\u2019s not just a football thing. In solidarity with Kaepernick, soccer star Megan Rapinoe knelt while the anthem played before the Seattle Reign played the Chicago Red Stars in a National Women's Soccer League game. The fans are also responding. Kaepernick\u2019s jersey has skyrocketed in popularity seemingly overnight.\n\nThe decision to kneel during the anthem is brilliant strategically. Robert J. Barsocchini, writing at Counterpunch, points out:\n\n\n\nThe 35 year-old who wrote the US national anthem, Francis Scott Key, appears to have been a remorseless enslaver and abuser of black people, a tireless pro-slavery activist, a religious fundamentalist, and a proponent of genocide and land theft. \u2026 It seems that asking a black or Native person to respect or honor this song would be like asking a Jewish person to honor a song written by a Nazi. Even if the most blatantly offensive lyrics were removed, it is hard to imagine that anyone in the US, except maybe a neo-Nazi, would feel any anger towards a Jewish person who refused to honor a song written by, say, Joseph Goebbels. That the dominant US culture chooses to use as its very national anthem a song written by a genocidal slave-driver, and becomes enraged when a black person chooses not to honor it, illustrates, [Gerald] Horne[, professor of African-American studies at the University of Houston] said, that the US was \u201cfounded on slavery and genocide\u201d, but also, crucially, \u201cin denial.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's time that we come to terms with the vicious legacy of who wrote this song and what it represents. Yet, since critics of Kaepernick took offense at both his method of protest and what they complained were his \u201cvague\u201d demands, I have decided to be solutions-oriented. Put simply, we need a new national anthem, and I have a few ideas about who should write it.\n\n\n\n1. Desiigner\n\nHe is the pre-eminent purveyor of melodic mumblecore hip-hop that is less about the specifics of the lyrics and more about the feeling of a song\u2014the way we treat the current national anthem. For example, we either didn\u2019t know the details of the third verse or were normalized to the fact that we were standing in honor of a song that glorifies slavery. Desiigner would make a song that is hummable but to which no one would know the words.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Jazmine Sullivan\n\nThe polyvalent nature of her songwriting is incredible. On the surface, the song would appear to be a celebration of America, but just beneath the obvious meaning would be a critique of patriarchy and anti-blackness. Plus, I love her voice. She would sing the whiteness off that song.\n\n\n\n3. Kanye West\n\nTruth be told, Ye can be an insightful rapper about race. From \"All Falls Down\" to \"New Slaves,\" the Louis Vuitton Don has made thought-provoking music about the intersection of race and class\u2014just don\u2019t let him introduce the song.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Rihanna\n\nThis one is for the conservatives who think immigration is part of what is keeping America from being great. Despite what Trump says, the contributions of those who were not born in America have been invaluable to the development of this country. Also, as the name of her most recent album implies, she\u2019s just so Anti. As my friend Emily Lordi, associate professor of English at UMass Amherst and author of the forthcoming book Donny Hathaway Live, recently pointed out in conversation, \u201cHer version would be the least anthemic anthem ever\u2014perfect for our times.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. 2 Chainz\n\nDos cadenas makes trap music that is just ignant (yes, I spelled it how I wanted). His song would be so unapologetic in its embrace of capitalism and excess that only an American could have written it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Brittany Howard\n\nA 27-year-old vocalist from Athens, Ala., Howard is the lead singer and guitarist of the Alabama Shakes. \u201cI think she's one of the most fascinating songwriters currently working,\u201d said Charles Hughes, director of the Memphis Center at Rhodes College and author of Country Soul: Making Music and Making Race in the American South. \u201cHer political material has been muted, at least so far, but it's been conceptually interesting. [From Howard] one can expect an anthem characterized by three words: obscurity, blurring, noise.\u201d\n\n\n\n7. D\u2019Angelo\n\nThe sonics of the song would be layered to an inch of its life, and it would not be finished on time, but few people can make music like this singer from Richmond, Va. I imagine there would be an almost insufferable amount of bass guitar and screaming on the track, but if \u201c1000 Deaths\u201d is any indication of what he would do with the song, I\u2019m here for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Erykah Badu\n\nMs. Badu is an obvious choice. She is engaged politically, and her music has included both African and black American traditions for years. Even her misguided support of R. Kelly is distinctly American\u2014folks in this country have engaged in revisionist history and turned a blind eye to evil since its inception.\n\n\n\n9. Chance the Rapper\n\nHe has been around for a while, but this is his breakout year. Chance would bring his infectious optimism to the song and find a way to blend virtually all black American musical inspirations in the song. It would be a gospel, R&B, jazz, blues trap song\u2014meaning that it would be brilliant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Beyonc\u00e9\n\nWhite folks recently discovered that she is black and they still cannot help bowing at the altar of Bey. She would make a song that was so infectious despite being unapologetically black that even Donald Trump supporters would be forced to like it.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. For example, I could have included the Diplomats, since they already have \u201cDipset Anthem,\u201d and only small changes to that song would be needed to capture the colonial gangsterism of America\u2014as especially directed toward Native Americans and represented by endless breaking of treaties and the contemporaneous Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need a new anthem\u2014preferably one that does not celebrate slavery, colonialism or any other form of oppression rooted in white supremacy. Feel free to use this list as a starting point.\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

That is a clear indication that Flynn might be negotiating a plea deal that could include him testifying against the president or senior White House officials, according to the report.\n\nThose negotiations would include prosecutors telling Flynn, off the record, of course, the evidence they have against him. They would then give him the opportunity to disclose what information or evidence he has that could implicate others in the case, up to and including the president himself.\n\nSources told ABC News that prior to last week\u2019s break, Flynn\u2019s legal counsel and Trump\u2019s legal team had engaged in privileged discussions for months.\n\nOne member of the Trump legal team, Jay Sekulow, told ABC News last week that the break was \u201cnot entirely unexpected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about Gen. Flynn cooperating against the president,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nBut other sources have told ABC News that the general has been feeling the heat ever since prosecutors began focusing on his son, Michael G. Flynn, who worked as a part of Flynn Intel Group. The younger Flynn accompanied his father in 2015 on the trip to Russia where the elder Flynn appeared at a Moscow dinner sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition, ABC News reports that Democrats in Congress forwarded information to the Mueller team allegedly showing that during his confirmation process, Flynn illegally concealed more than a dozen foreign contacts and overseas trips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a letter to Flynn\u2019s attorney, Democratic Reps.

At least not special or distinguishable enough to bother distinguishing it.\n\nAnd if this is true, Donald Trump is telling the truth.

And then also a compulsion to watch the last 10 minutes of Django Unchained.\n\nSometimes, when digesting, processing and assessing the absurdity of the day-to-day minutiae of existing as an American during the Trump presidency, it can be easy to forget just how fucking insane it is that Trump is president in the first place. That the dude with the weird hair and oft-imitated voice from The Apprentice and the dozens of girlfriends and wives and the gold-plated toilets, and whose name is a common synonym for a certain type of shamelessness and performative gauche, is president of the United States of America. And was voted to be president by tens of millions of people despite having absolutely no experience, no competence, no agenda and no platform other than \u201cI\u2019m famous and, um, racist.\u201d We made the guy who was the inspiration for the main antagonist in Gremlins 2 the leader of the free world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, a recurring theme in the pushback against Trump is a hope that the next election provides a return to normalcy. In this context, \u201cnormalcy\u201d would be an actual politician in the White House instead of our Stable Dotard. The thinking being that we (the American people) will have tired of this celebrity-as-a-world-leader sociological experiment. Basically, Trump broke America, and we need a grown-up to fix it.\n\nBut I\u2019m not so sure this is going to happen. If there\u2019s anything his election has proved\u2014well, anything other than white people\u2019s willingness to self-destruct if said self-destruction helps to preserve whiteness\u2014it\u2019s that our (collective) affinity for celebrity is the tie that binds us. Trump didn\u2019t break America. He broke the celebrity-for-president dam.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve elected famous people with no history in politics to elected office before. But as president? Putting someone with no political experience into the highest office in the land seemed too far-fetched even for us. Even Ronald Reagan was a governor first. But after witnessing Trump\u2019s \u201csuccess,\u201d what would stop Mark Zuckerberg or Mark Cuban or Jeff Bezos or Beyonc\u00e9 or any other insanely rich and popular and powerful person from throwing his or her hat in the ring?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, most important, what would stop us from voting for them? You know why there\u2019s so much conversation now about Oprah potentially running for president? Because we know now that she could win.\n\nThis, by the way, isn\u2019t intended to be any sort of commentary on whether I think Oprah could (or should) run. She should do whatever the hell she wants to do. She\u2019s earned that right. All I\u2019m saying is that an Oprah Winfrey-Gayle King(?) ticket ain\u2019t nothin\u2019. Wait until we get the Rock-Taylor Swift. Or Beyonc\u00e9-LeBron James. Or Neil deGrasse Tyson-Mike Tyson. Or Bill Belichick-Elon Musk. Or Joe Biden-Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe celebrity avalanche has begun, and the only thing stopping it will be ... whatever the hell it is that stops avalanches.

Of course, seeing Wakanda brought up a lot of questions: What\u2019s the deal with those sand-like 3D display systems they have? How do they make such good holographic images come out of stylish bracelets? How fast do those mag-lev trains go? And, perhaps most importantly, what are Wakandan cars like?\n\n\n\nOh, I guess I should mention there will likely be some kind of spoilers here, so, you know, I\u2019m warning you now. Here be spoilers. Run.\n\nNow, while we saw a number of very impressive Wakandan transportation machines: aircraft (possibly spacecraft as well?), mag-lev trains, what looked like a nice light-rail system, we never actually saw any Wakandan rolling, car-like automobiles. Perhaps their cities are designed to not require them, or perhaps they prefer mass-transit and air travel culturally; I\u2019m not really sure. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing some speculation about what a Wakandan car could be.\n\nI\u2019m actually thinking of a very specific kind of Wakandan car: a Wakandan export-market car. I\u2019m taking as a jumping-off point the events at the end of the movie, where Wakanda is finally abandoning their centuries-long self-imposed isolation from the world and will now become part of the global community, an act which will include the desemination of advanced Wakandan technology to the world, at least to some degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandan technology is based on the (again, sadly) fictional element known as Vibranium, of which Wakanda has an incredibly supply of, thanks to a massive meteorite of the stuff buried beneath the country. We see vibranium powering things like Black Panther\u2019s suit, for example, and it\u2019s clearly capable of some incredible things, which is why it\u2019s so incredibly valuable.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Wakandans will try to immediately upgrade the entire planet to the level of technology they enjoy; that would be a colossal undertaking, and not only am I not sure that makes sense for Wakanda, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even possible. What I do think will happen is that Wakanda will produce products for global consumption that, while largely similar to existing global technology, and as such are understandable and will work with current global infrastructure, will incorporate some amount of advanced Wakandan vibranum-based tech to make them better in some dramatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the Wakandan car will be like: it\u2019ll be essentially recognizable as a car, in that it will have wheels that can use tires you can buy from any local tire store and you\u2019ll drive it and use it in essentially the same way we use cars now, but it will have a huge vibranium-related advantage. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m imagining this first Wakandan export market car, the Wakanda Motors Ingwe (that\u2019s Xhosa for \u2018panther\u2019 or \u2018puma\u2019) , will be:\n\nIt\u2019ll be a hybrid, fundamentally. But with a very crucial difference. Where the hybrids the rest of the world builds rely on heavy, inefficient chemical storage batteries, the Wakandan car will use the remarkable energy-absorbing and releasing power of vibranium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this power in action in Black Panther\u2019s suit, which has vibranium fibers woven into it. Black Panther gets shot with a bullet, for example, but instead of peeing himself and dying like most of us would, the suit not only stops the bullet, but absorbs the considerable kinetic energy from the bullet, stores it, and later releases it when Black Panther wants to do something like punch a truck through a building.\n\nThe WM Ingwe would use this kinetic energy-storage and release property of vibranium to replace the heavy batteries of a hybrid. By building the cars with an alloy of aluminum and vibranium for the main parts of the frame, and perhaps some of the main body panels, the Wakandan car would have a structure that\u2019s not just light and incredibly strong, but capable of storing vast amounts of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause vibranium has so far only been shown as something that can store and release energy, not generate it, we\u2019d still need to provide some initial source energy into the system. It may be possible to set up some sort of \u2018charging stations\u2019 which input energy into the vibranium frame of the car, allowing for a purely electric vehicle, but I was thinking it might be more useful for these cars to use a small internal combustion engine to act as an initial source of energy; It could be a fairly small motor, one liter or less, maybe something equivalent to one of the small three-cylinder motors being built by Ford, GM, Mitsubishi, BMW, whoever.\n\nMaybe this part will be sourced outside of Wakanda, or maybe some Wakandan researchers will have fun developing a tiny, powerful ICE engine of their own. It doesn\u2019t really matter. My guess is it would be a better PR move if they partnered with local companies to produce this part of the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, probably the best move to keep from overly disrupting the global economy would be for them to just license the fundamental technology and provide the needed vibranium to companies all over the world. In that sense, think of the WM Ingwe as a sort of low-volume reference vehicle, with versions of the basic tech produced by established carmakers, under license.)\n\nThe ICE motor would get things started, turning gasoline or diesel into kinetic energy that would start \u2018charging\u2019 the vibranium frame, which would then provide power output to the main electric motor driving the rear axles. Let\u2019s say this is a Wakandan-designed motor, a scaled-down version of what they\u2019re already making for their trains or mining equipment or hover-ship windshield wipers. Based on their technological prowess with this stuff, I imagine this could be a pretty potent motor, certainly comparable to what Teslas use. Let\u2019s say it can produce a peak horsepower of 500, because why not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce in motion, the vibranium frame and body panels are collecting every bit of kinetic energy they encounter\u2014the molecules of air that hit the body of the car will transfer their kinetic energy to the system, the vibrations of the road, the motions of the passengers inside, along with more traditional energy reclamation systems like regenerative braking.\n\nHell, if the car was sitting for a while, and you forgot to put fuel in the ICE motor, you could probably get a good 10 or 20 miles of range by just pounding on the hood with your fists for a few minutes.\n\nVibranium has been shown to be incredibly effective at harvesting ambient kinetic energy; a few minutes of ICE-assisted driving would likely be enough to charge the vibranium up to the point where you could travel for 200 to 300 miles before needing to restart the gas engine\u2014perhaps more if it was windy, or if you, say, got caught in a rainstorm, with each raindrop adding a nice burst of energy to the car as it impacted the vibranium-alloy roof and hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you\u2019d have, essentially, is a hybrid car without the biggest disadvantage of a hybrid: the heavy, inefficient battery. The vibranium frame and body panels would be both an incredibly strong and safe structure for the car as well as all the energy storage the car needs. You could shave hundreds and hundreds of pounds from cars, eliminate the difficult and environmentally troubling mining of resources like lithium, and never worry about finding a charging station or if your battery pack is going to degrade to uselessness after 10 years.\n\nWith a car like this, the Wakandans could make every Prius (and likely Tesla) on the road obsolete overnight. Wakandan vibranium technology has the potential to make incredibly efficient automobiles without sacrificing range or performance. I can\u2019t wait until we start seeing these things on the market\u2014you\u2019d have to be an idiot to buy anything that didn\u2019t use Wakandan vibranium-based tech.\n\nOh, shit, right.

Sure, she did an admiral cover of \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me?\u201d But this isn\u2019t the same Alicia Keys of 2001. Maybe she\u2019s been on vocal rest for the past four years. Yet, I still don\u2019t trust her falsetto. Give her something simple to sing like, \u201cSometimes It Snows In April.\u201d Place her ass behind the keyboard and tell her to keep still physically and vocally. There are only a few with the vocal dexterity of Prince, and Alicia isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal are mandatory\n\nSpeaking of vocal dexterity you absolutely have to include at least one of these singers.

But it\u2019s her entire movement that resonates and reflects the legacy of Prince. The many talented people Prince put on spans from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to Tevin Campbell. Hell, even Janet Jackson owes Prince credit for the Minneapolis sound on Control and Rhythm Nation. Janelle Monae falls into the same category with her Wonderland crew, particularly Roman GianArthur. I had the pleasure of seeing him live twice. He embodies Prince in both style and musicianship, which is a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInclude the OGs\n\nI\u2019ve listed all of the new schoolers, but we have to mention the old school. It is mandatory that you include Morris Day & The Time, Shelia E. and Wendy and Lisa. These artists worked with him during his prime and literally played an instrumental role in developing the Prince sound of the 80s. It\u2019s blasphemous and disrespectful not to mention their contributions to the Minneapolis sound. Besides, I really want to see Jerome get Morris\u2019 mirror one good time before he lives this earth. Stay strong Jerome\u2026stay strong!\n\nWho should sing Purple Rain?\n\nThis one is complicated. It\u2019s a classic. It really shouldn\u2019t be touched. Yet, it really isn\u2019t a Prince tribute without \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d I mean, no one can really do this song any justice. Not even Patti LaYelle. No disrespect. (Shout out to PattiLaHelle for the reference.) Sure Fanatasia and Jennifer Hudson have the vocal fortitude to carry it. But will they overdo it? And what about the guitar solo? This is why I say choose either one of these singers. Let Lenny Kravitz start it. Add Fantasia or J Hud (not both) to sing the second part. Finally, let Lenny rip the guitar to shreds. It\u2019s the only way our ears can survive a non-karaoke/karaoke version of \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this sounds more like a concert instead of a 20 to 30-minute tribute.

And what a show of fecal spray it was today.\n\n\n\nOn a day when Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, surrendered to authorities after a federal grand jury indicted the pair on 12 counts, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders put on one of her most dazzling displays of truth bending to date.\n\nSanders executed her usual routine of evading questions by saying that she hadn\u2019t \u201cspoken to the president about it\u201d (then bish, why are you here?) and dragging Hillary Clinton\u2019s name into business that has nothing to do with her.

To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part.

I mean that she\u2019s a real natural fit for the job.\u201d Which then reminded me that white dudes always find a way to abbreviate words for no fucking reason.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while man, how was the vacay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed to Shake Shack to grab some burgs, dude. You wanna roll?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a little soiree at my apt this weekend. Feel free to come through with your LL (see: little lady).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis shit needs to stop. I\u2019m fluent as shit in slang, but I\u2019m fuck-all in abbreviations.\n\nSuggest places to purchase electronics.\n\nDid you know that white men go to stores where they don\u2019t know anybody that works there and pay full price for electronic items that come in sealed boxes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nI told one of my white compadres that I was looking for a new TV so he recommended a spot. When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["white", "men", "wrong", "things", "know", "im", "maybe", "guys", "black", "probably", "letting", "stop", "saying", "charge"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.\n\n\n\nWhile her speech touched on historical racism and sexism, which are woven into the fabric of Hollywood\u2019s ethos, her speech transcended the moment, much like in 2004 when a little-known Illinois state senator stole the show at the Democratic National Convention. In fact, it was Oprah at peak Oprah; she was considerate, measured and gracious, and promised that America was headed toward a new day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe did all of this in a stunning, all-black gown (a show of solidarity with the #MeToo movement against sexual assault), and dare I say it, she looked and sounded real presidential. If the Golden Globes were giving out awards for best transcendent, presidential-esque speech, Oprah would have won. Hands down.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one who thought this; rumors began sprouting up all over social media. People were tweeting \u201cOprah 2020!\u201d everywhere. Internet sleuths were digging through Oprah\u2019s internet garbage to see if there were any signs that she was, in fact, gearing up to put a ring on America\u2019s naked finger (we don\u2019t fuck with the man in office), to make it official.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the message still isn\u2019t clear as to whether or not one of America\u2019s richest woman will consider a run for office. Shortly after her Golden Globe speech, Oprah told Bloomberg backstage that she didn\u2019t plan to run, but Stedman Graham (Oprah\u2019s longtime partner) told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s up to the people. She would absolutely do it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, CNN, citing two unnamed friends, reported that Winfrey is \u201cactively thinking\u201d about a presidential run, but unless both of those friends\u2019 names rhyme with \u201cBayle Bing,\u201d I don\u2019t believe said \u201cfriends\u201d of Oprah.\n\nI can\u2019t lie; I, too, floated the idea of Oprah as president, and hoped that it would mean, \u201cYou get a tax break, and you get a tax break!\u201d A longer look, however, forces me to one concrete thought: Oprah is not America\u2019s mammy, so please don\u2019t ask her to come clean up this white man\u2019s mess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one year the president has put his muddy-ass boots all over President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. He\u2019s torn the heart out of Obamacare, without a sensible, effective, health care replacement; he\u2019s given \u201creparations\u201d to the top 1 percent in this lame \u201ctax reform\u201d bill; and he\u2019s emboldened white supremacy, all while getting the entire United States involved in a nuclear Twitter beef with the supreme leader of North Korea. Not to mention, his nasty ass eats KFC in the White House and doesn\u2019t even use coasters in the Oval Office.\n\nLook, I know that the idea of Oprah for president is a compelling and exciting idea. Could she be president? Of course she could! She\u2019s a black woman, and black women are all the faces on Mount Rushmore for fixing perpetually broken American shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut please don\u2019t hype this idea up. Oprah coming in after Obama would\u2019ve been ideal, and I think that she may have been considering it, but she was trying to give Hillary Clinton her shine, and I get that. But Oprah deserves more than inheriting a busted America with a broken economy, or the threat of a nuclear war, with an emboldened white supremacist army dressed in khakis and wielding tiki torches.\n\nShe or Gayle King (who would surely be her chief of staff) would have to have a sit-down with Kim Jong Un and Iyanla Vanzant to repair the damage this president has done. You know that she\u2019d have to get a corporate sponsor to donate tons of free swag to make shit right with the United Nations. I also know that Freestyle Taco Tuesday night at the White House would be lit, and so would the Easter Egg Roll, but it isn\u2019t worth losing one of America\u2019s treasures to try to undo the damage that this flagrantly white, white man has done.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer doesn\u2019t believe that Oprah has the political infrastructure for a successful presidential run. Not only is he wrong, but this is coming from a man who became so disheveled trying to cover for all of the current president\u2019s bullshit that he once left the White House wearing mismatched shoes. Besides, what political infrastructure did Trump have when he decided to run for office? Tweets about politics don\u2019t count, and currently there is an actual debate as to whether or not the current president of the United States is even literate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOprah could win, easily. Because Oprah could pull the 53 percent of secretly racist white woman who voted for Trump. When those white women claim that they have a black friend, they are talking about Oprah. Those are the women who betrayed their own interests and black America, and those women love them some Oprah.\n\nI know that the idea of an Oprah-and-Sen. Kamala Harris or Oprah-and-Rep. Maxine Waters ticket is fun, but think about the heavy lifting that Oprah would have to take on and ask yourself: In addition to trying to get us to eat better, love ourselves more and inspire us to live our best lives, should she really be responsible for balancing the budget, pulling us out of our national debt and playing nice with old white, racist senators?

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Ilessthan3photography/\" target=\"_blank\"> ilessthan3photography\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of. She\u2014and others like her\u2014deserve more options.\n\n", "keywords": ["nice", "wasnt", "characters", "options", "cosplay", "youre", "thats", "28daysofblackcosplay", "convention", "black", "nerd", "character"], "polarity": 0.11967108055343345, "subjectivity": 0.4806445760122231},

So to circumvent that, Mueller is using a secret weapon to prevent those pardons from happening.\n\nMueller has added Michael Dreeben to his team, according to Bloomberg. Dreeben is a career government lawyer who has the distinction of being one of only eight people in history to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court more than 100 times.\n\nSince Mueller brought him on, Dreeben has spent his time researching presidential pardons and figuring out what, if any, limits to them exist. He will also serve to make sure that everything Mueller does in a prosecutor capacity is legally airtight.\n\nIn reference to Dreeben, Kathryn Ruemmler of Latham & Watkins LLP\u2014 who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama\u2014told Bloomberg: \u201cHe\u2019s seen every criminal case of any consequence in the last 20 years. If you wanted to do a no-knock warrant, he\u2019d be a great guy to consult with to determine if you were exposing yourself.\u201d\n\nDreeben, 62, is the deputy solicitor general in charge of handling the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal docket before the Supreme Court. He has spent over three decades as an appeals lawyer for the Justice Department, and he has reviewed more than a thousand federal criminal prosecutions in that capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he has already begun working on legal issues for Mueller, he is also continuing to do some of his solicitor work for the sake of continuity, according to Bloomberg.\n\nA graduate of Duke University School of Law, he argued his first case in front of the Supreme Court in 1989. He lost to a private practice lawyer by the name of John Roberts, the same John Roberts who is now chief justice of the United States.\n\nJust what Dreeben will be able to help Mueller achieve remains to be seen, but the simple fact that Mueller is stacking his deck in his own favor shows that this Russia probe is far from over and is likely on the way to yielding some low-hanging fruit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Bloomberg.", "keywords": ["lawyer", "mueller", "supreme", "court", "secret", "criminal", "weapon", "bloomberg", "solicitor", "filed", "seen", "spent", "special", "pardon", "dreeben", "friends", "help", "trump", "try", "prevent"], "polarity": 0.10190476190476191, "subjectivity": 0.4786375661375661},

RIP the name Tyrone.\n\nAlso, on a more superficial level, she\u2019s become perhaps just as well-known for her status as this modern-day Doula Medusa hybrid.\n\nHuh? How so?\n\nShe\u2019s been romantically linked to a few high profile artists \u2014 most notably Andre 3000 and Common \u2014 and each of these men have undergone drastic changes after being with her. For instance, before Erykah, Dre was a jersey and fitted cap-rocking rapper from Atlanta. After Erykah, Dre starting dressing like the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou mean like the rapper Future?\n\nNo. The literal future. And not even someone from the future. Dre didn\u2019t dress like he was from 2316. He dressed like he was the year 2316.\n\nAnyway, this has given Badu a bit of a mystical aura. A woman whose eyes you dare not look into because her iris will twerk on your soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReally?\n\nYes. Really. I've never met Erykah Badu before, but I'm both in love with and scared to death of her.\n\nScared to death?\n\nTo quote Verbal Kent, \"Keaton always said 'I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.\" Well, I believe in God, but the only thing that scares me is Erykah Badu's eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. So, why is she in the news today?\n\nYou know that Kanye song \u201cReal Friends\u201d? Well, Erykah Badu is in the news today because she apparently doesn\u2019t have any right now. At least none willing and able to tell her to take 27 Window Seats and chill for a minute.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nLast week, as a response to a news story about a school in New Zealand with a dress code policy dictating that girls wear knee-length skirts so they won\u2019t distract boys, Badu tweeted her agreement, stating \u201cI agree. We are sexual beings. We should consider everyone. Young girls are attractive. Some males are distracted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, after receiving criticism for that tweet \u2014 which many people believed reinforced rape culture by implying that males (men and boys) have uncontrollable sexual urges that need to be quelled by conservatively dressed women \u2014 she tweeted:\n\n\n\nMales should be taught to be responsible for their actions from childhood. It's not ok to \"prey\" on young women. But do I think it is unnatural for a heterosexual male 2b attracted to a young woman in a revealing skirt? No. I think it is his nature.\n\nAnd then, after receiving criticism for that tweet \u2014 which many people believe reinforced rape culture by implying that a woman\u2019s or girl\u2019s choice of attire can determine whether she\u2019s sexually assaulted \u2014 she tweeted:\n\n\n\nIncorrect. An inclination to be attracted to women of child bearing age is natural. PEDOPHILIA is deviant behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, after receiving criticism for that tweet \u2014 which, since child-bearing age can be as early as nine or 10, implied it\u2019s natural for grown men to be sexually attracted to toddlers \u2014 she tweeted:\n\n\n\nAn older healthy non deviant male's attraction to flowering young women is as natural as a developing young girls attraction to older men.\n\nAnd then, after receiving criticism for that tweet \u2014 which doubled down on the toddler tweet by throwing in some \u201cgirls lust over grown men\u201d garnish, as if they\u2019re the same thing \u2014 she tweeted:\n\n\n\nBe careful w/feminism, veganism, sexism, racism, socialism, liberalism, naturalism, formism \u2026 \"Formism kills form by hugging it to death\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, after confusing everyone with that, she tweeted:\n\n\n\nIn 8th grade I was attracted to my bball coach when 1 year before, I had no such thoughts. But My body was changing. My skirt got higher\u2026\n\nWhich used her own experience as a basis for her belief for why young girls should dress in a way to attempt to quell their sexual natures and retroactively prevent men and boys from thinking of them in a sexual nature. Which, again, misses the larger point that there\u2019s nothing women can do to prevent that from happening. And that its not on the woman or girl to prevent men and boys from acting in a sexually inappropriate or criminal way against them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said this all on the same day?\n\nNo. These tweets are just a few of the dozens left over a span of a week. Which, well, let me put it this way: Kawhi Leonard just won NBA Defensive Player of the Year. But no one has ever defended anything harder than Erykah Badu defends her opinion. She\u2019s the Twitter equivalent of Dikembe Mutombo\u2019s finger-wag.\n\nSo, to be honest, I don\u2019t see a problem with Badu\u2019s tweets. It is true that men have sexual urges and that young women\u2019s attire can distract men. How is any of this a problem?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we were on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, this is where I\u2019d call a friend. In this instance, the friend would be Shamira Ibrahim, who wrote on Badu last week for VSB and has a much better answer to this than I would.\n\nFrom \u201cHow Hotep Thinking Like Erykah Badu\u2019s Robs Black Children Of Their Childhoods\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a false nuance to suggest there can be proactive measures done to help children and teenagers not get raped; a prayer cloth isn\u2019t the barrier between whether or not an adult man will make the decision to try and touch you, and I don\u2019t know what would make you think otherwise. It is hurtful and it is wrong. Normalizing the compulsion of people who are gifted with the responsibility of guarding children\u2019s lives \u2014 whether in an official capacity or a familial one \u2014 is not being \u201crealistic.\u201d It is allowing for a space in which predators can have a space in young lives. It is not a kid\u2019s job to accommodate adults in not sexualizing them. And no matter how nuanced you try to make it sound, the fact of the matter is that all roads outside of \u201ctargeting and raping children is wrong and the rapist\u2019s fault only\u201d ultimately lead to that end point.

It's a dynamic where fans (wrongly) presume the music created by these people makes them above reproach; that since their music has the appearance of being smarter than most music, the artists creating this music are smarter than most people. Naturally, this can create an air of intellectual invincibility. Where even if Badu had people around her to let her know how problematic her tweets are, she wouldn't listen.\n\nAh, I see now.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["girls", "raise", "young", "jessie", "leadership", "need", "world", "shuris", "work", "stem", "women", "tech", "black", "takes", "math", "woolleywilson"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["grant", "trust", "intelligence", "proof", "investigation", "given", "fbis", "russian", "folks", "fbi", "black", "targeting", "history", "told", "communities", "russia"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

While my mom desperately worked to scrape pennies together and get us back to Harlem, she entrusted my brother and I's care to the married couple with a young son next door. And for months I would head straight there after getting home from school, to a married couple that seemed to love themselves and keeping their family together in a way my parents never could.\n\nMaybe that was the reason why it took months for it to clock as strange that the husband also liked to have \u201cprivate\u201d time with me. I\u2019ve done the therapy and taken the time and can\u2019t really give you a definitive answer there \u2014 understanding and parsing through trauma, unfortunately, isn\u2019t really cut and dry. What I can tell you however, is that being the first born child of a conservative Muslim East African household, the bulk of this occurred while my mother (bless her well meaning heart) seemingly used Steve Urkel as her style inspiration for all of my clothing choices after the age of 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShockingly to almost no one \u2014 except apparently Erykah Badu \u2014 my mother\u2019s affinity for putting me in high-water overall jeans didn\u2019t deter a predator from targeting me. It\u2019s almost as if\u2026walk with me here guys\u2026decisions made by sexual predators and rapists aren\u2019t precipitated by whether or not they can see how recently you\u2019ve lotioned your kneecaps.\n\nRadical thinking here, I know! But hey, it\u2019s no less radical than being a neo-soul artist and mother to a son and two daughters yet earnestly thinking that there\u2019s something pragmatic in perpetuating the idea that it\u2019s natural for adult men to have attraction to \u201cwomen of childbearing age\u201d \u2014 which, if we are going by that metric, is really as young as NINE \u2014 ultimately placing the onus on young girls to curtail the potential of the male figures in their lives to not foam at the mouth at pubescent lower thighs.\n\nThis is not pragmatism. It\u2019s spreading the blame and responsibility for pedophilia to the children involved. It is robbing minors of their childhood. And, if it comes to this, victimhood. It is perpetuating this insane \u201cmen will be men and we need to accommodate for their innate nature to be savage beasts\u201d logic that has been debunked time and time again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a false nuance to suggest there can be proactive measures done to help children and teenagers not get raped; a prayer cloth isn\u2019t the barrier between whether or not an adult man will make the decision to try and touch you, and I don\u2019t know what would make you think otherwise. It is hurtful and it is wrong.\n\nNormalizing the compulsion of people who are gifted with the responsibility of guarding children\u2019s lives \u2014 whether in an official capacity or a familial one \u2014 is not being \u201crealistic.\u201d It is allowing for a space in which predators can have a space in young lives.\n\nIt is not a kid\u2019s job to accommodate adults in not sexualizing them. And no matter how nuanced you try to make it sound, the fact of the matter is that all roads outside of \u201ctargeting and raping children is wrong and the rapist's fault only\u201d ultimately lead to that end point.

Which also ultimately serves as an upsetting reminder that our default inclination to associate iconic neo-soul artists with the attribute of being \u201cwoke\u201d is not as accurate as them just being hotep as all of the fucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a tough pill to swallow that our favorite incense stick waving artists continuously miss the mark on a wide swath on substantive topics; but as the evidence accumulates, it becomes harder to dismiss. Before this most recent incident with Erykah, she took the stage at the Soul Train Awards and openly referred to renowned predator R. Kelly as her \u2018brother.\u2019 Similarly, Jill Scott has been put under fire for continuing to cast doubt on the Bill Cosby allegations - another predator - as well as generally spreading hotep meme misinformation (to admittedly hilarious response on my end). Lauryn Hill, a woman who has undoubtedly been put through the wringer by the men in her life, has used her platform to promote problematic messaging about what women should or shouldn\u2019t do to command respect.\n\nThese are all arguably mindsets that they\u2019ve held for the last 20 years. However, many of us have used the last two decades to grow and evolve in our understandings of human interaction and social conditions and realized how flawed our previous convictions may have been, while some of our treasured artistic talents have seemingly treaded water.

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["grant", "trust", "intelligence", "proof", "investigation", "given", "fbis", "russian", "folks", "fbi", "black", "targeting", "history", "told", "communities", "russia"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

Jordan. The exploits of the movie\u2019s title hero (Chadwick Boseman) and various members of his team are also throughly, lovingly captured by director and co-writer Ryan Coogler. But something does happen whenever the movie cuts over to Jordan\u2019s Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d Stevens: The scenes snap Coogler, and by extension his audience, out of the usual Marvel Cinematic Universe reverie of affection and amusement, bringing them to sharper attention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be unique to an MCU project, but it\u2019s not that unusual for Coogler\u2019s films, in part because he\u2019s a terrific filmmaker, and maybe also because all three of them\u2014Black Panther, Creed, and Fruitvale Station\u2014feature Jordan. It\u2019s not just a case of the camera loving Jordan, though he does have some of that innate star quality. Coogler seems especially fascinated by the actor\u2019s confidence\u2014his lack of obvious attempts to ingratiate himself\u2014and how that can transform the material he\u2019s given.\n\nAnd Jordan does help transform his material. None of his movies with Coogler are exactly unpredictable in terms of pure plot. This is even true of the groundbreaking Black Panther. On paper, Jordan\u2019s Erik follows an arc familiar to the MCU: He shares a semi-secret history with the film\u2019s costumed protagonist, spends his early scenes isolated from the other main characters as he gathers his resources and prepares to surprise the hero, and is pitted against that hero in a battle in which he functions as a mirror image, even donning his own panther-like supersuit.\n\nYet by handing this Marvel boilerplate over to Jordan, Coogler turns a well-worn structure into an affecting strategy. Erik\u2019s backstory, revealed well into the film, depends on his being left behind by the futuristic but closed-off country of Wakanda, abandoned in Coogler\u2019s hometown of Oakland following the death of his revolutionary father. He\u2019s one of the weightiest MCU villains, but Jordan doesn\u2019t charge straight into operatic intensity or even normal scenery-chewing. While most of the Wakanda characters speak in African-accented English that sounds regal and precise, Erik has a more colloquial American style, in which Jordan finds a wry musicality. His understated greeting of \u201cHey, auntie,\u201d directed at Wakandan royalty Ramonda (Angela Bassett), has a cultural specificity lacking from the MCU\u2019s easier laugh lines, and a human dimension sorely lacking from, say, the Red Skull. Jordan\u2019s performance depends on these small gestures, like when Erik addresses his Wakandan associates from the throne and taps his finger to betray a nervous energy behind his authority. Most supervillain performances play, with an understandable theatricality, to the audience. Jordan\u2019s speech patterns and little gestures are more self-possessed.\n\nPhoto: Black Panther (Marvel Studios/Disney)\n\nCoogler uses his gift for imagery to support Jordan\u2019s actorly choices, like the scene in which Erik approaches the Wakanda border with a crucial dead body in tow. This brief moment has a texture often lacking in comics movies, a kind of magic-hour idyll that nonetheless depicts an angry revolutionary carting around a corpse. Coogler also employs one of his favorite cinematic devices, the following shot, in which the camera pursues its subject. Killmonger isn\u2019t the only one who gets this treatment; Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa has one of his own as he approaches his crowning ceremony. But the most striking version in the movie stays on Killmonger\u2019s back, not Black Panther\u2019s. As Erik assumes the Wakandan throne, the camera begins upside down and makes a full, deliberate 180-degree turn, both a stylish image and a crystallization of the moment when Killmonger transitions from angry outsider to the man in charge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan\u2019s willingness to be still, and explode with emotion when needed, seem to embolden Coogler\u2019s nervier instincts. This was the case before Black Panther, when Coogler made another franchise movie that gave him even more stylistic flexibility. Creed, in which Jordan plays the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent-turned-buddy Apollo Creed, isn\u2019t building an expansion on an expensive, elaborate, ongoing piece of Marvel architecture, but working off of a series bible written mostly (and haphazardly) by Rocky star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. This allows Coogler and Jordan to reshape the material and make the best Rocky movie since the first one.\n\nCreed doesn\u2019t give Jordan a lot of dialogue upfront. Adonis Creed\u2019s first lines in the movie are spoken by an actor playing him as a kid, and he\u2019s first seen as an adult getting himself psyched up for a fight before the camera follows him up some stairs, mostly in shadow, and into the boxing ring. Other early scenes, all providing the character with degrees of standoffishness, rely on his seething intensity\u2014and accompanying sense of isolation. Even his first conversation with his love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), gets abruptly curtailed as she slams a door in his face.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat, subtle trick Coogler plays to maintain Creed\u2019s underdog status despite what appears to be a more privileged background than Balboa. The fact that Jordan\u2019s ultra-persistent Creed doesn\u2019t replicate the aw-shucks humility of Rocky counts as a bold gambit in a big-studio environment that demands selfless gestures, cardboard villains, children in peril\u2026 anything to score some more precious likability. Creed works so well because Jordan spends so little time asking for approval, which gives his late-movie mid-fight admission to Balboa, that he\u2019s fighting to prove that he\u2019s not a \u201cmistake,\u201d the force of a major body blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Creed\u2019s boxing legacy, the movie succeeds in keeping its characters at ground level, which Coogler emphasizes with more following shots. Some of them have a traditional boxer-into-the-ring iconic grandeur, while others, like Creed\u2019s entrance into Bianca\u2019s apartment, are more intimate, bringing the audience along with the character rather than staring in awe at his majesty. There\u2019s a similar sense of intimacy in the sequence when Coogler follows Jordan and Stallone together from a Philadelphia street, up some stairs, and around the floor of a boxing gym, simply because after a lot of scenes that isolate Jordan, the two stars share the frame for nearly the entire length of the unbroken shot.\n\nAlthough both Creed and Panther have a broader visual vocabulary, it\u2019s their following shots that forge the strongest visual connections between the earliest, least flashy Coogler/Jordan collaboration. Fruitvale Station, a dramatization of the 24 hours leading up to the real-life police shooting of Oscar Grant III, an unarmed Bay Area resident, packs a clear emotional punch, and its relevance sadly hasn\u2019t faded at all since its 2013 release. In the context of Coogler\u2019s career, though, it feels like an extremely promising tryout. Plenty of filmmakers\u2014hopefully most\u2014improve after their first film, but it\u2019s rare to find a director who can follow a Sundance indie with two straight franchise movies and have the franchise movies feel more personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Fruitvale, Coogler and Jordan haven\u2019t come to experiment or dazzle. Stylewise, the movie stays within contemporary American indie aesthetics, with lots of handheld camera and plainspoken realism (sort of Gus Van Sant lite). Jordan talks more, with a slightly Casey Affleck-ish rasp, and spells out more of his character\u2019s feelings. Most of the movie\u2019s stylistic flourishes are accordingly less sustained, part of its slice-of-life approach: Coogler\u2019s camera follows Oscar into his bedroom as he hastily cleans up and grabs some marijuana that he intends to sell; down the greeting card aisle of a store; and with handheld jitteriness as he approaches the canine victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nBut there are also distinctive if still unshowy stretches: one following shot of Oscar as he walks through his daughter\u2019s school, leading seamlessly into a brief scene with his daughter on the school\u2019s backyard playground, and another that travels with him and his friends up the escalator out of the BART system and onto the streets of San Francisco. The camera isn\u2019t constantly at Jordan\u2019s back but it scarcely lets him out of its sight\u2014a queasily effective strategy given Oscar\u2019s tragic end.\n\nThat coiled quality of waiting for a vicious inevitability lies more with the story of Fruitvale than Jordan\u2019s performance; the real-life events take over and can\u2019t provide the emotional release of an extremely fictional crowd-pleaser like Black Panther or Creed. But Jordan does get to show tremendous range of the everyday-life variety: warmth with his daughter, frustration with his limited job options, guilt over lying to his mom about using a cellphone earpiece while he drives, sly charm in a scene where he talks a shop owner into letting a couple of women in to use the bathroom. That this character\u2019s reality extends to a terrifying and violent police stop makes the movie chilling, and Jordan keeps it from feeling too much like a pure exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is in almost every single scene of Fruitvale, most of the scenes in Creed, and comparatively fewer in Black Panther. This progression would make it seem like Coogler is weaning himself off of his muse, if not for the fact that Jordan\u2019s potency only increases as their collaboration goes on. He commands the screen in Fruitvale, emerges as a real movie star in Creed, and by Black Panther does so much with his half hour or so of screen time that his presence looms over the whole movie despite barely appearing in it for the first hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the single most affecting scene of Black Panther, Coogler holds back his star, trusting him to deliver in small doses. During a dream sequence, Erik speaks to his departed father (Sterling K. Brown), and in a single cut, Coogler brings Erik back to the pre-teen age he was when his dad was killed. Their interaction continues without missing a beat, and when he cuts back to the adult Erik, still in the dream, a tear streaming down Jordan\u2019s cheek, the scared, angry kid of seconds earlier is still there in Jordan\u2019s eyes. Inserting a kid actor into the scene could come off like a filmmaking shortcut, a way to wring emotion out of the scene faster. But it works beautifully because Coogler trusts Jordan to create continuity with those shots of his character\u2019s younger self. The scene has a recognizably real-world sense of tragedy with few, if any, equals in the MCU.\n\nThis carries over into the film\u2019s action climax. As they fight for Wakanda\u2019s fate, Erik and T\u2019Challa are forcefully separated by a vibranium-powered subway that temporarily de-powers their supersuits (Star Wars diehards may recall a similar physical setup in a Phantom Menace duel). Coogler uses the strategic halt in action as an opportunity for Erik to expose his pain, his sense that the world has taken everything from him, an outburst not unlike Creed\u2019s moment of ringside catharsis. Excitingly staged fisticuffs pause for sustained heartbreak. Black Panther has some Marvel limitations, but Coogler seems excited to readjust pop touchstones while pushing Jordan to the fore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan and Coogler are both extremely talented, and will doubtlessly do great work apart. (A fourth collaboration between the two, the test-cheating drama Wrong Answer, has already been announced). Their work together so far, though, feels emboldened like the best star/filmmaker collaborations. In this case, Jordan and Coogler have been able to address aspects of being black in America in all of their movies in pretty disparate genres. Other filmmakers have treated Jordan like a more traditional star. In his movies without Coogler, including two other superhero pictures from now-disgraced director Josh Trank (the found-footage Chronicle and the most recent attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four), he\u2019s still charismatic. But his material leans heavily on that charisma, rather than pushing it beyond movie-star likability. Chronicle seems to at least understand his magnetism, but Fantastic Four strands him and the rest of the cast, while his single foray into comedy, That Awkward Moment, burdens him with the movie\u2019s most serious subplot (though he\u2019s not any worse off than the cast members who have to labor under the impression that their antics are amusing).\n\nAs Jordan becomes more famous, presumably other filmmakers will figure out how to use him more effectively and consistently. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine another director matching the thrill of Coogler and Jordan getting on each other\u2019s wavelength, modulating big stylistic leaps with subtler performance notes (and, when necessary, vice versa), digging beyond the surface pleasures of their talents. Their collective gravity brings even the biggest movies down to earth.", "keywords": ["creed", "black", "michael", "goes", "movies", "jordans", "coogler", "partnership", "jordan", "gameraising", "erik", "b", "scene", "ryan", "panther", "movie"], "polarity": 0.09555645743145742, "subjectivity": 0.4853012265512266},

I was in the Post newsroom when Jayson Blair was pushing out fake pieces for the New York Times about the Washington, D.C., sniper, and Post brass were going nuts believing that an out-of-town reporter was beating them in their own backyard.\n\nIt was Post reporters and editors who steadied the ship and assured the higher-ups that the stories Blair was producing weren\u2019t where their reporting was leading them. Those reporters and editors worked long hours, stayed later and came in on days off to make sure that everything put into print was right.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has been tireless in his attack on the media. He\u2019s called the media and the stories they\u2019ve produced \u201cfake media\u201d and claimed to be \u201cfailing\u201d any news outlet that pens a piece he doesn\u2019t find flattering about him or his administration. I can\u2019t speak for all journalists, but I can say that the people I know at the Washington Post and the institution itself don\u2019t take kindly to this presidential bashing of who they are and what they represent. To date, the Post is the only newspaper in the country that has taken down a president, and I can assure you that those reporters covering the White House would love nothing more than to do it again.\n\nLate Thursday, the Post released a scathing report that not only are Trump and his team trying to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, but they are also literally Googling for whom Trump can issue pardons and how.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how The Root got this photo, but we have actual footage of Trump Googling \u201cpardons\u201d:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post story notes that Mueller is looking deep into the Russia rabbit hole and wants all of it: Trump\u2019s taxes, Trump\u2019s business associates, his dealings with and in Russia. He wants to lay to rest the claims that Trump and/or members of his Cabinet colluded with Russia. The obvious question here is, if Trump has nothing to hide, then why is he so bothered by Mueller\u2019s investigation?\n\nThose of us who didn\u2019t vote for this large orange mass of hate know the answer in full: Trump and Russia are fucking! Like a spouse who\u2019s been cheated on, non-Trump Americans know full well when something doesn\u2019t smell right. We know that when Trump started staying late after work and trying to lose weight, he was dating Russia. We know that when Trump got a second credit card that didn\u2019t have our name on it, he was meeting Russia at a hotel downtown. We know what cheating looks like.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: Trump has brought this on himself with his boisterous tweets and his \u201cI don\u2019t have a care\u201d attitude. The walls are closing in on this wasted administration, and hopefully we can get this marriage annulled because we haven\u2019t been together that long.

(For the record, \"90 degrees in Philly\" = \"126 degrees wherever the hell else you're from\") It felt like seeing your favorite cousins and being grown at the family reunion when all of the \u201cfun\u201d aunts and uncles started having a few drinks. I didn\u2019t entirely know what to expect from my first music festival experience, but I knew The Roots were involved. And that's usually enough.\n\nRoots Picnic is different from what I\u2019ve learned to be true of other multi-stage music festivals in that the three main performance spaces are all within a few hundred feet of each other. This is mainly because of the layout of Festival Pier at Penn\u2019s Landing, where the event is held every year, but this had just as many ups as it did downs. There were a few occasions when acts overlapped (Poor DJ Diamond Kutz) and things sounded crazy, but outside of that, the show ran pretty smoothly and on time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtists like Bishop Nehru, Hiatus Kaiyote and Rae Sremmurd played shorter sets earlier in the day, while everyone\u2019s festival \u2018fits were still fresh and we weren\u2019t too heat-worn to realize that, surprisingly, we did know all the words to \"Throw Some Mo\u2019\". Later, DJ Mustard (n\u00e9e Dijon Isaiah McFarlane), A$AP Rocky with the majority of A$AP Mob (RIP Yams), and The Weeknd \u2014 who actually puts on a really good show if you\u2019re into his music \u2014- played longer sets for audiences so niche, you could easily pick them out whenever the respective artist wasn\u2019t performing. Kinda like the difference between people who go to the Greyhound station for the buses, and people who go their for the discount bagels in the sandwich shop. 80 degrees felt like too long lines for food and the bathroom, but, \u201cWait, I know this song!\u201d\n\nThe Roots took the stage at 9pm. By that time we\u2019d been standing, and sweating, and sitting, and sweating for anywhere between seven and nine hours; not entirely ready to go, but quickly nearing the threshold. When the flood lights dropped, however, and Black Thought\u2019s voice infiltrated the crowd, his question \u201cWhat are you passionate about?\u201d may as well have come from a burning bush, the way energy started flowing. They opened with an extended play of \u201cA Peace of Light\u201d from How I Got Over, and the monitor went through a chronological display of their album covers, which of course invited the response from the audience on our favorites. The Roots and Erykah Badu, individually, are fundamental elements. Collectively, their chemistry is the type of electrifying magic that makes your skin tingle and drapes you in a cloak of proud, heavy, unapologetic Blackness.\n\nThe first song they performed together was Erykah\u2019s \u201cLove of My Life\u201d, making it even more of an ode to Hip Hop by interspersing the chorus with performances of other essential Hip Hop songs. Afrika Bambaataa blessed the stage, Freeway came out to perform \u201cRoc The Mic\u201d, The Lox gave us \u201cAll About the Benjamin\u2019s\u201d, and YG brought us all together with the personal fave \u201cMy Nigga, My Nigga.\u201d After more from Badu and The Roots, including them backing The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cEarned It\u201d and Erykah dusting off an amazing \u201cGreen Eyes\u201d performance, I wholly understood why people braved the crowds, robbery-adjacent food and beverage prices, and heat to see their faves festivals every summer.

Like how can you tell that you were good without asking (is he more possessive, does he start hitting the gym more)?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've seen that a lot of men don't marry their best sex partner which is sort of a good thing, I guess. Does having goodpussy even matter to a man, or is it just how willing she is to have sex?\n\nHas good pussy ever caused you to make bad decisions (I.e. getting her pregnant, loaning large sums of money, etc.)?\n\nDoes good pussy have the same effect on men that good dick has on women?\n\nAgain, love the blog. Keep up the great work!\n\nThoughts?\n\n\u2014-Damon Young\n\nI have a couple of things to say on this but, for obvious reasons, I'll refrain. (For now)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Tunde Akinyeke\n\nDamon,\n\nYou sent this email out on the Lord's day?\n\nAlso, I think this convo should be started off by the menfolk while classy ladies such as I toss in commentary from the peanut gallery. I wouldn't even know how to jump off on this without reeking of\u2026erm\u2026vaginal hubris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Shamira Ibrahim\n\nThis exists, and the person who wrote this email has expressed the thoughts I've had since season one when she was just dealing with Fitz. Even if you were puzzled by Fitz's blind thirst for Liv in the early seasons, Jake made it perfectly clear once he entered the show: Olivia Pope has that bomb - terrorist. You think Fitz built this woman a house and wants to make jam because she's a great conversationalist or she's even the prettiest woman he's ever known? Stay woke, people.\n\nWhat this reader gets wrong is a lot of men don't marry their best sex partner. I don't even know what kind of math she used to come to that logical conclusion, but even if this was the majority, I guess I'll be chilling over here on the sidelines as an outlier. One of the reasons why I am planning on marrying the woman I'm with now is because, well, DUH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut women don't need to worry about coming in first place with regards to good pussy. All they need to do is get to the elite tier. I basically came up with this concept a long time ago, and this is the first time I've explained it but here it goes.\n\nWhen it comes to my sex partners, I don't have a first place, second, place, third place. I have tiers, groupings, sort of like a pyramid. At the very bottom there's the partners with whom it was the worst, then there's a middle section, and upper middle section, and then the top tier. This system allows for more flexibility and more fairness not only to yourself but to your partners, because everyone's grouping is based on something unique to them. The other benefit to the groupings, is it helps you properly compare people within the group when it comes to actually wanting more than sex. A past partner could be in the top tier, but over at my personality pyramid they're down in the projects. What you want is to have someone who is in the upper-middle/tippy-top of multiple pyramids. Personality, looks, sex, whatever we value the most.\n\nIn any case, kudos to the reader for staying woke. Honestly, Olivia's bomb is the elephant in the room and has been since at least season two and it's so obvious to the point where sometimes I watch and I'm uncomfortable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Jozen Cummings\n\nJozen is correct about the tiers. Although I do have classifications within the tiers.\n\nMen don't always marry their best sex partner. Hell men don't always commit to their best sex partner. It's hit or miss in my opinion. A lot of different factors besides how good a woman's pussy is plays into the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood pussy and an insufferable personality gets only late night phone calls/texts. When you get that perfect storm of good sex, great personality, good conversation, etc it's nothing to be messed with.\n\nI have done some things I am not proud of in the name of good pussy and I'll leave it there.\n\n\u2014-Tunde\n\nShamira, I started typing like three different responses before I came to the same decision. So many points for \"vaginal hubris\" LMAO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Shanae Brown\n\nTo Tunde's point, I guess I don't understand why you wouldn't marry your best sex partner. I don't even understand how a woman becomes the marrying type if they're not on the top of their charts. This goes for women too. How you all marry runner-ups in the bedroom is beyond me.\n\nAs much as we all may detest him, R. Kelly nailed this sentiment.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nI'm going to be a bit of a pussy pragmatist here. When I think about the best partners I've had, the one constant has been how much they enjoyed having sex. It wasn't so much about the pussy itself as much as how orgasmic, excited, etc the person attached to the pussy was. I've said this before (and I know other people have made this analogy) but pussy is like pizza. Most of it is good \u2014 seriously, it's good so often that the couple unquestionably bad times you had are more memorable than the good \u2014 and the difference between \"good\" and \"great\" isn't really vast enough to break your neck pursuing the great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've (obviously) never had sex with Erykah Badu, but I'd assume her effect on men is less about what's between her legs and more about her being a big booty freak who's famous and likes to fuck a lot.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nAnd \"vaginal hubris\" sounds like the medical term for a particularly bad yeast infection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nThe pizza thing is weird. Yes, Damon, most pizza is good, and it's also unremarkable . I guess yes, I'll take Papa John's. But I really don't want Papa John's. As a matter of fact, I'll never order Papa John's voluntarily. If that's what kind of pizza I end up getting, it's because that was served to me. But I ain't ever been craving some pizza and thought Papa John's would do it for me.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nI've definitely done some extremely dumb things, not only for good pussy, but pussy period. I've parked my car a mile away, jogged to and climbed into a house window in the middle of the night so my girls parents wouldnt see me. (This was high school). I've definitely driven long distances for it. But all that was in the name of pussy, without any degree of great to goodness. I presume all pussy is good by default. Because I like it, so it is good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to that good good? Look, I've long determined that the craziest women I've ever dealt with all came with the best. It's a pretty commonly held belief (maybe not perfectly for all individuals) that's held pretty true in my life. It is for that reason that I doubt I would end up married to my best sex partner. The woman that I'd easily say was the best that holds the PJ #pussytoobomb distinction is somebody I doubt I'll ever speak to again and that's a good thing. We were oil and vinegar. So while good pussy might get me, it aint keeping me. It might be good enough to throw into the air and turn into sunshine, but i aint changing my religion. Pussy comes and goes. A woman's excitement and willingness is usually what draws most guys in (I'd guess).\n\nLike Tunde said, good pussy with the personality of a firebreathing dragon with its toe caught in a mouse trap ain't worth it and is easy to walk away from.\n\nI've done it before. I'm sure I can do it again. As long as I enjoy it, I'm good. It doesn't have to be the world's greatest. But if the world's greatest comes with the world's greatest personality and a woman I'm into, then I have just won the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Panama Jackson\n\nI have no idea why, but the repeated uses of Papa John's made me bust out laughing.\n\n\u2014-Panama\n\nThat's the thing, Jozen. You're not going to pass up Papa John's. You're not going to walk into a meeting at work, see some Papa John's sitting there, and think \"Shit. This Papa John's isn't even worth my time. Giovanni's pizza is the only pizza that will satisfy me.\" You're going to eat it with a smile and be happy that someone thought to buy some pizza for the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you separate the person from the pussy, most pussy is like that. I'd say 90% of pussy is in that \"passable to good\" range, while 5% is \"great\" and 5% is so bad you'll never forget it. But the difference between good and great is like the difference between getting a 90 on a test and a 94.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nEating something because it's free and not because it tastes good is not flattering to anyone. Especially at my age, I care a lot more about what I put in my body, therefore, if I only have a limited amount of fuck-calories to divulge in, I'm not giving them to Papa John's. Maybe when I was in college? But now. I can pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, I just think the whole idea of it all being good or most of it being good gives women a reason to believe that men don't care as long as they get some and I just can't let that shit go unchecked anymore. To be completely fair, I've taken this approach with most other things that call for my body to partake in. I pay more for groceries and for coffee because I put these things in my body every single day and it deserves to have standards. Folgers is not \"just coffee\" it is brown liquid trash.\n\nPizza isn't sacred anymore and that's because a long time ago, we as a society decided that any pizza will due. That's how we got Papa John's and Little Caesars, two companies who, if they stopped making pizza, I wouldn't be upset about it one bit. I don't want to see the same thing happen to sex. The standards for sex should be sky high considering how sacred we make it.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nPreach brother preach. Most women don't want to hear this though. Their pussy is God's gift. *shrug*\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Tunde\n\nQuestion for the people who can answer this question:\n\nYou have a choice between\u2026\n\nA) A woman with the wettest, juiciest, kegelest pussy that has ever pussied but isn't very enthusiastic in the sack. She likes sex, but it's not like something she needs to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nB) A woman whose pussy has an average amount of wetness and kegel capabilities, but acts like sex with you is the best thing anyone has ever done anywhere, ever. She has a dozen orgasms, says your name in languages that don't exist yet, and even literally had the neighbors call the cops once.\n\nWho do you choose?\n\nFor me, the choice is obvious. B. And, I would assume that most men would choose B as well. Obviously, these are extreme examples, but I guess the point I'm making is that while \"great\" pussy exists, the pussy itself in a vacuum doesn't matter as much as the experience with the person connected to it. Basically, \"having great pussy\" and \"being great in bed\" are two separate things. Sometimes they overlap, sometimes they don't. And when they don't, I'm choosing \"great in bed\" every time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nMost women with that good good know they have that good good. It's a conversation that gets had. Usually starts like this \"lemme tell you what this nigga did/said\u2026\"\n\nOn a larger level, though, everyone's good good criteria ain't gon be the same because some of the factors that go into determining it can be altered depending on the chemistry between the people involved. That goes for good pussy *and* good dick\u2014a lot of it is relative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, I think amongst people who have sex with women (cause it's not just men), most heads could agree on what makes pussy \"bad\", but there'd be a wealth of answers on what makes it good\u2014hence this thread.\n\n\u2014-Huny Young\n\nI doubt any dude would take Option A over B. Enthusiasm is essential.\n\n\u2014-Tunde\n\nThe original question posed seems to equate good pussy to great in bed. Seems overly scientific to separate the two, but I feel you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nI'm taking A because I would hope in this scenario, her overall attitude towards sex isn't set in stone and when I give her this #DickTooBomb, I get the genetic attributes of the A with the attitude of a B.\n\nYou have to be careful of the B girl if only because that could have absolutely nothing to do with you, and she's enjoyed sex like that before you. Like her lifestyle is such that multiples are the norm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to Huny's point, I am specifically talking about good pussy not great in bed. I've encountered girls who can move with the best of them, but don't have that all-natural.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nIf this is gonna turn into a conversation about \"most women\" overrating themselves or the value of their vagina I'm out, though. That shit is boring. But that being said, I think women should consider themselves of high value. All *people* should consider themselves to be or at least strive to be top tier in all arenas of life. I can see how it benefits wack dudes if women don't but lemme hush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nYou could also make the argument that \u2014 if the level of wetness is the key determinating factor in making a pussy \"great\" \u2014 great pussy basically just depends on how excited the woman is to sleep with you (and whether she's ovulating). A woman who was on straight desert status for one person could have been an amazon rainforest for someone else.\n\nI'm not making this argument. But the argument can be made.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nYeah, I don't want to come across as that guy who's saying women inflate their self-worth because they're not as good as they think in bed. I'd like to state for the record, we are strictly talking about good pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Damon, that's a good argument to be made and one I tell myself in the end. I don't hold a woman solely responsible for her lack of wetness. I'm sure I had something to do with that.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nJozen, that statement was purely a response to Tunde's comment about most women thinking their shit is God's gift. That's that shit I don't like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut yeah\u2026there is no universal good pussy or good dick/great in bed. Can't be.\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nWhat you said earlier, Huny about women talking about it, I would say that means you're hip to game. If you're an adult woman who doesn't have a story about a dude turning into a straight baby when he's done or he isn't tripping, etc, that's a telling statement. It's just like when my boys and I exchange stories in our past, if I can't contribute to the highlight reel because I have no highlights, I might not be on point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nIs \"great\" pussy by itself really turning men into babies, though? Or \"decent to good\" pussy with great technique and/or a super high libido and/or a super fat ass attached to it?\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't have said \"most\" women. I don't know most women.\n\n\u2014-Tunde\n\nIf there IS a universal good pussy\u2014like a Jedi master pussy\u2014I don't think I want it. That seems like a lot of pressure. I'm fine being Ahsoka Tano out here in the world, and just striving for Luke Skywalker status with the one I'm with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nAlso I really said \"out here in the world\" like my pussy is out here in the world. My god. I shouldn't have entered (pause) this conversation.\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\n\"Decent to good\" pussy with great technique and/or a super high libido and/or a fat ass attached to it = GREAT PUSSY, though, generally speaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever have I typed pussy this many times in the span of an hour.\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nChrist, where is Maya? I feel like I'm putting myself on super front street being the only woman going in (pause) on this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nWhy can't \"great\" pussy come with great technique, a super high libido, and a fat ass attached to it? You make it sound like that's a unicorn.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nYeah, this is easily the most I've ever typed pussy. I keep wanting to type vageen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nIt can. Great pussy can come with all of that. It's just not as necessary as the other stuff when distinguishing \"decent in bed\" from \"great in bed.\"\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\n\"Hey, if you saw a unicorn, I believe you. Just saying, there's some beautiful horses out there without the horn.\" - Damon and Tunde\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nI'm only speaking hypothetically. I could tell some stories but\u2026.\n\n\u2014-Tunde\n\nI kinda feel like opening this up (pause) to the differences in criteria that may exist between women who have sex with women and men who have sex with women but once again\u2014my family gon read this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Huny\n\nYeah, Tunde, the conversation in this thread is inherently limited because, well, other people will read this, and some of us have family and/or significant others also on the thread. Plus, Thanksgiving is coming.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nYeah out of respect for #bae, who I'm sure will read this once he sees the word \"pussy\" \u2026 I'm speaking only in hypotheticals. But my initial reaction to this question was if you have to ask, you probably don't have one, or have never had one rain upon your life. Lol\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also don't think it's such an anomaly. I've never been with a woman, but from conversations and stories I've heard, either most of my friends are porn star unicorns or \u2026 well lying.

Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools. By the way, that neighbor who put up the Confederate flag subsequently became friendly. That is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust think about 1) how terrible this fucking story is and 2) how delusional Narcoleptic Shaft must be to think that it\u2019s inspiring or engaging or uplifting or anything other than proof that this nigga needs to move.

We all have a friend who has pressed pause on their bootleg DVD of Hidden Colors long enough to explain why they aren\u2019t interested in seeing the movie Black Panther because they know how Hollywood poisons the minds of our people, and what we need to do is stop dreaming about vibranium and invest our resources in uplifting our community.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of explaining how you just wanted to see some fictional cool shit with black people on the screen the same way white people get to see Harry Potter, Star Wars and The Passion of the Christ (yes, a Caucasian Jesus is more fantastical than a broom-riding white witch-boy or an evil Jedi with asthma).\n\nYou could engage in an extended argument with your friend, explaining that if black people weren\u2019t capable of separating fiction from reality, we\u2019d be waiting for Blade to kill Donald Trump, believe that the Civil War was about the North\u2019s unwillingness to serve iced tea, and think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a timid little Southern preacher who helped change the minds of the tiny percentage of white Americans who simply wanted to sit in the front seats on public transportation.\n\nLuckily, instead of listening to all that noise, you can just present your faux-tep friend with this short quiz to determine whether or not they are too woke for Black Panther.\n\n1. If you went to Wakanda, you would:\n\na) Put in an application at the vibranium mine.\n\nb) Head straight to the Foot Locker at the Wakanda Galleria for a pair of kente cloth Jordans.\n\nc) Buy a Swisher from the Walmart and roll a purple-hearted flower blunt.\n\nd) Learn the knowledge and culture and use it to liberate your people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. White people who dress up to see Black Panther:\n\na) Probably dressed up for all of the Marvel movies, so this one is no different.\n\nb) Are hilarious.\n\nc) Are tone-deaf.\n\nd) Are probably spies trying to see what they can appropriate and call their own ... except for that white girl; she\u2019s kinda thick.\n\n3.

In fact, we are so far apart that if he said the sky was blue, I would say, \u201cShut up, you orange-faced afterbirth, lying sack of Russian urine!\u201d\n\n\n\nBut I must admit that Trump\u2019s latest tweet is a good one. On Friday he confirmed that he was under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and then pointed out a rather interesting note, all in one tweet:\n\nThis tweet made me howl, for a number of reasons:\n\nIt\u2019s completely inaccurate.\n\nIt confirms that the president is being investigated for the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nIt shows why everyone inside the White House wants this jackass to stay off Twitter.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of work for one tweet.\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s break this all down. Trump is being investigated by Mueller, not Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but sources at Fake News Fox News have confirmed that this was all Rosenstein\u2019s shade to catch:\n\nRosenstein\u2019s May memo critical of ex-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s performance was among the reasons cited by Trump and others in Comey\u2019s firing. Soon after Comey\u2019s ouster, Rosenstein\u2014who had been Comey\u2019s direct superior at the Justice Department\u2014appointed Mueller, a former FBI director himself and a friend of Comey\u2019s, to lead a wide-ranging probe, ostensibly focused on Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election but also encompassing a host of allegations made against Trump and his associates.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil the president\u2019s tweet, it was unconfirmed as to whether or not the president was officially part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The tweet seems to confirm that he is, in fact, being investigated, but CNN notes that it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s text is referring to reports that he\u2019s under investigation or whether the White House received official notice that he\u2019s being investigated.\n\nWhich leads to why everyone remotely associated with Trump wants his dumb ass to stay off Twitter. It\u2019s one thing to be an incompetent leader who can hide behind an intelligent staff (see: the second Bush). But Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking directly to his followers as if he\u2019s the lead singer of a boy band is leading to more trouble.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, has to answer for his dumbass tweets, and CNN notes that she\u2019s referring inquiries into his tweets to his private attorney, Marc Kasowitz. This proves how reckless his tweeting has become: His press staff can\u2019t even answer for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for those of us who wish him out of office, this might be his best use of 140 characters. Not only did he possibly confirm that he\u2019s being investigated, but he shit on his deputy attorney general and sullied his already soiled Twitter name in 140 characters.\n\nRead more at Fox News and CNN.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "mueller", "investigation", "trumps", "comeys", "investigated", "hes", "house", "best", "trump"], "polarity": 0.12087112622826907, "subjectivity": 0.4809996220710507},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["styles", "getty", "film", "marvel", "love", "look", "veronica", "wanna", "images", "black", "style", "fashion", "wakanda", "wear"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

Basically, if you had a fake deep stage \u2014 like every. single. one. of. us. did somewhere between 1998 and 2005 \u2014 how deep was it? How far did you go? How small did your hats get? How long would you take to enunciate words? How many poems did you write, and how often did you perform? Who fell in love with the campus Mos Def doppelganger, only to find out he believed in Martians and had seven kids?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are our fake deep stories.\n\nI'll go first, because I doubt anyone will beat my story.\n\nMy fake deep stage is the reason we're all here. It's why Panama gets free lapdances in Detroit. Why Gem Jones is a YouTube superstar. Why Tonja's cheeks are known in Belize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt started in college, when I realized women liked dudes who wrote poems. And really liked dudes who wrote poems about sex. And really, really liked dudes who wrote poems about eating pussy. Since I already enjoyed writing, learning this was like finding out the bank was giving away free money. And blowjobs. Free money and blowjobs.\n\nSo I wrote poems, with titles like \"Strawberry Klondike\" and \"Stuck\", and I'd email them to friends on campus and publish them in campus periodicals. Once I got enough positive feedback with those, I started to branch out, writing poems that included lines like \"Phat Farm Jean Suit\" and \"The Modern-Day Matrix Dismemberer.\"\n\nAnd, to be honest, they actually weren't that bad. At least in comparison to some of the shit I'd see people perform. I don't even know if there's a term for that level of shitsanity. Performance fart?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, a couple years, dozens of poems, and even a few stage performances later, my cousin Sarah (I didn't know her as Huny then) caught wind of this, and offered to build a place online for me to house all my poems. She said I could even do something there I'd never heard of until this time: blog. Apparently, she was a famous blogger of some sort or something.\n\nSo, I took her up on her offer, and that lead to my first blog, dyoung.thatbitch.com\u2026which led to my second blog d.theroyalyoungs.com\u2026which led to meeting Panama and Liz\u2026which, years later, led to VSB.\n\nI double dog dare someone to come up with a better fake deep story. Because my fake deep story hasn't ended yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon Young\n\nI am so happy this is happening. I offer two preludes:\n\n1.

I wasn't about the deep poetry about the man or embracing my inner blackness. I didn't use black soap or burn incense in my dorm room (i did wear sandlewood oil on occasion). I wrote love poems (ballads). Tunde back then was basically like Raj (Big Bang Theory) around the ladies. What better way to express myself than thru words. I was such a cornball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Tunde Akinyeke\n\nThese poem titles/phrases tho, Damon.\n\nSo\u2026 if Love Jones came out in 1997, I was in 7th grade aka what some of y'all niglets called junior high (most of CPS functioned in a K - 8 cattle-type system so I didn't know junior high was a thing til I got friends from the burbs). ANYWAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy fake deep poetry stage was definitely between 7th grade til about freshie year of high school. My fake deep poems were about Morgan Freeman Himself\u2026 God. I wrote sermon poems. Like, I'd go to or watch church on TV every Sunday (shout out and RIP to the Chi church superstar, Bishop Brazier, no relation to Bishop Don Magic Juan) and write a poem about whatever chapter/verse he spoke about that day. And I just KNEW I'd get my rhyming word of God out to the masses. I knew I'd be this poem prodigy and I'd be on TV with Oprah an'nem. Turns out\u2026 no.\n\nHell, I still have that book of poems (let's talk about how one of the books is covered with a picture of a bunch of C-notes though\u2026 on some Creflo Dollar mess. That was my way of attracting dolla dolla bills with my writing, y'all). I actually re-read them every so often. Part of me cringes like hell\u2026 the other part of me be like\u2026 BARS!\n\nYaymen.\n\n\u2014-Tonja Stidhum\n\nI was born with a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde \"night & day\" personality that never allowed me to have a deep stage. I was either a cheery, earnest, nerdy optimist who's farts did not stink or a dark, cynical old person who hated everyone who had farts of depression and passive aggressive rage. The cheery side was too corny to be deep and the cynical side was too cynical to bother with the notion since \"everything sucks and nothing will ever be good so why bother?\" and \"Love Jones wasn't even that good of a movie, what's the big deal, hardly anyone is actually good at spoken word. You all look like Different World rejects.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd faux deep college dudes who wrote poetry (that was not even GOOD, mind you) creeped me out. Nope. Just closeted gay wannabe Alphas and Wu-Tang enthusiast Karate Thugs for me.\n\nMIND YOU, those dudes were not better. But that's who I dated in college. The one \"poetry\" dude I tolerated was into a chick who had a mustache due to being on Norplant. She seemed nice. *side eye*\n\nI also wrote poetry, like a ton of it, but I wrote poetry from age six all the way into my early 30s. (Hipster Danielle: \"I was into Langston Hughes, Paul Lawrence Dunbar and Phyllis Wheately at 9 when all y'all was still trying to learn the lyrics to 'Rumpshaker.\") This did not mean I was deep. (NEEEERRRRDDDDDD!!!!) It just meant I really liked writing and for a long time, liked poetry even though I hate most other people's poetry from that 90s period when everyone wrote it. Then poetry wasn't cool anymore. (People. Ruin. Everything. Leave me and my Gwendolyn Brooks alone)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I don't know about all y'all, but my poetry was and still is good. Writing crap is HOW I MAKES MY LIVINS. I would hope if I'd done it since kindergarten and read \"A Dream Deferred\" enough it would eventually not be crap. All I do is write and write more and write more in the hope that it will not be crap. You are all writers. OWN THE FACT THAT YOU DO THINK YOUR SHITTY POETRY FROM COLLEGE WAS GOOD! Considering everyone was writing crappy poetry then, and you're a legit writer who was writing poetry, you were probably the best poet you knew on campus. Lawd knows I was the best poet on my fake deep college campus. I was the best writer everything there. King Kong ain't got shit on me. (In writing.)\n\n\u2014-Danielle Belton\n\nSo here's my run down:\n\nMy Fake Deep came in three waves (heh). I had my nose (re)pierced each time.\n\n2001\u2026 BlackPlanet name \"giftedsista\"; read Pedagogy of the Oppressed, No Disrespect, and They Came Before Columbus; thought Bamboozled was Spike's magnum opus.\n\n2005\u2026 wrote Common Be lyrics all over my mirrors (physically on the mirrors, no post-its); had a poem called \"My G-Spot is the God in Me\"; took every Black Studies class possible at San Francisco State\u2014SFSU was the first nonHBCU in the nation to have a Black Studies department thanks to Danny Glover in the 60s so you could literally take ANYTHING with Black emphasis\u2014English, Psychology, Journalism, Dawn of Science.\n\n2008\u2026 \"divinity rules everything around me; dream\" on my MySpace profile; MySpace neosoul profile song switched every single day game so strong; it was 2008 and I was still actively updating my MySpace; read all The Secret books and was a walking \"The Universe only gives us what we allow it to\" tweetgram, nearly got into a car accident every time a new Andr\u00e9 3000 verse dropped; boyfriend at the time hand-stitched his own dreadlocks (cut during pledging and still in his house) into a stocking cap to give me an Andr\u00e9 3000 in the \"Otherside of the Game\" video replica Build-a-Bear that played \"She Lives in my Lap\" when the paw was squeezed; I wrote the color of my aura down everyday on my calendar\u2014the colors were even more annoying than everything I've described above (Cinderella Blue, Avocado, Garrafeira Port Wine Burgundy).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO, interweaved throughout all of this was my authentic \"I can recite Trina lyrics like the Pledge of Allegiance\" ratchetness with NO IRONY.\n\nFuck wit meh.\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nOh I forgot, in high school (Oakland Tech, #lynchmob #beastmode) I was part of an alternative education group called TryUMF (Trying to Uplift My Folks).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nI think \"She Lives In My Lap\" is an underrated fake-deep anthem. One because it's a great fucking song. It's almost psychedelic. I don't smoke, but I get high when I hear it. Most importantly, I'd bet it's on a higher percentage of fake-deep playlists than any other song, including \"Round and Round\", \"Umi Says\", and the audio version of Toni Morrison's Jazz.\n\nAnd Christina, I want to invent a time machine just so I can go back in time, join TryUMF, become president of the group, hold a meeting in a classroom after school, and not show up while y'all waited for hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nThe TryUMF pledge\n\nBy Darrick Smith, 1999 .\n\nIn the midst of dropping GPAs\n\nand disrespectful displays\n\nOf ignorant melees,\n\nSignaling the waste of each day\n\nComes a light out of the sky\n\nThat light is I\n\nBrighter than the sun,\n\nYet missed by the eye\n\nFor this light is not for sight\n\n'Cause its glow is far too bright\n\nChocolate smiles erupt with my own\n\n'Cause they know this light represents the home\n\nFocus, intense heat, and flames\n\nThis must be the sight\n\nit's TryUMF time,\n\nShine baby, shine\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\niDied to the sound of a thousand poetry slam snaps at that pledge.\n\n\u2014-Tonja\n\nI didn't have a very long \"fake deep\" stage. I was too busy rounding out my bougie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever. These things did happen:\n\n(1) Classical piano training turned abhorrent songwriting, in part because Alicia Keys (briefly) made piano cool again.\n\n(2) The movie Poetic Justice inspired the \"lemme get this breathy whisper voice down for when I'm on the phone with dudes\" phase, complete with box braids and the one time where I totally remixed my namesake's poem \"In A Time.\" Hubris is so dangerous, y'all.\n\n(3) Being from Philadelphia, I was in the neo souling-black soap using-crunchy granola-verbose-nigga homeland. And as such, went tirelessly in search of spoken word venues so that both the writer and the poser in me could be equally satisfied.\n\nBut none of this lasted too long, 'cause Whitley.\n\n\u2014-Maya Francis\n\nYou sure \"Darrick Smith\" wasn't really a teenaged Wale?\n\nAnd yea, I'm rolling with Danielle now. My shit was good. Great, dammit. Sure, some of it makes me want to crawl beneath a concrete stoop, but some of it actually had some high-level-ass alliteration and assonance. I was the Western Pennsylvanian Pharoahe Monch. (In my head.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST TOPIC EVER.\n\nMy fake deep stage is too deep for two reasons:\n\nA) it wasn't fake. (My poems were awesome dammit)\n\nB) it hasn't completely ended.\n\nOnce the Comcast man leaves in an hour or so and I have internet I shall have a longer response. I feel like Christina and I would have been \"soul sistas.\" Lmao.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time in my life where \"Chakras\" and \"aura\" was a part of daily lexicon and a poetry spitting man with locs would just melt me. Some of my best friends on the planet STILL make their living traveling the country performing spoken word with names like Versus, King Wise, Legacy and Future. And they are damn good. Like great, amazing writers.\n\nI miss my poetry writing, Erykah Badu headwrap, thousand silver bangles and ankh ring wearing days.\n\n\u2014-Shanae Brown\n\n\u2026.::::I CAN FEEL YOUR ENERGY FROM TWO PLANETS AWAY, SHANA\u00c9, YAAAAS!::::\u2026.\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nLMAO. I just about died reading this silverglove blackplanet page.\n\nI hope mine is deleted. I had fake deep blackplanet, xanga and myspace pages. They all had rotating neo soul and incense rap playing in the background. \"Mind Sex\" was my fav. \"African princess, tell me your interest. Wait let me guess boo, you probably like poetry\u2026\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLol. Ah the memories.\n\n\u2014-Shanae\n\nYou all ain't fake-deep, you're fake fake-deep.\n\nAs for me, behold, the realest fake-deep person you ever met.\n\nAll this mention of Love Jones, quoting \"Blues for Nina\" and shit. Fuck outta here. What you all know about \"Click Clack\"?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm so fake-deep, I liked \"Love Jones\" too, then I rented Slam at my local Blockbuster and my third-eye was open. \"Love Jones\" was Hollywood glam compared to the gritty rawness of \"Slam.\" Darius Lovehall had a job and did poetry in his spare time. You know what Ray's job was in \"Slam\"? Poet.\n\nYou all think your fake-deep? \"Love Jones\" comes in the fake-deep starter kit. \"Slam\" is what you get when you officially have become fake-deep.\n\nI'm so fake-deep, when I was in high school, I was in College Prep English courses, and asked to transfer to the intermediate English course. You know why? Because in the intermediate English Course they were reading \"Things Fall Apart.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm so fake-deep, I wanted to go see \"Sister Act 2\" because Lauryn Hill was in it. I blasted \"Love Supreme\" by John Coltrane from my car like it was Juvenile's \"Ha.\"\n\nI'm so fake-deep, I had a poster of Erykah Badu on my wall because I thought her mind was sexy.\n\nI'm so fake-deep, I wore a kufi.\n\nYes, a kufi.\n\nI'm so fake-deep, I wrote this like a poem just to let you all know the fake-deep inside of me was authentic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Jozen Cummings\n\nI rocked a beige coufie on and off for a year. I'd switch between that and a Burberry bucket. I was very confused.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nFAKE FAKE DEEP?! FAKE FAKE DEEP?!\n\nBreh\u2026.\n\nI had a MySpace poem called \"He Wears a Magnum XL\" dedicated to Barack Obama, Huey P. Newton, Teacake from Their Eyes Were Watching God, and Walter Lee from A Raisin in the Sun. Black Ice from Def Poetry messaged me about that shit. I win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nDamon is right though, once you date a dreadlocked poet and find out he's married with two kids while he's out every night at open mics getting all in every \"Queen's\" chakras\u2026\n\nI learned to stay away from poets with locs. So much ain't shitness.\n\n\u2014-Shanae\n\nMy first year as a 9th grade English teacher, I constructed an entire curriculum around the first two seasons of Def Poetry. I had at-risk 14 year olds doing homework on Taylor Mali and Suheir Hammad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nThis is great. Everyone was so terrible. I had an early Fake Deep Phase in 2000 when I found Tupac's A Rose That Grew From Concrete. Poetry book. Whoo. I felt like I had just found Eat, Pray, Love and had been set free, born anew and shit. I started writing poems about relationships I had never ever ever been in or witnessed, printing them and storing them in a shoebox, AFTER I sprayed them with my Dad's cologne. I had seen that in a movie or some shit. I would bring them to school on occasion, then about 15-years-old, and would whip em out during some convos on some, \"Oh, he cheated on her? Wow, I wrote a poem about that.\" I would just happen to have multiple copies on hand. Awful.\n\nThe poems were terrible.\n\nI also just dug through my photobucket account and found a memento of life at 19. 2003. I was running my dance company, was as gay as pink footies and purple contact lenses, and had just started to appreciate incense. I was still wearing Kelis' Wanderland the fuck out, and was newly obsessed with Donnie's The Colored Section and Alicia's The Diary of Alicia Keys. I used to send text dudes with Alicia Keys lyrics (\"Call 286-4991 and IIIIIII'll be here,\" I remember using once) and flood my Blackplanet page with Tupac and Musiq Soulchild quotes. So between being gay as all fuck and convinced I was smarter than everyone, I was either wearing 12 outfits at once in hopes of looking like a Janet dancer ooooor taking creepy and ridiculous Blackplanet photos like the attached, and putting a vague, unrelated song lyric underneath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI secretly wanted to be a neo soul singer. No, I cannot sing. But I was gonna be the most dancingest, most profound chewstick and essential oil nigga in history. This photo perfectly encapsulates my sensitivity and my ridiculousness. The Janet-approved half-glove. The baby locs and the ever-present loc tam. The early-2000s colored shades. I was insufferable.\n\nThis was my main Blackplanet image. I used to pull the niggas with this. (IT. WORKED.) It was the worst of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n-\u2014Alex Hardy\n\nMy old screen name wad \"Dreaded One.\" I was damn proud of that double entendre.\n\n\u2014-Alex\n\nI\u2026I have no words.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nDonnie was the broke version of Dwele. Do you all realize how broke that is, to be the broke version of Dwele?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, also, I was so fake-deep, when I finally got Internet, what did I go searching for? Slum Village's Fantastic VOLUME 1.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nI used to send blank text messages to let niggas know I was just thinking about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then I wrote a fake haiku about it.\n\nto know better but not do so better quite yet (too nostalgic for haiku)\n\nsometimes i send blank text messages\n\ni ain\u2019t got nothin to say\n\ni was just thinking about you\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nDonnie has sold about one album in his career for each person on this email thread.\n\n\u2014-Alex\n\nYou know? All this is convo is confirming I truly was a nerd. I would have hated all of you in college, getting into poetry and soul music when it was cool when I got teased for liking the same crap (but with no Nia Long making it look cute to protect me) for 80 percent of my youth. Def Poetry Jam? Saul Williams? ALL MY FAVORITE BLACK POETS DIED A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN! And I stanned for them. I stanned for them hard even though it made me look weird and caused me to make zero out of zero friends. But if Lorenz Tate does it? Oh, oh now it's cool. Oh you want to \"introduce\" me to Issac Hayes' \"Hot Buttered Soul\" when I'd been listening to it since birth!!!!! Screw you, crappy 90s poetry guy. I'ma gonna date this thug just to spite you!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*adjusts hipster glasses* *stares at old copy of James Weldon Johnson's \"God's Trombones\"* *cries*\n\n\u2014-Danielle\n\n?I was a sexy Black Panther for Halloween 2006 (the 40th Panther anniversary). I had on stripper heels and an ankh charm, my fro turned into a jheri curl cause Hyphy Movement, I was confused, and I WIN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nI have words now.\n\nAs you all know, I'm engaged and shit now. But, a long-ass time ago, I was engaged before. I was young and stupid and she had big tiddies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, how did I meet this woman? I was in a library. On a Saturday. A Saturday afternoon in the summer. She was there, studying and shit. And cute. Instead of talking to her, I found a notecard, wrote this haiku on it\u2026\n\nGirl in library\n\nstudies intensely, while guy\n\nthinks about approach\n\n\u2026put my name and number on the back, handed it to her, and walked out.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nMy husband's first gift to me was ORIGINAL SHEET MUSIC for Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Lady.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand a carved reed whistle because Ajax bought Sula one in Sula after she tied a green ribbon in her hair cause she was dickmatized.\n\nI will not lose this. As an individual or couple.\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nI printed copies of Langston's \"Mother to Son\" and taped them to all the doors in our house in protest after my Nintendo64 privileges were revoked, putting \"Life for me ain't been no crystal stair\" in like size 40 font. I knew I was on some revolutionary shit. They were maddest that I had wasted all that ink. #DeepnessFail\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Alex\n\nLMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE CHU, ALEX!!!!!!!!\n\n\u2014-Christina\n\nSee, that's the thing, Christina. Your fake deep actually seems too deep to be fake. It's like the undercover agent who's so far undercover that he turns criminal. You're basically In Two Deep. (Was that a triple entendre?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, my fake-deepness was totally fake. I mean, I thought it was real at the time. But, I used to do poetry slams while rocking this shirt. Spoken word + D&G = Fake Deep G.O.A.T.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nLOL this thread is so hilarious because i have so many commonalities with many of the stories. I wasnt fake deep tho. I was more like kiddie-pool deep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo 1997 may have been the year of Love Jones to some of yall niggas. But for me, it was the year Baduizm (and Live) dropped - and changed my life. Upon first seeing Erykah Badu's video \"On & On\" I felt like Erykah and I were kindred spirits. And when \"Tyrone\" was released? OMG I'd died and gone to conscious Black soul sista heaven, greeted with golden headwraps, Ankh necklaces, and assorted incense bundles. I was a very cynical adolescent (my mom called me and my friend Daria and Jane) and always felt like my peers were too immature and stupid to \"get\" me. I was too good for these knuckle heads and it was a waste of breath to try and relate to such plebeians. Who gave this niggas permission to rearrange me? I work at pleasing me cuz I can't please you niggas. YES! Badu knew me!! And I knew her! Hell, I had studied Kemet/Ancient Egypt in my spare time (like, I seriously tried to become \"fluent\" in writing/reading hieroglyphics). So naturally I became obsessed with buying every ankh piece of jewelry I could get my hands on (I couldn't fuck with incense, because #asthma). I was righteous, conscious, and painfully pretentious. And since I had been an award-winning poet since 5th grade (no lie) I felt it only necessary to take my poetry writing to another level - write more about the Creator, ciphers, and Shazza-type dudes (still can't believe I had a thing for light skint, light eyed dudes smh), and put that shit on the internet. My neighbor was a tech geek and built me a website in earthy tones (because #BlackPride) with images of my newest muse E. Badu and ankhs. I went by the name MzLyric for a time before switching to MizMocha on my ankh-covered BlackPlanet page. I considered myself too self-aware to \"conform\" but I had a BP page to spread my knowledge with others because #eachonereachone and shit. Oddly enough, the faux-deep African musk scented rabbit hole as a poetry-writing teen led me to becoming a bougie ratchet blogging adult.\n\n\u2014-Gem Jones\n\nFake deep? Like writing/performing slam poetry, calling Black men king, using the word \"overstand\" (Nasir taught me), smoking beedis, and/or twisting my hair into Badu-like headwraps? I went to Howard University, bitches. I was the Osirus of pretentiousness. I don't wanna call it fake depth because it felt mad authentic to me at the time. I wanna roll my eyes into the ether when I think back on it, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Damon mentioned, I ran a pretty popular website back in the day called thatbitch.com (because \"taking back\" the word bitch was my variety of militancy back in the early 00's). One of my cousins who frequented my site and read my writing showed me some of Damon's poetry. I remember thinking our poems \"felt\" similar; we had the same style, so I got his email from our family mailing list and contacted him. We weren't tight back then at all, so I didn't know much about him other than he was quiet, had an egg-shaped head and was always playing basketball. But stumbling across his pretentious-ass poetry and reaching out to him did indeed lead me to building him his first website. He was my padawan. Now look at him. Editor-in-Chief'in. *points to self* Me, nigga, me. I made you.\n\nSo this is an excerpt from one of my old poems I found. This was probably in the vicinity of 2001. Prepare yourselves, for there is no greater example of Love Jones-inspired ridiculousness than this:\n\nI don't wanna breathe without you baby\n\nand waste breath on hollow seconds\n\nyou're in my pores and leaking out my skin, I'm stopped up\n\nshit is madness; I got you-induced asthma\n\nI got a you-induced virus swimming in my blood plasma\n\nI'm tryin to do you so good you feel ashamed of yourself for letting\n\nme do you that good\n\nbite my lip til its raw and swollen good\n\nand cheap like hollywood\n\nyou fuck me like fucking me to submission is the last hope for all humanity\n\nwe can fuck love sexy\n\nthen immediately after dream up names for the three seeds I wanna\n\ncarry in my belly with your last name\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSEEDS! I said seeds, y'all. Jesus.\n\n(Sidenote: I took that picture of Damon in the D&G shirt. He loved that uglass shirt)\n\n\u2014-sarah huny young\n\nYeah Damon, your fake deep was super fake.\n\nChristina, that's an amaaaazing first gift. And that nye look is all the things.\n\nBack when I dated fake deep dudes my fav first date was one in which a poetry/hip hop culture professor (with locs of course) who wrote a book on hip hop gave me Ferlinghetti's Poetry as Insurgent Art and Jack Kerouac's Belief and Technique for Modern Prose as mementos of our date. This is after we'd spent the whole night discussing James Baldwin, Gwendolyn Brooks and Mos def while listening to \"Brown Skinned Lady.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan't make that up. Talk about all the fake deep swooning.\n\nWe had an argument once in which he said he couldn't \"exist in this negative moment.\" Lmao.\n\n\u2014-Shanae\n\nNae, you so hotep.\n\n\u2014-Maya\n\nWait, I'm just seeing Christina's husband's BlackPlanet page. I SNORT laughed. That is GOLD and makes me enormously happy and equal parts sad that I deleted mine. \"You have experienced Silverglove, and he has experienced you.\" yassssss. All this is missing is \"Leave a message in my G-spot.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention I also went through a tarot card phase. Like I had multiple decks. Osho Zen Tarot was my fave. I think this corresponded with me dating a man who studied Dr. York. If you don't know who Dr. York is you were neverrrrr fake deep. Stop it.\n\nAnd Jozen mentioned \"Slam\"\u2026listen. To this day? When I finish a website? I say \"I AM THAT NIGGA, I AM THAT NIGGA, I AM THAT NIGGA, I AM THAT TIMELESS NIGGA.\" Because Saul Williams.\n\nAnd I owned this album and pretty much quoted it constantly for two years straight. Are we tusslin' now? This is a deep-off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-huny\n\nAight\u2026finally\u2026THE CHAMP IS HERE. Which is kind of a pun considering and shit. Mostly, I'm just gon' add my fake deep because it was some high quality shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo..\n\n\u2026(deep niggas use elipses because they are never quite finished with their thoughts)\u2026I went through a deep phase. I went to an HBCU (Morehouse WHAT WHAT) and I think it's required of all HBCU face ass niggas to be deep at least for a spell. Shouts to my Spelman sister, Gem. While I was at Da 'House, I had a telemarketing job because thats what we did back in the 99 while were taking over into 2000. While I was working at this particular telemarketing firm, there was this queen named Amina, height 5'7\", caramel complected, body like heaven working there. Stereotypical as fuck with the headwraps and requisite gap in her teeth while wearing ankh rings and Sankofa trampstamps. This was before trampstamps were even a thing. She was a head of the game.\n\nSo, there was this uber lame ass nigga named Jeffery who worked with me who'd write poetry and it sucked. Like, Superhead meets Pinky at a Vacuum convention style sucked. Well she'd read it and say it was deep. And I was dumbfoudned. I decided that if fuckboy suckboy could write deep shit that I would too. So I remember writing some Shakespearingly tragic non-sense about triangles and I'm pretty sure my actual poetry could fit into the Pythagorean Theorem. Wait\u2026what? Exactly. It all sucked but the deep, headwrap and gap toothed chicks loved it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, one day - and this is where it goes from being fake deep to being like actual deep - I stopped giving a fuck what the chicks I'd never sleep with thought and began using my poetry as a means of getting out aggression. Mind you, I was a 19 year old college student/d-boy trying to keep his name out the papers and trying to get his emotions out in some way, spape, or form. I stopped showing my poetry to my co-workers and started chronicling in Mead notebooks, to the point where I have at least 5 notebooks that are filled from front to back with my writings. So I stayed deep, but it went from non-sense to actual relief and real shit my nigga. The non-sense of it all lasted for a solid 3 weeks. The truth and honest revealing of my own thoughts lasted for years. I got a lot out of my soul that way. I became a better person. And Damon's story about \"it's still going on\" would be hella suspect if he ever spit that shit at cypher. Point is\u2026I was only fake deep for a minute til I realized my true calling\u2026\n\n\u2026stuntin' on hoes.\n\n*bows*\n\n\u2014-Panama Jackson\n\nAlso, my fake deep phase, though ended via my story and I took it serious HAS translated into my ability to spit non-sensical freestyle spoken word off the top of my head in a moment's notice about anything at any time. I have absolutely been called on my claim and delivered every time. I can spit \"fallacy of reality\" with the best of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo my current fake deep is all for show when motherfucks pretend they don't know what time it is with my spitfire game. Ain't nobody comin' to see Otis, but Panama\u2026motherfucks comin' to see me my niggas.\n\nI don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. That's how deep I am.

And realized way too late that Ryan is really not the one.\n\nNormally, in the black community, I feel we have a good idea of people not to test. We don\u2019t test our grandmothers, we usually don\u2019t test that one auntie who will ruthlessly clap back, etc.\n\nAlas, Patton, a black conservative and an event planner who somehow landed a job in the Trump administration at HUD without any prior housing experience, apparently doesn\u2019t have that sense of self-preservation and decided to come for Ryan, who is really that auntie.\n\nIt all started when Patton, who heads a regional HUD office overseeing New York and New Jersey, decided that it was a good idea to call Ryan \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d during a Twitter argument.\n\nThe now deleted tweet also had the hashtag #BankruptBlogger.\n\nApparently, according to the New York Daily News, the spat started when Ryan appeared on CNN and spoke about how she and other reporters have received death threats as a result of the president\u2019s attacks on the press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatton, who planned Eric Trump\u2019s wedding before she was appointed to HUD, took to Twitter to brush aside Ryan\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative black female who has publicly worked for & supported @realDonaldTrump, I\u2019ve been getting death threats from fellow minorities on the left for the past 3 years \u2014 so welcome to the club. @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe two continued to go back and forth before Patton fired the final shot: \u201cI hear #MissPiggys still on a rampage. Gee, I must\u2019ve struck a nerve, @AprilDRyan! #BankruptBlogger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout an hour later, Patton came to her senses, tweeting out an apology.\n\n\u201cI deleted my last tweet by choice. No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote in the tweet. \u201cMy parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apology came a little too late, though. Because, remember, Ryan is really not the one you should try. This is the same reporter who has fearlessly stood her ground amid the disrespect she has faced while reporting on the Trump administration. This is the same reporter who casually asked Donald Trump \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at the White House.\n\nSo naturally, Ryan responded with a swift and expert level of clapback-ery that had me clutching at my pearls and probably made Queen Rihanna of Clapbacks proud.\n\nFirst, because Ryan is a classy reporter, she of course had to fact-check Patton. She basically pulled a #FakeNews on a Trump official, and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, when you\u2019re an event planner suddenly turned housing official, there are some receipts that have to be read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, leaving no stone unturned, as a proper reporter should, especially in a dragging, Ryan hit her with the \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d while seamlessly @ing Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been accused of threatening Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, with a Mariah Carey level of shade, she wrapped it all up with a smooth, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nBut seriously, all drama aside, it is unthinkable that an official representing a presidential administration would conduct herself that way. Then again, everything is unprecedented and game in this administration, it seems, so perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, political pundit Armstrong Williams tweeted out to Ryan that he had spoken to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a longtime friend, who had attempted to reach out to Ryan on Thursday morning to apologize.\n\nRyan missed the call but is sure to follow up because, again\u2014and hopefully for the last time so these people can know\u2014April Ryan is NOT the one.", "keywords": ["test", "housing", "administration", "reporter", "trump", "realizes", "miss", "ryan", "hud", "calling", "apologize", "tries", "patton", "late", "official", "really", "piggy"], "polarity": 0.03126306165099268, "subjectivity": 0.4200148032044584},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

Not only did he train in both internal medicine and pediatrics, but he continues to practice as a primary care physician in internal medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond of all, the CEO of Johns Hopkins is a molecular immunologist who did a postdoctoral fellowship in biochemistry.\n\nThird of all, shut the fuck up, Ben Carson.\n\nI\u2019m sure you are still feeling some type of way about how Rep.

You got your ignorant ass up there and tried to sass Al Green and talk in circles, and basically came out looking like the chump you are.\n\nI want to call you a bunch of names that I promised my bosses Danielle Belton, Genetta Adams and Yesha Callahan I wouldn\u2019t use in my posts, so instead, I will just say this:\n\nYou got set up, good sir.\n\n(\u201cGood sir\u201d is the two-word phrase I use in mixed company instead of the n-word.

Donald Trump hooked you up the bomb. HUD is about to make huge cuts that are going to impact people who look like you and come from the same background as you but don\u2019t have the same opportunities that you had\u2014and you, good sir, are going to be the face of those cuts.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you are either unaware of or uneducated about these cuts and how they are going to affect the people who depend on housing vouchers to live.\n\nYou, good sir, tried to convince people that your background as a poor black child was enough to help you understand the plight of people in the inner city, but just like many good sirs who leave the hood and start living a different life, you forgot where you came from.

When the dumpster fire that is this administration burns down to ashes, people are going to remember who did what to whom, and you, good sir, will be the face of the department that shit on and displaced poor people who couldn\u2019t afford better housing.\n\nWhen that day comes, and it will, the reckoning is going to be swift and furious. I won\u2019t feel sorry for you when that happens.

Already, the massive storm\u2014the largest ever recorded in the Atlantic\u2014is pummeling every island in the Caribbean that comes across its path. It is unclear just how much devastation it will bring, but forecasters and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have offered scenarios nothing short of terrifying.\n\nThis hurricane season has shown itself to be quite the nightmare, but one\u2019s fears only heighten after considering this nugget that makes this scenario all the more spine-chilling: Ben Carson is in charge of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, the brain surgeon who sounded like a damn fool throughout the entire Republican presidential primary season. To his credit, he sounded like a damn fool before the primary, given that he would do things like compare Obamacare to slavery, along with other random acts of asininity. Ben Carson, who often just stands there for decoration\u2014probably because he was a neurosurgeon and self-help-book writer who somehow became the head of a federal agency despite having no experience in government, much less housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in March, Carson gave his first speech to his new department and made HUD employees take a \u201cniceness pledge,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nDuring that same speech, he also said this, according to New York magazine:\n\n\u201cEvery human being, regardless of their ethnicities, or their background, they have a brain: the human brain. It remembers everything you\u2019ve ever seen, everything you\u2019ve ever heard. I could take the oldest person here, make a little hole right here on the side of the head, and put some depth electrodes into their hippocampus\u2014and stimulate\u2014and they would be able to read back to you, verbatim, a book they read 60 years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t overload the human brain,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cSo we need to focus a little less on what we can\u2019t do and a little more on what we can do. After all, this is America, the \u2018can-do society\u2019 \u2014 not the, \u2018what can you do for me\u2019 society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson\u2019s first speech was to ask employees to take a niceness pledge while arguing against government handouts. This nitwit didn\u2019t even pass his own pledge of kindness.\n\nA month later, Politico reported:\n\nCarson told Politico that policy proposals are in the works, but in public appearances the one-time presidential candidate is sticking to his stump-speech staples. He prescribes \u201cgodly principles\u201d as a cure for the country\u2019s political division and praises housing advocates for \u201cputting God\u2019s love into action.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of God, which I love to do; quite frankly, he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Carson said on March 28, drawing friendly laughter during a speech to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. \u201cWe should be grateful that God gave us variety. But you know what he didn\u2018t give us variety in? The brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe month after that, NPR reported:\n\nOn Wednesday night, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 whose budget to help low-income households would be cut by more than $6 billion next year \u2014 added his own thoughts. He said in a radio interview that \u201cpoverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.\u201d Carson \u2014 who himself grew up in poverty to become a widely acclaimed neurosurgeon \u2014 said people with the \u201cright mind set\u201d can have everything taken away from them, and they\u2019ll pull themselves up. He believes the converse is true as well. \u201cYou take somebody with the wrong mind-set, you can give them everything in the world [and] they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson tried to clarify his comments, but, spoiler, he repeated the same sentiment with phrasing that was the Tia to its original statement\u2019s Tamera. Not even Tahj or Tavior Mowry, but Tamera.\n\n\n\nOn the Monday following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall and the historic rainfall it quickly brought to Texas, Secretary Carson released a statement assuring that HUD would be there for victims in need.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] begins to assess the damage and respond to the immediate needs of residents, HUD will be there to offer assistance and support the longer-term housing recovery efforts,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat followed was a bulleted list of HUD\u2019s efforts, but one wonders, can Carson get any of it done? This question is spurred not only by Carson\u2019s own past remarks but also by a new report outlining just how poorly run HUD is under Carson\u2019s leadership.\n\nDays before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ProPublica published \u201cIs Anybody Home at HUD?,\u201d which highlighted the decimation of a vital federal agency under Carson.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis noted that now-former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d back in February. The administration\u2019s initial budget called for deep cuts to HUD\u2014cuts the Washington Post\u2019s Lisa Rein highlights \u201cwould slice away funding for long-term preparedness efforts, many of them put in place to address the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 45 picked the perfect person to run an agency for which he and those around him have great disdain.\n\nAs MacGillis reports, the plan is going exactly as it is designed:\n\nAs I watched the hearings, it occurred to me that Carson was the perfect HUD secretary for Donald Trump, the real-estate-developer president who appears to care little for public housing. He offered a gently smiling refutation to accusations from any corner that the department\u2019s evisceration would have grave consequences. After all, Ben Carson had made it from Detroit to Johns Hopkins without housing assistance, a point of pride in his family. Not to mention that Carson\u2019s very identity \u2014 theoretically \u2014 helped inoculate the administration against charges of prejudice. (Just last week, Carson said, in the wake of racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, that the controversy over Trump\u2019s support of white supremacists there was \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d and echoed the president\u2019s \u201cboth sides\u201d language when referring to \u201chatred and bigotry.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd like 45, Carson keeps family around where they don\u2019t belong:\n\nThen there was the mystery of why Carson\u2019s family was taking such a visible role in the department. There was the omnipresent Mrs. Carson. Even more striking, however, had been the active role of the secretary\u2019s second-oldest son. Ben Carson Jr., who goes by B.J. and co-founded an investment firm in Columbia, Maryland, that specializes in infrastructure, health care and workforce development, was showing up on email chains within the department and appearing often at headquarters. One day, he was seen leaving the 10th-floor office of David Eagles, the new COO, who was crafting a HUD reorganization to accompany the cuts.\n\nAn anonymous source told ProPublica of Carson: \u201cPeople feel disrespected. They see Carson and think, I\u2019ve been in housing policy for 20 or 30 years, and if I walked away, I would never expect to get hired as a nurse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Carson is a religious zealot who makes the mistake of personalizing poverty in a way that is detrimental to those who know that for every rarity that is Ben Carson, there are many others who continue to languish in a system designed to keep them stuck where they are.\n\nIn reality, more often than not, people have to be given opportunities to get out of poverty. They need adequate housing, they need support and they need a helping hand. Even if Carson is a brain surgeon who doubles as a village idiot, one would think even he would understand that the difference between him and the man who gave him a job for which he is unqualified had everything handed to him\u2014which promised him a much more certain fate than Carson had as a child.\n\n\n\nIt was already worrisome that a man who thinks poverty is a state of mind was in charge of an organization designed to help the poorest among us. It\u2019s even worse now that the poorest of Houston have been affected by a natural disaster, only to seek refuge in an organization that lacks staffing, resources and competency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHUD is supposed to rebuild homes, parks, hospitals and community centers. Carson behaves as if he couldn\u2019t build a paper plane at his office in their building. How petrified should most of them be?\n\nIn response to the story, Carson said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 Special Report: \u201cI would say that you should ring the doorbell before you conclude that nobody\u2019s at home. I don\u2019t think they did a very good job at journalistic investigation there.\u201d\n\nWell, this is your chance to show and prove, you brain-dead brain surgeon. I don\u2019t have much faith in you, but for the sake of my home state of Texas, Florida and whatever other areas are affected, I\u2019m praying you don\u2019t fuck up.\n\n", "keywords": ["hurricane", "victims", "petrified", "need", "ben", "head", "carson", "speech", "hud", "housing", "state", "brain", "poverty"], "polarity": 0.11839024423136571, "subjectivity": 0.449990424943696},

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues. Through collaboration, the journalists had more impact because they discovered new stories and reached new audiences. . . .\u201d\n\nJason Alcorn, MediaShift: Knight Media Forum Focuses on Non-Profit News, Impact and Danger of Algorithms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bogen, medium.com: Artificial intelligence will force us to confront our values (Sept. 22, 2016)\n\nEditorial, Hartford Courant: The State Of Journalism Today\n\nFuture Today Institute: 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media\n\nLogan Koepke, medium.com: Pre-trial algorithms deserve a fresh look, study suggests (March 30, 2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Larson, Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., ProPublica: How Machines Learn to Be Racist (Oct. 19, 2016)\n\nSandi Miller, MIT News: Calculating the cost of tech-fueled discrimination (Dec. 13, 2017)\n\nAnna Orso, billypenn.com: Can Philly\u2019s new technology predict recidivism without being racist?

Ben, this is Herman. I know you don\u2019t know me, but I thought I\u2019d give you a call because I understand what you are going through. I know what it\u2019s like to be called a house Negro because they call me a house Negro, too, and if being like the rest of these darkies is the only way to get rid of that label, then I\u2019ll be that.\n\nOK, so Herman Cain really didn\u2019t say that, but he basically said that. Recently the Michigan Chronicle, a historically black newspaper from Ben Carson\u2019s hometown of Detroit, referred to Carson as the \u201cshame of Detroit\u201d and said that he was in competition for the \u201cHouse Negro of the Year Award.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain didn\u2019t take too kindly to that, and the former Republican presidential candidate wrote a post on his website blasting the paper for using the term.\n\nHe took it a step further on Wednesday when he wrote another post, titled, \u201cHouse Negroes Stand Up!\u201d in which he laments that he, too, has been referred to as a house Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey say it to me too, Dr. Ben Carson, because just like you, I refuse to embrace the backward thinking of today\u2019s black identity politics,\u201d Cain writes.\n\nHe goes on to say that since the Chronicle thinks Carson is a house Negro, then he, Cain, must be one, too, because that\u2019s \u201cone of the names you get called by other black people when you are a success at something, and you do not buy into \u2018black group think\u2019 or act and say what they want you to say.\u201d\n\nNo, sir, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite how that moniker is earned, but please, continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain then goes on to criticize the current movement to have Confederate monuments removed, calling it a \u201cwaste of time and distractions,\u201d and saying that the Chronicle may not have noticed the \u201csuccessful black people\u201d in \u201cprominent positions in America\u201d because they mind their business like the good black folk they are, focusing on \u201cperformance and productive opportunities\u201d rather than worrying about the past.\n\nOK.\n\nThen Cain gets all \u201cHe won\u2019t say it, but I will,\u201d like he is really about to read someone or something, and says:\n\nGentle Dr. Ben Carson is too nice to respond to that garbage article and name-calling by the Michigan Chronicle, but I\u2019m not! Let\u2019s start with the fact that he prayed hard about even accepting the HUD job. Personally, I was glad he accepted it, because he will bring \u201coutside the box\u201d ideas and thinking to HUD. Many of the old ways of doing things have left many of our urban areas unchanged for 50 years, and too many of our young people have been trapped in cycles of poverty, crime and weak educations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh? Have we witnessed any of this so-called outside-the-box thinking and ideas? What has Carson brought to the table since joining the Department of Housing and Urban Development?\n\nCain then stresses for us that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t become a world-renowned brain surgeon by being a \u2018house Negro,\u2019\u201d but I don\u2019t think anyone has made that allegation, so I think this is another instance of you keep using that phrase, but I don\u2019t think you understand what it means, Herman.\n\nHe writes that Carson could have taken any other \u201cbetter paying and less stressful\u201d job in the world, but he chose to \u201cserve his country and a president who is truly trying to create a better America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is where I have to stop you for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Carson is not making some huge sacrifice for other Americans, and most especially not for other black Americans, so let\u2019s just be real about that.\n\nSecond, Donald Trump is not trying to create a better America for anyone who looks like you, you misguided darkie. Like, for real, for real. Get your head out of your ass and wake up. You acting real Stacey Dash right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continues:\n\nThe Michigan Chronicle thanks Dr. Carson for his sacrifice and dedication by calling him a nasty insulting name. It\u2019s the usual attempt to try to discredit his patriotism and to discourage him. Knowing Dr. Carson, that old tactic ain\u2019t going to work.\n\nNo, I\u2019m pretty sure they are just calling him out for behavior that seeks to set him apart from other blacks in the country as if he is somehow better than everyone else. He is uplifting a president that is doing everything in his power to enable the constant and persistent persecution of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain goes on to say that there are plenty of black folks not drinking the \u201cname-calling brand of Kool-Aid,\u201d and we see a hint of his black roots showing themselves for a brief instant. He ruins the moment, though, by reiterating the point that those same black folks are being good and minding their business and not giving Massa no trouble like the rest of us darkies:\n\nBeing called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is just one of the insulting names I have been called as an ABC (American Black Conservative), simply because I do not subscribe to the black liberal backward-looking narrative of black identity politics. Maybe that\u2019s why I have had multiple successful careers over the last 50 years, and name-calling has not stopped or slowed me down yet! If being called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is what some of us must endure for succeeding in this nation and thinking for ourselves, then let all of the \u201chouse Negroes\u201d stand up and be counted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLOL. OK. Y\u2019all go on ahead and do that. You got it.\n\nCain ends his note by saying, \u201cWow! There are too many [house Negroes] to count, but there\u2019s Dr. Ben Carson standing tall among millions, and doing something great again.\u201d This does not sound like a compliment that anyone other than someone who is referred to as a house Negro would appreciate, but I digress.\n\nLet\u2019s let Herman Cain and Ben Carson stand together in solidarity, then.\n\nThank you, Herman Cain, for saying about yourself, multiple times in one post, what my editors won\u2019t let me say about you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["chronicle", "note", "cain", "negro", "herman", "ben", "odd", "carson", "think", "black", "say", "house", "dr", "pens"], "polarity": 0.0856729497354497, "subjectivity": 0.43780175264550264},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/on-the-duality-and-double-consciousness-of-black-panthe-1823260321", "title": "/on-the-duality-and-double-consciousness-of-black-panthe-", "text": "Through my multiple viewings of Black Panther (four so far), I become aware of certain traits of the characters, their ideals and how the actors\u2019 portrayals of them shed light on the struggles that black people and the world at large experience with tradition vs. technology, and other dichotomies.\n\nThey stand out to me because it illustrates that Black Panther\u2014i.e., T\u2019Challa himself\u2014is contending with a double consciousness, which is not unfamiliar when it comes to blackness. While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding, Killmonger chooses death later on instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut, and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future. How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that [he] had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees, Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him, and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wakanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully, she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving as two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film, and she thinks that that is enough for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the Kingsguard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrupt, so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cFuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference: Killmonger reminds me of Cersei; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cersei has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cersei literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule; he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid. What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin. Of course, this would mean that both Black Panther, life and blackness at large is layered and ultimately complex.

Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools. By the way, that neighbor who put up the Confederate flag subsequently became friendly. That is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust think about 1) how terrible this fucking story is and 2) how delusional Narcoleptic Shaft must be to think that it\u2019s inspiring or engaging or uplifting or anything other than proof that this nigga needs to move. His neighbor put up a gotdamn Confederate flag\u2014America\u2019s most unambiguous symbol of hate\u2014and Carson\u2019s response was that you beat racism by throwing American flags at it. This is not a man who needs to be holding public office. Or private office. Or even needs to be in any building that contains an office.

But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Cory Booker\u2019s representatives contacted us to say that T-Bone is a real person.\n\nDonald Trump has an imaginary friend named Jim. Ben Carson not only invented a fake friend, but then he stabbed his fake friend in an argument.\n\n\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda. And even after \u201cthe friend\u201d is exposed and is proved to be as authentic as Kim Kardashian\u2019s ass, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop the politician\u2019s advancement; on the contrary, the imagined political friend has just become the way of a real political life.\n\n\n\nThe imaginary friend as a political ploy works like this: There is no friend, but there is a point that needs to be made, and since someone around the country has experienced such hardship about said point, that experience is personified and personalized in the form of a friend\u2014a friend who doesn\u2019t exist but who suffers from real American, first world problems. This is the crux of how America has allowed the influx of imaginary friends into the political landscape and, thus, political lexicon.\n\nDuring a speech in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Trump claimed that he had a friend named Jim.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend; he\u2019s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights. He loves Paris. For years, every year, during the summer, he would go to Paris, it was automatic, with his wife and his family,\u201d Trump said, CNN notes.\n\nTrump added, \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. And I said, \u2018Jim, let me ask you a question: How\u2019s Paris doing?\u201d Trump recalled. \u201c\u2018Paris? I don\u2019t go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out that Jim doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump does this a lot, conjuring friends who don\u2019t exist. He claims that someone close to him has something to say, and that something is always in alignment with Trump\u2019s feelings. But that\u2019s because Trump is pathological. He\u2019s an ill-equipped communicator on the world stage and hardly trying to be loved. And never forget that Trump\u2019s agenda is always to push separatism, so he uses his imaginary friends for just such a reason.\n\nBut not all imaginary friends are the same; nor do they serve the same purpose. While Trump\u2019s friend Jim was used to send an anecdotal message about what happens when you open up the borders of a country, Booker and Carson have invented or embellished friends for quite a different reason: inclusion.\n\nWhen Cory Booker, now a senator from New Jersey, was mayor of Newark, N.J., he spoke of T-Bone. T-Bone was a ruthless drug lord from Jersey\u2019s Brick Towers low-income housing development who once threatened to kill Booker. T-Bone was also mentioned whenever Booker was trying to sell a story of how he understood the woes of growing up in a tough city like Newark. T-Bone became both Booker\u2019s hood pass and his mentee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how T-Bone was first introduced during a 2007 speech at the New School in New York City, according to NJ.com:\n\n\u201cI said hello to this guy and I\u2019ll never forget he leaped off the steps where he was standing and looked at me and threatened my life,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI later got to know this guy and his name was T-Bone and I\u2019m a vegetarian so that was a particularly vicious threat,\u201d Booker said to big laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker would later claim that T-Bone would come to him for legal advice.\n\nAfter being called out about T-Bone\u2019s legitimacy, Booker noted that T-Bone was real. Whether or not his name is actually T-Bone, though, has yet to be proved.\n\n\u201cHe is an archetype of so many people that are out there. He is 1,000 percent a real person,\u201d Booker said in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen NJ.com explored why people didn\u2019t call out Booker\u2019s questionable use of T-Bone, a telling answer came from Rahaman Muhammad, a city union leader who at the time was one of Booker\u2019s strongest critics.\n\n\u201cHe actually has real experiences that he can share,\u201d Muhammad told NJ.com. \u201cTo me this does not disqualify him from being a U.S. senator. These are urban stories that many of us have in this city. There may be different names, but there are many of these types of stories. Unfortunately, he made up a character for his story.\u201d\n\nNo politician, however, has done as masterly a job of deploying this narrative as former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, now secretary of housing and urban development. During his failed run for the White House, Carson weaved tales of debauchery and street toughness as if he were the black Chuck Norris. He once claimed that he stopped a stickup merely by pointing the robber toward the cash register. Most black people knew he was lying because he said that the alleged robbery attempt happened at a \u201cPopeyes organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is how CNN described Carson\u2019s tall tales:\n\nIn his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, Carson describes those acts as flowing from an uncontrollable \u201cpathological temper.\u201d The violent episodes he has detailed in his book, in public statements and in interviews, include punching a classmate in the face with his hand wrapped around a lock, leaving a bloody three-inch gash in the boy\u2019s forehead; attempting to attack his own mother with a hammer following an argument over clothes; hurling a large rock at a boy, which broke the youth\u2019s glasses and smashed his nose; and, finally, thrusting a knife at the belly of his friend with such force that the blade snapped when it luckily struck a belt buckle covered by the boy\u2019s clothes. \u201cI was trying to kill somebody,\u201d Carson said, describing the incident\u2014which he has said occurred at age 14 in ninth grade\u2014during a September forum at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. But nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson told CNN they have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is from a Yale-educated brain surgeon! The saddest part here is that Carson didn\u2019t feel that being one of the most decorated neurosurgeons was enough. He still needed a phoenixlike rise from the ashes of a hood like Baltimore to add legitimacy to his narrative.\n\nUnlike Trump, who is habitually horrible and is using everything at his disposal to destroy America, Booker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will\u2014for the crowd to show that they can move freely within both worlds.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a conundrum that all educated black men face: What do degrees mean inside the barbershop, and what does barbershop talk mean inside the hallowed halls of an Ivy League school? The funniest part of both Carson\u2019s and Booker\u2019s tales is that even in their use, they actually show how removed both men are.\n\n\u201cBlack men, almost by their very nature, have to perform. And Cory\u2014to some extent, the blackest part of him is that performance ethos,\u201d historian Clement Price told Esquire back in 2008 about Booker\u2019s friend T-Bone. The same could apply to Carson.\n\nBooker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imaginary friend in Carson\u2019s narrative and Booker\u2019s exploratory use of T-Bone helps bolster their respective street cred, and in some regards, a politician needs street cred almost as much as a rapper does. When stumping for office, a politician needs stories that show not only that he will he lead the people but also that he is of the people. That he\u2019s one of them. That he, too, has had to fend off drug dealers.\n\nAnd so, in a weird, political way, the story of T-Bone becomes a Dickensian tale about the downturn of life, and serves as the foil to Booker the protagonist and his uplifting bootstraps. T-Bone serves an anecdotal purpose in the same way that we don\u2019t know if there was ever a real Brenda in Tupac\u2019s life, but we know that \u201cshe barely had a brain\u201d and that is was \u201ca damn shame that the girl could hardly spell her name.\u201d The \u201clife story\u201d somehow becomes the life.\n\nWe don\u2019t know Brenda, and nor do we care if she exists, but we know that Brenda speaks for a larger community, and that is what attracts us to Brenda\u2019s story. We know that she has struggled; we know that she is unable to handle the rigors of raising a newborn baby while still being a child herself. We feel for her. But in the end, it\u2019s a story, a fictional tale, an imagined hardship, a lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political landscape is changing, but the anecdotal story of a friend who once did something bad is as old as America itself. It has been employed by parents and teachers who warn of the bad kid who didn\u2019t listen and, as a result, ended up dead, so is it bad that politicians have not only employed fake friends but have mentored them, taken their advice, stabbed them in a rage-filled moment?\n\nThere is a theory that says it\u2019s OK to talk to an imaginary friend, but seek help should that friend start talking back.\n\nI think we may have jumped the shark.", "keywords": ["political", "know", "booker", "tbone", "ben", "imaginary", "donald", "carson", "bookers", "real", "friends", "trump", "friend", "politicians"], "polarity": -0.04338607752400856, "subjectivity": 0.44266924167786226},

You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the majority of people don\u2019t have that defeatist attitude, but they sometimes just don\u2019t see the way, and that\u2019s where government can come in and be very helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can provide the ladder of opportunity, it can provide the mechanism that will demonstrate to them what can be done.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint, unveiled Tuesday, would cut more than $6 billion from HUD\u2019s budget. The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but Williams did, and in an interview with the Post Wednesday evening, he defended Carson and said his views are based not on politics but on what is just.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of faith, not a man of politics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson believes in what is righteous, what is good, what is fair and what is just.\u201c\n\nSo remember, kids, poverty is just a state of mind. When Sallie Mae/Navient calls you to collect on those student loans next month, tell them that you don\u2019t owe them, and your monthly payment being late is just a state of mind. Remind them that if they keep this mindset, it\u2019s going to feel as if everyone owes them money when they really don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["mindset", "post", "thinks", "parents", "mind", "dont", "ben", "children", "carson", "politics", "williams", "state", "passed", "poverty", "way"], "polarity": 0.09328165374677003, "subjectivity": 0.4390166680864355},

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

Not to be confused with Betsy DeVos, the other clueless blonde hired by the Trump administration, Van Duyne is the two-term mayor of Irving, Texas, where she was the first woman to serve in that post. She was chosen for her new position by Carson, the former brain surgeon and Jesus superfan who doesn\u2019t believe in evolution (because it is \u201cencouraged by Satan\u201d) and who once said that the Bible takes precedence over the Constitution.\n\nVan Duyne, a longtime Islamophobe, has warned people about Muslim bogeymen seeking to destroy \u201cour freedoms,\u201d plot terrorist attacks and take our bacon away. Two years ago she convinced the Irving City Council to endorse a bill by a Texas state legislator that sought to stop Shariah law\u2014even though no one was advancing Shariah law. Although the bill did not specifically mention Islam, the Dallas Morning News reported that the wording of the proposed law was almost exactly like that of a bill that had been introduced a few years earlier to stop the influence of \u201clarge groups of Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nVan Duyne was also sued by Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Irving student who was arrested after he brought a clock to school and school officials thought it was a bomb, because ... you know ... his name is Ahmed Mohamed. Van Duyne rushed to Facebook to defend the police officers who arrested the 14-year-old (she later changed the post to make it not so anti-Muslim).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot satisfied with her besmirchment of the teenager, Beth Badass sat down with Glenn Beck to further defend the police officers and teachers and to blame it on the boy and, of course, President Barack Obama:\n\nWe\u2019ve heard more from the media than the child ever released to the police when we were asking him questions.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["lowe", "colston", "talk", "going", "white", "finally", "favorite", "fans", "work", "look", "internets", "panther", "black", "video", "wakanda", "movie", "friends"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

The Knight Foundation also interviewed 45 prominent Twitter users and journalists to better understand how the media and these communities interact.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of those interviewed felt shut out of the mainstream media, and this outsider status led to these subcultures. \u201cThis sense of exclusion is one reason for the development of independent online community spaces in the first place,\u201d the report reads. Like the rest of America, many folks on Twitter do not trust the press and found some of the media\u2019s interactions with Black Twitter problematic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey findings include the following:\n\nMedia critiques often relate to how issues are framed: Media criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.\n\n\n\nMedia criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.

I've read several articles about this because I've honestly been trying to understand and what I've come up with is that there is no understanding to be had. Why an HBCU would chose to pick a member of Trump's administration so aggressively hostile towards minority communities and, frankly, actual education, is beyond me.\n\nI don't know if common sense is on vacation, and recent ads for damn near everything insinuate that to the be the case, but an actual Black institution of higher learning taking such a transparent stance towards ass kissing is embarrassing. That is the only plausible reason why anybody from this administration would be asked, especially Betsy DeVos, a woman who released an ENTIRE press release that explicitly outlined her lack of knowledge about why HBCUs even exist.\n\nLet her come to the school to sit down and be educated. Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison.

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer.

Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["designer", "beachler", "hannah", "studiosdisney", "know", "world", "marvel", "important", "production", "walks", "panther", "black", "africa", "told", "different", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy.

Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground.

The Knight Foundation also interviewed 45 prominent Twitter users and journalists to better understand how the media and these communities interact.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of those interviewed felt shut out of the mainstream media, and this outsider status led to these subcultures. \u201cThis sense of exclusion is one reason for the development of independent online community spaces in the first place,\u201d the report reads. Like the rest of America, many folks on Twitter do not trust the press and found some of the media\u2019s interactions with Black Twitter problematic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey findings include the following:\n\nMedia critiques often relate to how issues are framed: Media criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.\n\n\n\nMedia criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.

Readers roundly rejected that portrait\u2014criticizing the piece for \u201cnormalizing\u201d white nationalist and neo-Nazi beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times says that wasn\u2019t its intention.\n\n\u201cThe point of the story was not to normalize anything,\u201d the Times\u2019 Marc Lacey wrote, \u201cbut to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in American life than many of us want to think.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut this explanation raises the question: Who, exactly, is the \u201cus\u201d the paper is referring to? Black people and people of color have long been aware of the reach and prevalence of American hatred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is one typical description of Hovater from the Times:\n\nMost Americans would be disgusted and baffled by his casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate. But his tattoos are innocuous pop-culture references: a slice of cherry pie adorns one arm, a homage to the TV show Twin Peaks. He says he prefers to spread the gospel of white nationalism with satire. He is a big Seinfeld fan.\n\nThe \u201cbut\u201d implies that the latter somehow contradicts the former: that Americans will be surprised that a virulent, unrepentant racist would watch popular TV shows and eat pie. The article also lauds Hovater\u2019s Midwestern manners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the sort of construct, the sort of paragraph, the sort of article written primarily for white Americans, from a distinctly white American perspective.\n\nHovater is allowed the space to claim that he is not racist, without Fausset once acknowledging that many avowed white nationalists and white supremacists reject being called racist (rendering their views on their own racism effectively meaningless).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHovater\u2019s \u201cpolitical evolution,\u201d originating from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist,\u201d is similarly unaddressed. Fausset doesn\u2019t push back at all.\n\nNor does Fausset mention that white nationalists\u2019 foundational views\u2014that white people are under attack in the U.S., for instance\u2014were held by more than a third of respondents in a recent University of Virginia poll (the proportion is closer to 50 percent when you look at just white respondents). If Americans reject white nationalists by label, they don\u2019t necessarily reject white nationalist ideas.\n\nThese are among the New York Times piece\u2019s many failures\u2014the greatest of which is its very premise: that white supremacy is adhered to by a fringe element of American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite supremacy is foundational to the U.S., just as it is foundational to Hovater\u2019s neo-Nazi beliefs (a section about Hovater\u2019s reaction to Trayvon Martin\u2019s death and his staunch support of Trayvon\u2019s killer, George Zimmerman, is telling).\n\nIt\u2019s as American as the pie tattooed on Hovater\u2019s arm. Any serious analysis of white supremacists or white nationalists that fails to acknowledge this at the outset is doomed to fail. And this failure is evident in Fausset\u2019s tone and reporting: treating Hovater and his ilk as if they\u2014the polite racist, the mild-mannered Nazi\u2014are some novel phenomenon. The title could well have been \u201cNazis! They Are Just Like Us!\u201d (The \u201cus\u201d is, of course, white, as the \u201cus\u201d so often is with the Times.)\n\n\n\nBlack and brown people can ill afford that sort of na\u00efvet\u00e9 about mild-mannered white people. Mother Jones\u2019 Shane Bauer, cited in the Times\u2019 response to its readers, misses this point when he defends the piece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople mad about this article want to believe that Nazis are monsters we cannot relate to. White supremacists are normal ass white people and it\u2019s been that way in America since 1776. We will continue to be in trouble till we understand that,\u201d Bauer tweeted.\n\nBlack people and people of color know most intimately the monsters that lie in \u201cnormal ass white people.\u201d It\u2019s something I think about every time I look at the photos of white people, their faces contorted in anger, screaming insults and slurs at little black children going to school during the first wave of school integration. Those white people sat in church on Sundays and prepared their kids\u2019 lunches on Mondays. Ask their white neighbors, their nieces and nephews, about them, and you\u2019d likely hear stories about how kind and polite they were. How they volunteered. How they loved cherry pie and could always be relied on for a favor.\n\nWhite America has no difficulty seeing the deep-down goodness of racists\u2014white supremacy could not exist without an insistence on white virtue and white innocence.

I don\u2019t want to brag, but I\u2019ve been told that I have the voice of a dove whose tonsils have been dipped in gold and shined by a cloud. The point is that my voice is heavenly and I\u2019m sorry that you have not been able to really hear all the heavenliness (also not sure if that\u2019s a word) in it.\n\nI\u2019m also sorry for the show\u2019s host (she calls herself that), Patti LaDanielle, also known as The Root\u2019s social-content producer, Danielle Young.

Its authors are white. The executives who hire the talent are almost always white. The audiences to whom they cater are overwhelmingly white; thus, the narratives they insist on consuming are white. Even though, like all industries, white media executives recognize the power of monetizing black talent for white consumption and hire the best and the brightest, like Hill, to bring some flavor to what otherwise would be their unseasoned chicken-breast-style programming.\n\nBut that black talent can\u2019t say or do anything that hurts the bottom line or offends the white media barons who profit from it. Saying that Donald Trump\u2019s rise is a direct result of white supremacy\u2014which it is\u2014does exactly that. You see, black journalists can talk about race, but they really cannot indict racism. That is exactly what Hill\u2019s tweet did, and it was simply too much for the media overlords at ESPN to handle, and ultimately compelled them to apologize for her words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hill\u2019s part, she has yet to delete her tweets or apologize. (Good for her. She shouldn\u2019t.)\n\nMeredith Clark, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, said that ESPN\u2019s reprimand is tied to the false belief that journalism is supposed to be objective.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe industry is built on values in which whiteness is the default, that white perspectives, by default, are objective and anything that differs from that shows bias or is partial in some way,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe only way to get over that is to decentralize whiteness. Not just white men, but whiteness in general.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecentralization of white people in the media would democratize public debate in ways that would not always favor them. However, that defeats the purpose of journalism\u2019s colonial lineage, which is to prioritize the narrative of white people at the expense of everyone else. So when ESPN reprimanded Hill, it was pretty much functioning just as it should. Hill expressed views countering the media\u2019s white narrative, and the corporate machine corrected itself by essentially threatening Hill not to do it again.\n\nESPN clearly doesn\u2019t appreciate Hill\u2019s perspective. The network is better with her as one of its top personalities. As a black woman with years of experience as a beat reporter, Hill uses her well-honed intersectional analysis to flesh out complex issues on race and gender in ways that are very rare in the mainstream media landscape. Her ascent to co-hosting (with Michael Smith) her own prime-time show, The Six, was as much a victory for black journalists in general as it was for her. One of ours was making it big and making that good dollar, to boot. But her success comes with headaches\u2014namely, white people\u2019s refusal to deal with their own racism.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of the main reasons Kimberly Foster left the corporate world and founded For Harriet, a site that exclusively centers black women\u2019s perspectives. After working in corporate America for less than a year, Foster realized that she didn\u2019t have the emotional energy to contend with whiteness day in and day out to hold down a job, no matter how financially fruitful her prospects were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, she is not an entrepreneurial evangelist. Running your own media company and maintaining a payroll is not for everyone, and she admits that it can be a struggle at times. But she prefers the grind of being her own woman to climbing a corporate media ladder on which she would face nonstop attacks against her blackness on her way to the top.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that if you desire to have a career in media and have access to these huge, well-resourced platforms, you have trade your political self for your talent, your career and interests,\u201d Foster says. \u201cWhen you chose to work in corporate media, or corporate anything, that is probably what you are going to encounter. Their interests are diametrically opposed to our interests as black women. We should do what we can to lobby for change. I also think white folks are going to be white folks. Capitalism is going to be capitalism. and there is only so much lobbying and cajoling you can do within that kind of structure.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlack people make up less than 6 percent of all newsrooms, according to the American Society of News Editors\u2019 annual diversity survey (pdf); black women make up 2.49 percent of that figure. The need for black voices in journalism that take on racism and openly talk about it is more urgent than ever. But with media companies like Politico suppressing the political views of their journalists, it will be challenging to engage in the work of decolonizing the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Clark if creating our own black spaces will alleviate the stress of working corporate media, she cautioned that there are not nearly enough black media outlets with the financial resources needed to employ all of the qualified black talent on the job market. And there is also the reality that we cannot avoid white supremacy. We just have to square up and fight it.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stay in this business, you are going to find yourself, at some point and time, working for people outside of our own country,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I definitely would not call that a trade-off. I\u2019d call that a price.\u201d\n\nWe have to deal with anti-blackness, for sure. But the goal is to defeat it. And to do that, you have to destroy white supremacy. Sherri Williams, an assistant professor of race, media and communication at American University, said thatHill and other black journalists will continue to face disciplinary actions for calling out racism until that happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[The current media model] is not working, and it is definitely not working for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why [Hill] is in the position that she\u2019s in right now. These forces of hegemony and dominance, capitalism and exclusion, work across the country and lock black people out of systems across the board, whatever the profession is. Those same forces operate in media, particularly in corporate media.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "journalists", "going", "supremacy", "black", "talent", "corporate", "working", "jemele", "controls", "media", "reveals", "whiteness", "industry", "espns", "reprimand", "hill"], "polarity": 0.06573133936770297, "subjectivity": 0.3352256329529055},

Nevertheless, I am going to talk to you even though I fear you vacated your body a long time ago. I believe you sent yourself away where no one could touch you. You went crazy first and now you exist in parts. You, dear Ben, are a man who once was. But being a woman of hope, I ask: can you walk a ways and see where your heart is? I imagine it used to beat with such vigor and passion, a magic heart.\n\nI believe you are dying a slow death in the shell of your skin, because what else could bring you to say enslaved human beings who were stacked atop each other with no room to move or breathe or relieve themselves, who were starved and whipped and raped, who were ripped from their husbands and wives and from their children\u2014many of whom died during the treacherous journey, their bones their only song now at the bottom of dead seas made holy now by their gleam\u2014were immigrants? They were enslaved, Ben. They were worked, often, to death, for nothing. That\u2019s call slavery, Ben. It went on for four centuries. Ben, did you know they were in chains? Ben, what immigrants be in chains? Ben, you sound so stupid, but unfortunately, you are not merely stupid. If you were merely stupid, this would not cause us such outrage. Ben, we knew a while ago that you had become\u2026different. Conservative. Ignorant. Bigoted. You didn\u2019t look or talk like the Ben who was once ours\u2014the way the Temptations are ours, the way Barack and Michelle are ours, the way Anita Baker is ours, the way Maxine Waters is ours, the way gospel and the blues are ours. But we weren\u2019t enough for you. Our love wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and neither was self-love. Even the best Uncle Toms can be said to have been bought. Oh, Ben. I do not believe anyone bought your soul; I believe you just gave it away. And you can\u2019t stand yourself no more. I might\u2019ve felt bad enough to weep for you, except you chose this.\n\nI don\u2019t know where your hands have been, even though I know what they used to be: beautiful, brilliant hands, soft as an angel\u2019s wing, doing God\u2019s mighty work. Ben, you think you doing God\u2019s work now? You ain\u2019t. No one loves you enough to tell you because everyone in your circle is still clinging to the Ben Carson you used to be in hopes that, maybe, you could return. But I sense no one is holding their breath on that. Your new, white friends must love all that you have become: a lonesome shell that is either silent or, when he speaks, deadly.\n\nThough I believe you are gone, gone, gone, I got to at least tell you about yourself. Ben, how many Black boys and girls wanted to be doctors and surgeons because of you? But look what you did yesterday: you made racist white people\u2014and even non-racist white people\u2014get off for slavery. Yeah, you did that. I know it can\u2019t sting you just right because you deadened yourself a while back. Nevertheless. You made them believe we wanted that torture and terror. Ben, do you realize you made them believe it was okay to steal us from our first homes? That somehow, slavery was part of our striving? Ben, do you know you told them we wanted that? That we believe it was all worth it for the American Dream, which for many of us, remains a trick? Ben, your hands dirty. They ain\u2019t just dirty, though, Ben. Your hands bloody. Your hands bloody with Black blood. You put bodies on those ships yesterday. You put chains on little children. You said \u201cimmigrants\u201d as if we chose. As if that could even be possible. If you were only stupid, Ben. But no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you have chosen to be comatose because they were jealous and couldn\u2019t take your Black genius, how you understood the brain\u2014back then\u2014 the way Morrison understands language or the way Miles knew his horn. Ben, you are probably struggling with whom I mean when I say they. I mean white people. I see you shaking your head at that Ben, but they were lesser than you because they couldn\u2019t stand all the genius you were. They hated the way your mind outmaneuvered theirs. Oh, Ben. I can only imagine the landmines of micro and macro aggressions you withstood, on the regular. You were a beautiful brown tree, and they were a hurricane. A fist formed to pound you. I can only imagine the word \u201cnigger\u201d on repeat and all the countless, creative ways they called you that, day in and day out. After all, their greatest creativity is their brutality. The more creative your genius became, the more they reviled you. The more rootless you felt. You let it sink into the bone, how much they hated you. You let them wear you out. Their whiteness haunted you. Their whiteness said you ain\u2019t shit, and you believed them because you wanted their love.\n\nWhy was our love not enough? Did we not hold you up? Did we not whisper your name at Sunday dinners? Did we not pray for God to keep working through your hands? Did we not know your name like we know Dr. King\u2019s? Oh, Ben. Our love is the best love, baby. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t know that when it mattered, back when your soul was in its place, back when your heart beat on time. Your hands used to do magic work. Oh, Lord, your beautiful hands! Now they don\u2019t have no witness to speak of. They just fold in your lap. I can almost hear them: Well, Lord. We tried.\n\nBen\u2026what happened to Ben Carson?\n\nI know he gone. But do you know where you put him? Did you drown him where they drowned Emmett? Was he shot in his driveway like Medgar? Was he bombed on Christmas Eve? Did you lock him in a cell and throw away the key? Did you cut out his tongue when you took away his heart and his soul? Can you count the lives you touched? Then broke? Does Ben know that number?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t even dream anymore.\n\nBen, I have always believed Baby Suggs, holy, of Morrison\u2019s Beloved when she said, \u201cThere is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks. They don\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d Then she died. I thought that was the end-all. But you have bested even her. There ain\u2019t no bad luck in the world, I offer as revision, but a Black man who hates himself. Because that man can do no good. All he can do is make the folks who once loved him wonder if it was a phantom all that time. You made the descendants of the so-called masters feel like they were doing us a favor. Four hundred years of \u201cgood looking out.\u201d Oh, Ben. How you disappoint.\n\nYou need to know you should stop talking. I believe silence is golden right now while you go out there and find your real tongue\u2014the tongue that used to raise people from what would have been a certain death without first your tongue declaring what you were about to do, then your hands doing that magic on operating tables. Lord, how you used to shine in that operating room. How you used to shine everywhere. Don\u2019t you miss your shine? Do you remember how it felt to glow? Naw. I don\u2019t imagine you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen, I can\u2019t stand you no more or the sound of your voice. I remember who you were, though. Part of why we\u2019re out here dragging you for life is not just because you deserve it, but because your mouth is an open wound, and you hurt us with your lies yesterday. We bear the memory of what you used to mean to us. Once, I would have loved to introduce my son to you. That time has passed. I\u2019d believe you might have a chance to come back if it wasn\u2019t for your eyes. They are such lifeless, dead things.\n\nYou still got breath, from what it looks like. You have to have breath to be talking, even though you should stop. Can you use your breath as a starting point? I\u2019d hoped you might\u2019ve left your soul someplace where you can go back for it. But yesterday, you snatched pretty much all hope of that. Still and all. I write to you. Maybe something inside of you is still alive. You owe us an apology, you sad, sad shell of what used to be a man worthy of our esteem, our respect, our devotion, and our love. Now, all we got for you is shade. And scorch. Even if you uttered sorry, all we would hear is lifeless noise. So. Keep it.\n\nBut this:\n\nBen, put your eyes back in. See what you did to yourself. Amidst a sea of brown love that washed over you, back then, as a prayer, you waded out into deep water and went under. Now you work for a spoiled, hateful, incompetent soul. You salute to him. Those splinters in your feet are from the pedestal we put you on, that you shattered. Oh. How you bleed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI leave you, bewildered but not surprised.\n\nTameka Cage Conley, PhD is a literary artist who writes poetry, fiction, plays, and essays.

The Knight Foundation also interviewed 45 prominent Twitter users and journalists to better understand how the media and these communities interact.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of those interviewed felt shut out of the mainstream media, and this outsider status led to these subcultures. \u201cThis sense of exclusion is one reason for the development of independent online community spaces in the first place,\u201d the report reads. Like the rest of America, many folks on Twitter do not trust the press and found some of the media\u2019s interactions with Black Twitter problematic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKey findings include the following:\n\nMedia critiques often relate to how issues are framed: Media criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.\n\n\n\nMedia criticism is generally directed not at fake news but at what is perceived as harmful framing by the media; participants are not so much disputing the basic facts as asking why certain facts are being emphasized at the expense of others.

Samantha Black, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based designer of ready-to-wear line Sammy B., can tell you: \u201cMy phone was blowing up.\u201d\n\nWhy? While Black was asleep, dreaming up sexy leisurewear worthy of Queen Bey to wear on her private jet, Instagram caught fire. Zerina Akers, one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stylists\u2014as well as a friend of Black\u2019s\u2014had styled the star in a Sammy B. two-piece neoprene sweatsuit with a belted kimono-style Flatbush jacket ($150) and skinny Tony pop track pant ($110) in burgundy with contrasting pink athletic stripes.\n\nHearing the news, Black screamed out loud and then ran to check her website. The $260 two-piece sweatsuit had sold out within hours\u2014with 150 orders pending.\n\nBlack, who also happens to be model-gorgeous, is a two-time Project Runway contestant, competing in season 11 and All-Stars season 4. My dear friend Isaac Mizrahi, who judged her Sammy B. creations during the series, described her work to me as \u201clike Helmut Lang\u2014if his style was slightly more feminine.\u201d\n\nSince Black has her clothes handmade at a family-owned factory in Brooklyn, she had to shut down her website immediately and hustle to gather all the fabric she could find to fulfill the Beyhive\u2019s needs. What is it about that sweatsuit that\u2019s got everyone so hot?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think people loved it because for $260 you could get something Beyonc\u00e9 wore,\u201d she told me.\n\nNo sooner was she up and running again than fast-fashion knock-off artists Fashion Nova produced a copy of the Sammy B. two-piece sweatsuit, even making the unusual move of pricing the ensemble significantly higher than the designer had priced her own handmade version. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but for struggling young designers, it\u2019s tantamount to a poison kiss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter swooped in to to defend against the appropriators, migrating to Instagram to flood Fashion Nova\u2019s page, only to have their 30 comments vanish without reply. Meanwhile, sales slowed at Sammy B., which was no match for the more than 10 million Instagram followers scouring Fashion Nova for celebrity look-alike outfits that hit the market, sometimes within hours of appearing on the red carpet.\n\nSamantha Black via Instagram Samantha Black via Instagram 1 / 2\n\n\n\nHaving worked as a denim designer for top-selling contemporary brands like Aeropostale, Kenneth Cole, Jordache and Jessica Simpson, Black is no stranger to the wear and tear of the rag trade. She credits the Beyonc\u00e9 push with bringing in the funding she needed to finish the branding for her company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next move? Taking the clothes on the road to pop-up shops around the country, with the first one planned at the headquarters of BuzzFeed in New York City.\n\nEven though being knocked off was a setback, Black knows that being blessed by Beyonc\u00e9 was a giant leap forward, one she\u2019s ready to take advantage of while the crowd is still looking her way.\n\nCelebrity is the engine that propels designer business forward; to date, Issa Rae, Yara Shahidi and Fantasia have all worn Black\u2019s clothes. Now she\u2019s hoping it all adds up to being in a more financially stable place that will allow Sammy B. to soar.", "keywords": ["success", "designer", "clothes", "beyonc\u00e9", "sammy", "instagram", "b", "twopiece", "bnyfw", "samantha", "inside", "black", "sweatsuit", "fashion", "blacks", "beyline"], "polarity": 0.07888091440723022, "subjectivity": 0.49653774587985117},

Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime.

(Oh, that\u2019s Brian Scalabrine? My bad.)\n\nBlack Twitter is being unfair.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["white", "racist", "know", "im", "plan", "stuff", "gun", "right", "donald", "crime", "solved", "lives", "black", "trump", "matter", "nra", "think"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Upon their arrival, officers found the body of 31-year-old Dominic Jerome \u201cD.J.\u201d Broadus II on the ground behind the home. According to reports by the law enforcement agencies and the medical examiner, Broadus had been shot three times, at close range, in his head.\n\nTwo weeks later, it still seems that no one has any answers.\n\nWe know that Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden has turned over the case to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, citing the need for transparency in the investigation. The FDLE was called in because relatives and community activists saw a potential conflict of interest in the Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s investigation, for a very interesting reason.\n\nAt the scene, deputies found Gardner Kent Fraser. According to the police report, the 29-year-old Fraser was escorted to the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cat the request of on-scene detectives for further investigation.\u201d Fraser was not arrested and was eventually released.\n\nFraser is the son of former Jacksonville, Fla., Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Ryan T. Fraser. Ryan Fraser was fired from the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Department in 2009 for shooting an unarmed black man, Jerrick Hall. At the time, Jacksonville\u2019s sheriff said that Ryan Fraser was terminated because Hall did not pose a threat to Fraser when the deputy shot the 20-year-old Hall in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf any of this seems suspicious, it doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of this confounding case. Aside from the fact that, according to law enforcement reports, Broadus was found dead at the home of a well-connected family, there\u2019s the fact that Broadus\u2019 cellphone was never found. And there\u2019s one more interesting tidbit:\n\nThere was at least one more person at the scene.\n\nNo one in the public knows who this mysterious \u201cother person\u201d is. The Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s initial report redacts the identity of the individual. Authorities also have redacted on the police report the parts of the supplemental narratives from three other assisting officers at the scene, essentially hiding from the public the person\u2019s name and information about what they found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember that part about \u201cone more interesting tidbit\u201d from earlier? That was a red herring. Because there is one other thing you should know about this case:\n\nGardner Fraser is not just the son of \u201cfired Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\u201d Ryan T. Fraser. After Ryan Fraser lost his job in Jacksonville, he was somehow able to get another job in law enforcement. Luckily, it was in his hometown of Macclenny ...\n\nAt the Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nTo be fair, Ryan T. Fraser no longer works in Macclenny because he retired four months ago in October 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we know, according to law enforcement reports: Dominic Broadus was killed in an execution-style manner. Deputies responding to the call found at the scene of the crime the son of their former co-worker, along with another unnamed person whose identity they will not reveal. To date, no one has been arrested. In the intervening weeks, the family of the victim have been left in the dark, and the only answer they have received is, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. Just chill.\u201d\n\nSeems legit.\n\nBroadus\u2019 father, Dominic Broadus Sr., said, \u201cThe evilness of this crime has caused heartbreak and horror to me and the rest of D.J.\u2019s family, including his mother, his siblings and his son.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe father added:\n\nAt this point we know little about the investigation of D.J.\u2019s murder. Our hopes are that a competent and honest investigation will be conducted. We do know that the main suspect in the case, Gardner K. Fraser, is the son of a retired Baker County deputy sheriff. Understandably, the fact that our son was an outsider in Baker County and the suspect is a longtime, well-connected, Baker County resident, gives us concerns about the fairness of the process. As parents and citizens, we want and we demand a thorough, honest and unbiased investigation.\n\nActivists and community organizations in Florida, including the Dream Defenders, Black Lives Matter and Color of Change, are demanding transparency in the investigation. They say they believe that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department are covering up an execution to protect Gardner Fraser and the Fraser family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to The Root, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said that it does not comment on active investigations, explaining, \u201cOur top priority is to ensure the integrity of the investigation.\u201d The FDLE also said: \u201cOur role is to determine the facts of what happened, and we provide that information to prosecutors so they can make charging decisions. Once the investigation is no longer active, all information can be provided to the public.\u201d\n\nThe Broadus family have united with local and national groups from around the country to demand justice and transparency. They will hold a town hall meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 20, at 6 p.m. at the Emmanuel Church of God in Christ in Macclenny to engage the community and law enforcement in their search for answers.\n\nThey have also set up an online presence on Facebook and Twitter under \u201cJustice4DJBroadus\u201d and ask that anyone with information contact Detective Hollycross at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement at 904-360- 7100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Broadus family said, \u201cSolving this crime and punishing the evildoers will not bring DJ back to us, and although our hearts will be forever broken by this tragic event, justice for my son and our family is demanded.\u201d", "keywords": ["killing", "broadus", "mysterious", "fraser", "enforcement", "baker", "investigation", "law", "dj", "son", "county", "sheriffs", "ryan"], "polarity": 0.062419871794871774, "subjectivity": 0.4016025641025641},

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["girls", "raise", "young", "jessie", "leadership", "need", "world", "shuris", "work", "stem", "women", "tech", "black", "takes", "math", "woolleywilson"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield. If everyone has guns, bullets will be flying everywhere.

Gaines\u2019 mother and father were awarded $307,000 and $300,000, respectively, and $300,000 was awarded to the Gaines estate.

Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S.

Gaines, 23, remained inside her Randallstown apartment with tactical officers stationed in the hallway outside for six hours.\n\nRuby, who would ultimately kill Gaines and injure her young son, was posted just outside her apartment door\u2014which was cracked open.\n\nRuckle claimed that Ruby was in danger because although he was wearing tactical gear, his arms, legs and face were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ruckle, Ruby decided to fire into the apartment when he saw Gaines and her son go into the kitchen. The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["white", "racist", "know", "im", "plan", "stuff", "gun", "right", "donald", "crime", "solved", "lives", "black", "trump", "matter", "nra", "think"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

Literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhilip Owira, a South African-based journalist and producer, had this to say on Twitter about the upcoming Black Panther movie:\n\nApparently Owira, who is probably the kind of person who complained that the hats in Straight Out of Compton weren\u2019t authentic, or begins every conversation about movies with \u201cAckchyually,\u201d decided to point out that Black Panther was, in fact, NOT filmed in Africa. SO MUCH FOR AFRICAN PRIDE!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReally? Like, this is what you bring your Twitter fingers to complain about? Needless to say, he was justifiably dragged by thousands of comic fans, fanboys, black people, people who like black people and probably Black Panther director Ryan Coogler using KD\u2019s fake Twitter account. However, for thoroughness\u2019 sake, let\u2019s break this down for him and the few other stans who came to his defense.\n\n\n\nMovies are filmed in different locations all the time, because ... make believe. That\u2019s how it works. Do you know how many times Marvel has used Cleveland as a stand-in for New York City for Avengers and Spider-Man movies? A city that couldn\u2019t build a working subway if LeBron\u2019s life depended on it? As many astute film analysts on Twitter pointed out, Lord of the Rings wasn\u2019t filmed on Middle Earth, Star Wars wasn\u2019t filmed in space and I\u2019m pretty sure nobody really has tickets to Jurassic Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been meaning to write a very stern letter to Netflix about them NOT using that time machine in the main office to go back and film The Get Down properly. This kind of nonsense critique goes deeper, though. The notion that Black Panther has an obligation to show \u201cAfrican pride\u201d (whatever that is), and that the only way such pride can be demonstrated is by filming somewhere on the continent, is ridiculous.\n\nCoogler insisted on traveling throughout Africa to study before filming. The costume designer scoured the continent for ideas. Chadwick Boseman studied to find a noncolonized African accent for T\u2019Challa. Wakanda\u2019s entire vibranium economy is based on Congo\u2019s exclusive rights to the rare mineral coltan (which is in basically EVERY cellphone). Finally, they filmed half the movie in Atlanta. I mean, that\u2019s about as black as you can get for America.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get it; lots of movies have scenes filmed in Africa\u2014Age of Ultron, Judge Dredd, Mad Max: Fury Road, the original Star Wars (yeah, Luke\u2019s home planet of Tatooine was filmed in Tunisia, so basically Africans were the Resistance\u2019s only hope\u2014*mind BLOWN*)\u2014and it would\u2019ve been nice to throw some extra cash into a local economy. The fact that Black Panther wasn\u2019t filmed there, though, doesn\u2019t make it have less \u201cAfrican pride\u201d or make it less legitimate or authentic.\n\nRemember, Wakanda is about as real as Zamunda. If you look it up on Google Maps, Wakanda is an apartment complex in Southern California, so we can only take authenticity so far. If it really matters to anybody out there, I\u2019m fairly confident that there will be scenes filmed in Africa for Black Panther 2, which will be announced sometime after the opening credits of Black Panther next month.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, this is what is wrong with some kinds of black folks and the unruly megaphone that Twitter gives you. Nonsense that used to begin with your auntie on the couch and end with a conversation on the back porch suddenly gets amplified by 10. One person gets mad that Michael B. Jordan might have a nonblack girlfriend and suddenly it\u2019s a Twitter \u201cboycott\u201d of Black Panther. Somebody gets mad that Wakanda isn\u2019t filmed in one of 8 zillion locations in Africa, and suddenly Black Panther doesn\u2019t show \u201cAfrican pride.\u201d\n\nThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things. Because we get them, them some curmudgeon has to complain about them. Publicly. And ruin everyone else\u2019s fun. I\u2019m going to save my outrage for crazy pizza-store owners, racist clothing lines and Donald Trump\u2019s administration. I\u2019m not about to complain that a movie employing dozens of African-American and African actors, writers and designers\u2014using influences from all over the Diaspora\u2014isn\u2019t \u201cblack enough\u201d because the location shoots don\u2019t meet Afro 101 standards of authenticity.", "keywords": ["dude", "wasnt", "black", "twitter", "african", "movies", "wars", "im", "filmed", "star", "space", "africa", "panther", "hey", "complain"], "polarity": 0.0033271545239630337, "subjectivity": 0.48404658284977425},

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["girls", "raise", "young", "jessie", "leadership", "need", "world", "shuris", "work", "stem", "women", "tech", "black", "takes", "math", "woolleywilson"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["president", "white", "going", "notes", "victims", "teachers", "violent", "listening", "massshooting", "care", "remember", "house", "teacher", "trump", "check", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this.

Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you ever want to know where Trump or the rest of the GOP Unsullied (minus the honor, black skin and fighting abilities) stand on issues relating to gun violence or gun safety, just check with the NRA first, because that\u2019s what they do.", "keywords": ["president", "teachers", "backtracking", "carrying", "savage", "gun", "great", "guns", "trump", "cant", "objectives", "nra", "sicko", "school"], "polarity": 0.11611540111540113, "subjectivity": 0.5350782925782926},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["family", "child", "gaines", "baltimore", "mothers", "speaks", "situation", "right", "dormeus", "pain", "korryn", "theres", "hes", "lives", "mother", "rest", "wont"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["white", "twitter", "la", "tyson", "2017", "kaepernick", "land", "women", "moments", "black", "won"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["girls", "raise", "young", "jessie", "leadership", "need", "world", "shuris", "work", "stem", "women", "tech", "black", "takes", "math", "woolleywilson"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["slowspeed", "officers", "tennessee", "white", "deputies", "ordering", "shoot", "dont", "man", "unarmed", "west", "recorded", "shit", "county", "shoupe", "sheriff", "told", "chase", "dial"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

The announcements came after many users, including The Root\u2019s Monique Judge, raised hell when Twitter gave a blue check mark to Jason Kessler, a white nationalist who helped plan the pro-Confederacy march in August in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\n\nWhile Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and his workers ruminated on the company\u2019s account-verification policies, I decided it was a good time for black people to pause and think about our relationship with Twitter and other social media and technology companies. We voluntarily \u201ccontribute\u201d our creative insights, dollars and labor to the success of these companies by buying devices and apps, uploading memes, ideas and language that trend widely. Yet in terms of the vast wealth these companies hold, disburse to employees and generate for shareholders, we get little in return.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of the recent moment when top lawyers for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, along with Twitter and Facebook, were summoned to Capitol Hill to testify before Senate and House committees looking into the company\u2019s role in disseminating toxic content and ads during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nI shared the congressional investigators\u2019 agita\u2014and the pointed through line of their questioning: How did we get to the point where tech seems to be drowning American democracy? How could the educated, experienced \u201ctechnologists\u201d who built and run these companies have missed the Russians\u2019 insidious gaming of their platforms?\n\nI think there\u2019s one big reason among several that led to the companies\u2019 obliviousness: The tech industry is nearly wholly centered in an exclusionary bubble of white men who finance, develop and market the platforms and applications. The same biases that led to the development of social media startups built on algorithms that enable racial profiling (like NextDoor), or that inform court decisions resulting in blacks and Latinos receiving unduly harsh sentences (like COMPAS), played a role in the Russians\u2019 stealthy misinformation campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-black messaging was the secret sauce of many of the pro-Trump, nationalist memes and messages that flooded through the popular social media channels during the 2016 election cycle. Yet somehow, the gatekeepers at Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t seem to notice the methodical manipulation of racial animus that already exists in America\u2014specifically, some white Americans\u2019 negative opinions of blacks.\n\nThe leaders and staffs of Twitter, Facebook and other popular social media platforms missed the Russians\u2019 exploitation of the black-white divide, an obliviousness that has precedent: Black women who use Twitter had long alerted the platform\u2019s officials to the abusive conduct of other users, up to and including death threats. The hashtag #YourSlipIsShowing catalogs such experiences from black women dating back several years and is readily available ... at least to those interested in learning about and addressing these kinds of user experiences.\n\nBut clearly, the tech-company leaders were not inclined to pay attention to this area of user complaints, a strong indication that they also probably weren\u2019t interested in the views of the few black and Latinx workers at their companies, either. Just look at what happened to Leslie Miley, a black former engineer at Twitter. Miley revealed in a recent interview that he had flagged tons of dubious accounts in 2015, telling his bosses that he believed they were from Ukraine or Russia and that they appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley was told by his bosses at Twitter to \u201cstay in his lane,\u201d a response that Miley says he took as a sign that the company leadership preferred to err on the side of \u201cgrowth numbers\u201d rather than on any potential harm to audiences that the bots might pose.\n\nMeanwhile, black users of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Google products infuse them with a deep coolness factor that resonates around the world. Our intellectual property and creativity is the lifeboat that floats these companies to revenue solvency, yet few of us share in the enormous economic wealth generated by these companies, not even after dozens of news stories, industry conferences and activists\u2019 complaints forced the companies to pledge to improve hiring and retention.\n\n\n\nThe history of black-white tension in America was a major flashpoint manipulated by the GOP during the presidential campaign (not for the first time), and the Russia-controlled bots capitalized on whites\u2019 fears of and disdain for black Americans. This exploitation has been documented by federal investigators, as well as media, including Terrell J. Starr here at The Root and at other news outlets.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the owners, leaders and staffs at the tech companies did not seem to notice or care about the implications of the sneaky manipulation while it happened in real time. The incredible whiteness of their leaderships and staffs is akin to, but far worse than, that of the news industry (which is significant). And the companies\u2019 whiteness is a big reason they missed the infiltration of these divisive messages and tribal calls to action during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nBlack Americans know when something smells rotten, including the kinds of scams and shady b.s. that can unfold at one\u2019s job. And, as usual, blacks and other marginalized communities have solutions. We have the brainpower, problem-solving acumen and moral fortitude to right the ship of state.\n\nThe question is whether our concerns and advice will be heeded and whether we can achieve full access to the genuine levers of power in the United States, including access to quality education, health care, voting and, most importantly in the context of the innovation ecosystem, investment capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you regularly shout out Chance the Rapper or Ava via the \u2019gram, or post your hair-braiding tutorials on YouTube or Amazon.com commercial verticals and cash the resulting PayPal deposits accordingly, you are well within your rights to hold these companies accountable and question the political and economic structures that gave these companies ready access to us, their most valuable cultural assets. Our fixating on the blue check mark of verification should be the least of it.\n\n\n\nWhile there certainly are rough seas and shimmering mirages all around, I do see promise and opportunity in the amazing tech discoveries and innovations that enter the marketplace daily. I also see a future in which blacks and other historically marginalized creators and entrepreneurs more powerfully leverage their advantages in service of owning these technologies.\n\n\n\nRight now we\u2019re swimming in amazing discoveries, yet drowning in age-old belief systems and tribalism that effectively cancel out far-ranging benefits of the powerful machines that increasingly shape our experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is up to us see to it that tech is built and used to positively tell our stories, support our causes and policies, and shape our destinies.", "keywords": ["white", "facebook", "twitter", "companies", "black", "solution", "users", "including", "media", "social", "tech", "whiteness", "techs", "problem"], "polarity": 0.09615543186971759, "subjectivity": 0.40157366443080733},

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Ilessthan3photography/\" target=\"_blank\"> ilessthan3photography\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of. She\u2014and others like her\u2014deserve more options.\n\n", "keywords": ["nice", "wasnt", "characters", "options", "cosplay", "youre", "thats", "28daysofblackcosplay", "convention", "black", "nerd", "character"], "polarity": 0.11967108055343345, "subjectivity": 0.4806445760122231},

While many outlets mistakenly reported the numbers as earnings, earned media value is actually the estimated value of publicity a brand gains through digital or social media.\n\nBrands pay for advertising every single day. That advertising can cost a lot of money. EMV shows us how much a company gets and what it would have cost had the company actually paid for the advertising. When a brand\u2019s products get talked about, shared, tweeted and written about in magazines, on social media, that is basically free advertising for them.\n\nEMV measures how much that advertising would have cost if the brand had paid for it. It is not an indication of the brand\u2019s actual earnings. However, earned media value can and does turn into real revenue for a company. It is a measurement of social capital.\n\nThink of it the way you think of tweet impressions. Press the Twitter Analytics button on any one of your tweets. The impressions number is how many eyeballs saw your tweet. That plays into EMV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow think of tweet engagement as sales. Someone seeing your tweet is an impression. That\u2019s eyeballs on a product. Someone engaging with your tweet? That\u2019s a sale. This is how EMV works.\n\nIn other words, if eyeballs on the tweet, post, etc., lead to people clicking and going through to buy a product, that is EMV.\n\nIn the case of Fenty Beauty, when the company launched on Sept. 8, the internet went wild. Women tweeted, took Instagram pictures and made Facebook posts showing their hauls and their face-beats using the highly coveted products. That is advertising gold. Fenty didn\u2019t have to do anything but be great; social media fans did all the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only companies to do better than Fenty Beauty during the month of September were Anastasia Beverly Hills and legacy cosmetics brand MAC.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music ....

I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression.

Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain. The investigation revealed no evidence to refute Officer Carelli\u2019s testimony that he shot Mr. Chamberlain in response to his belief that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously physically injured by Mr. Chamberlain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the Justice Department\u2019s reason for closing the case. Because it is OK to shoot someone as long as\u2014despite all the evidence to the contrary\u2014you believe that he or she poses a danger, you can murder that person in cold blood.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music ....

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Family attorney Billy Murphy did not know the cause of death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was a heck of a guy,\u201d Murphy told the Sun.\n\nShipley was recognized for his unwavering calm after his stepson died as a result of injuries that he sustained while in police custody. Gray\u2019s death sparked nationwide protests as well as riots in the city.\n\n\u201cLet us have peace in the pursuit of justice,\u201d Shipley insisted on May 1, 2015, just hours after Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn J.

If you are not coming in peace, please don\u2019t come at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this city needs to get back to work.

It was fairly windy, so maybe a gust had set off the car alarm, though no sound was coming from the car.\n\nThe car was parked in the driveway of the home, the outdoor Christmas lights were on and I could see that a light on the top floor was on, so I assumed that somebody was home. I thought to myself, \u201cI should hop out of the car and go ring their doorbell and let them know that their car lights are on.\u201d Lord knows, I\u2019d hate to wake up in the morning\u2014it was about 8 p.m. when I saw the car\u2014and find out my car battery was dead because the alarm was going off all night.\n\nI almost pulled up to the house right then, but I decided to drop off my daughter first. Should something go awry, I do not want my daughter there.\n\nShould something go awry.\n\nThat\u2019s literally the first thought that popped into my head. I wanted to let this family know that their car alarm was going off and that they might want to go see about it, and I was worried about what could go wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI dropped off my daughter at her mother\u2019s home, which is farther into the subdivision, so I\u2019d pass the house on my way back out. I told myself that if the alarm was still going off when I drove by again\u2014likely\u2014that I\u2019d get out and go ring their doorbell and let them know. It seemed like such a simple and neighborly thing to do. And here was where all of the true overthinking began.\n\nI pulled up to the side of the house and started to plan how I was going to go about telling them. For one, I had on all black, save for my maroon down jacket, with a black hoodie and black skullcap. It was about 15 degrees outside, so I wasn\u2019t taking any of that off and risking getting myself sick in order to let them know their car lights were blinking.\n\nThen I thought to myself, \u201cIf I go up to this door and ring the doorbell and wait, chances are they\u2019ll turn the light on so they\u2019ll be able to see me, but I\u2019m dressed as I am, and because of the positioning of the garage, they won\u2019t actually be able to see their car from their front door, so they could be suspicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll just go ring the doorbell, walk back to my car quickly hoping that I beat them answering the door, maybe get into my car or stand there, and when they open the door, yell an entire concession speech about how I wanted to let them know about their car but didn\u2019t want to frighten them as a random stranger dressed in all black at their door at 8 p.m. on a really dark street\u201d\u2014seriously, this street needs streetlights in the worst way\u2014\u201cbut didn\u2019t want them to wake up to a car with a dead battery.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want them to think about having to step outside the door with me there and wondering if I was going to try to force myself into their home, so I walked away from the door.\n\nI was really thinking about saying all of that. Why?\n\nI did not want to end up shot or having the police called on me. Do I know if they had a gun? Or would have answered the door with one? No, I don\u2019t. But do I know that they wouldn\u2019t have? Nope. They didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know them and it was dark outside and late enough to wonder who would be stopping by the house unannounced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI literally had all of these thoughts as I sat there and tried to strategize how to do them a solid and put myself in the least amount of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAnd you know what I did? I drove off. I felt bad for driving off. But I also felt like I had to think too hard on how best to make them feel comfortable as I tried to help them out, and how my trying to be nice required me to consider so many factors about myself and how I would present at the door.\n\nIt\u2019s ENTIRELY possible that I totally overthought the whole thing. Maybe I watch too much television or read too much\u2014a police officer told me that once when he pulled me over and I very slowly and deliberately told him what I was doing as I grabbed my wallet. I was pissed that he\u2019d mocked me when I was trying to make sure I made it home safely and he didn\u2019t shoot anybody that night because he feared for his life over a taillight in front of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Union Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recognize there was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about walking up to somebody\u2019s door, and if it had been summer and more well-lit outside, I would have without a second thought. But I\u2019ve read too many stories of trivial encounters gone all the way wrong. And I could see all the ways it could have happened in the few minutes I sat there pondering how I\u2019d do this. And it wasn\u2019t lost on me that, ultimately, I had to strategize a good deed so that this one did not go punished.\n\nUnder different circumstances, I\u2019d absolutely walk up to a door and alert somebody. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve done it in my own neighborhood\u2014one where I\u2019d think people would be more hyperaware of people coming to their door.\n\nChances are, even last night, nothing would have happened to me. I\u2019d have let them know, they\u2019d have checked out their car, thanked me and turned off the alarm, and we\u2019d all have gone about our lives. But I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who lived there or what they\u2019ve gone through in life. Or what they\u2019ve seen. Or if it was a cop who is always on high alert, or whatever.

There\u2019s something about that combination of physicality, virility and utter lack of perspective can make them seem cold and unfeeling. Mean girls, bully boys and all permutations in between hide their former cuteness and potential behind a veneer clouded by social media and raging, swirling, gurgling hormones. But, alas I have two teenaged siblings. A brother and, yes, a sister.\n\nLooking back on my formative years, I remember teenage girls existing. Objects of affection. Disinterested Classmates. Serial Whisperers. But I was not yet savvy enough to notice all the subtleties of their actions. The feints, the misdirections, the verbal inside out hesitation dribbles, the blatant trolling toward concerned family members.\n\nA few friends who are now years removed from that base condition of adolescence warned me of the power that potential embarrassment holds over young ladies of a certain age, so I\u2019ll leave my own sister out of this (mostly), but I needed help with, um, helping her. And allowing me to know her. So I turned to Black Girls CODE. If you aren\u2019t hip, Black Girls CODE is an organization that is devoted to showing the world that black girls can code, preparing them to occupy some of the 1.4 million tech jobs in the market, and helping me find out what my kid sister won\u2019t take her buds out of her ear. (Oh, wait that\u2019s embarrassing isn\u2019t it, I\u2019ll stop)\n\nBGC\u2019s latest hackathon in NYC allowed me get a close up look at how black girl magic, rather black girl scientific method, empowers young girls who may feel ignored by their school system or alienated in their communities. Girls need mentors, communities need support and it's undoubtedly beneficial when youth can look to someone like them to bolster their inner resolve.\n\nTiana Kara, who handles strategic partnerships at BGC, gave me a little insight into how BGC is working to help girls of color triumph in the current social and professional landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt can empower her where she needs to be empowered. Girls that attend our workshop that go on to work with other boys don\u2019t shy off. Statistically, girls in groups with boys become shy and don\u2019t speak up. Girls who attend our camps become leaders. She\u2019ll definitely learn to speak up for herself.\u201d\n\nManagement of self image seems to be exponentially more important for teenagers. Flower crowns may be seemingly harmless but the proliferation of screen time has warped the value of self-esteem. Your \u201cself\u201d is your profile. Your image is you. A new school can\u2019t recreate you. Better grades can\u2019t change you. You is a record of events rather than a person. If I\u2019m allowed to use my degree for a moment, one of the key components of Laura Mulvey\u2019s Visual Pleasure and the Narrative Cinema is that identity is formed in relation to who you see on the screen. In films, women\u2019s bodies are often chopped into sexualized sections while protagonists and their agency are usually coded male. While Mulvey was pointing out how this dynamic effects women on the big screen the 70s, real time personalized negative commentary via Facebook or Snapchat has been proven to be a more insidious mental worm than the influence of mass media.\n\nEmpowerment is increasingly important when self esteem is under assault and our government appears to be exercising their open hostility toward vulnerable communities. BGC arms our girls with technical skills that can demystify the bevy of apps that dominate their young lives, the networking support to present them with opportunities they may have never thought possible, and the community access that gives parents, volunteers, and overly concerned siblings an accessible outlet to turn their concern into action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillennials get a harsh rap for their (or our) employment status, but they (or we) came into being at an interesting moment in time. Just in time for the internet to become a truly ubiquitous thing, but not in time for us to be groomed on how to understand and create careers from it. BGC is preparing girls to work in the new world and preventing them for being source material for season two of 13 Reasons Why. Tiana blessed me with a critical gem during our convo,\n\n\u201cCoding doesn\u2019t just help with tech, it also helps you learn how to build. Step outside of the computer and focus on how something works. How is this built?\u201d\n\nThe communities, businesses, and families of the future are waiting to be built and it\u2019s critical that the our young builders understand that process. It\u2019s just a cherry on top of the sundae that the architects in charge smell like freshly pressed coconut oil and rock Hillman college sweaters. It doesn\u2019t matter if your fluency in CSS, Javascript and Ruby on Rails is akin to badly prepared American tourists on the hip flight to Havana, the women of BGC speak coding languages and common american teenage angst.

Even if STEM isn\u2019t her primary interest, she\u2019ll learn how to build from women who\u2019ve built themselves and their communities, and a boy free sabbatical wouldn\u2019t hurt either.

Thanks, Wicked City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, tamer programs hit the airwaves, and in high school, I was able to blow my retail-job money on Dragon Ball Z VHS tapes. It was chalked up as a weird but generally harmless hobby, and I became that quirky black girl who wrote fan fiction in Gundam Wing notebooks and schooled dudes in the ways of \u201cMarvel vs. Capcom 2\u201d\u2014don\u2019t @ me about my super fighting robot, Mega Man.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve heard this story before: the tale of the lone black geek who gets ostracized by the black community for being too much Steve Urkel and not enough Stefan Urquelle.

Nerd-dom was just one aspect of my life\u2014a large one, but still, just one.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop.

He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber\u2019s funeral expenses, go here.", "keywords": ["killing", "reels", "weber", "community", "young", "shot", "neighborhood", "death", "los", "anthony", "black", "aj", "angeles", "16yearold"], "polarity": -0.0647421536796537, "subjectivity": 0.4544421296296296},

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children.

Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground.

She sustained major brain damage due to lack of oxygen and had been in a coma ever since.\n\nIt was her second heart attack.\n\nBack in August of this year, Erica gave birth to her second child, a son, whom she named Eric after her father. It was after baby Eric\u2019s birth that the activist suffered her first heart attack. It was then that doctors discovered that she had an enlarged heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was a warrior, she was a fighter and we didn\u2019t pull the plug on her,\u201d Esaw Snipes-Garner, Erica\u2019s mother, said, according to the New York Daily News. \u201cShe left on her own terms.\u201d\n\nErica Garner was indeed a force to be reckoned with, occupying space and speaking out loudly against police brutality ever since her father\u2019s July 2014 death. She was unafraid, unabashed and unapologetic about what it was she was fighting for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMere months after her father\u2019s death, Erica staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d at the very same location in Staten Island where he had the confrontation with police that led to his death, even as he pleaded with New York City police officers, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\n\n\nEric Garner\u2019s last words became the rallying cry for a movement as protests swept the entire nation. His death was followed weeks later by Michael Brown\u2019s killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., the catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn July 2016, two years after her father\u2019s death, Erica took on President Barack Obama and ABC News during a presidential town hall that the network was hosting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe activist got up and left the taping of the event after she said she had been \u201crailroaded\u201d by the network and denied the opportunity to ask the president a question, an opportunity that she said she had been promised.\n\nErica said that she had an agreement that she would be able to ask Obama about the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into her father\u2019s death, only to be blindsided.\n\nThe mother of two was particularly frustrated as she cleared time to go to Washington, D.C., even as she was planning an event for the then-two-year anniversary of her father\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo months after taking that stand, she called out New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio after the mayor claimed that he was barred from releasing the records of her father\u2019s killer, Daniel Pantaleo, citing an archaic law that has been ignored for the past 30 years as the reason he could not do so.\n\n\u201cJust cause you love Black pussy don\u2019t mean you love Black lives\u2026 cc @BilldeBlasio,\u201d Garner wrote on Twitter, pointing out that de Blasio, a white man, is married to a black woman and raising a black son but still couldn\u2019t give a damn about state-sanctioned killings.\n\n\u201cThe thing that kills me is that De Blasio is raising a Black man ... This is the example ... My dad lays down and rolls over for white supremacy,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, she was an outspoken supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, with Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign releasing a stirring video, featuring Erica somberly speaking about being a mother and activist.\n\nHer light, her will to fight and outspokenness and her truth shone brightly in the face of oppression and sometimes outright dismissal. In her passing, this world has lost more than could possibly be recognized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur thoughts go out to her entire family at this incredibly difficult time.\n\nRest in power, Erica.", "keywords": ["erica", "york", "daughter", "27", "victim", "death", "left", "eric", "heart", "policebrutality", "garner", "black", "mother", "fathers", "dead", "presidential"], "polarity": 0.02224283652855082, "subjectivity": 0.4134096062667491},

Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

Other evidence, including shell casings, witness statements and forensic analysis, indicated that Rialmo was apparently farther away from LeGrier when he fired than he initially said he was.\n\nAccording to the Tribune, LeGrier fell in the vestibule of the apartment building. Rialmo said that he fired from the building\u2019s front porch. However, it has since been determined that it was more likely that Rialmo fired from between the bottom of the porch and the sidewalk outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the board concluded, would have had no reason to believe that he was in danger of death or serious injury.\n\nIt was not immediately made public what recommendations for punishment disciplinary authorities made, but the Tribune notes that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability usually recommends termination for officers involved in unjustified shootings. After that, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will have three months to decide what form of discipline, if any, he will take.\n\nRialmo\u2019s attorney, of course, is paid to argue for his client, and he claimed that the agency\u2019s ruling cast the evidence in a misleading light, pointing out that LeGrier appeared to be suffering from a mental health crisis during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anybody not to feel that their life was in danger in such a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political decision, not one based on the evidence. ...

And I know he didn\u2019t. I knew he was just as much a victim as she was. He was innocent, too,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is worth noting that the Cook County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute Rialmo in February, claiming that there was insufficient evidence (evidence that COPA managed to get its hands on, but I digress) that Rialmo was not acting in self-defense.\n\nEarlier this month, just to add insult to injury, attorneys for the city of Chicago announced that they were toying with the idea of suing LeGrier\u2019s family, claiming that he\u2014a teen suffering through a mental health crisis\u2014was to blame for Jones\u2019 death.\n\nRialmo himself filed a lawsuit against LeGrier\u2019s estate on the grounds of emotional distress and assault, claiming that the teen forced Rialmo to kill him. Rialmo also sued the city of Chicago, saying that he was not properly trained to handle tense encounters with those with mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.", "keywords": ["officers", "board", "quintonio", "finds", "fatal", "shooting", "rialmo", "tribune", "officer", "mental", "office", "jones", "legrier", "evidence", "oversight", "chicago", "unjustified", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04088541666666666, "subjectivity": 0.33385416666666656},

Eastmead and some dozen other officers and supervisors, including those who witnessed the encounter, have been named as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking at least $75,000 in damages.\n\nMcNeil, for her part, was charged with domestic violence and resisting a police officer. She pleaded no contest to domestic violence, while officials dropped the resisting arrest charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit claims that she was charged with a felony count of resisting a police officer only to justify the officer\u2019s brutal use of force and to pressure her into taking a plea bargain.\n\nRadner said that McNeil has no recollection of what happened at the jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Detroit Free Press and the Daily Reporter.", "keywords": ["officers", "jail", "claims", "resisting", "wall", "officer", "thuglike", "arrest", "mcneil", "eastmead", "michigan", "sues", "brutal", "video", "woman", "lawsuit", "conduct"], "polarity": -0.10087719298245612, "subjectivity": 0.4916666666666667},

Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition.
