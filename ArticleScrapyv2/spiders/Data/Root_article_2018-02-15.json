Gucci demanded that the retailer immediately stop selling any garments or accessories that bore Gucci\u2019s federally trademarked green-red-and-green or blue-red-and-blue striping patterns. Gucci has had trademark registrations on those striping patterns going back as far as 1988.\n\nForever 21 responded in June 2017 by filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, arguing:\n\nMany clothing and accessory items adorned with decorative stripes colored blue-red-blue or green-red-green are sold by countless third parties. ... The colors red, blue, and green, and stripe designs, are among the most favorite, popular and widely used colors and design features on clothing.\n\nThe company contended:\n\nGucci should not be allowed to claim that Gucci, alone, has a monopoly on all blue-red-blue and green-red-green striped clothing and accessory items\u201d and stated \u201cConsumers are not likely to be confused into believing the Striped Products sold in Forever 21\u2019s stores by Forever 21 are manufactured by, sponsored by, authorized by, or otherwise associated or affiliated with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForever 21 asked the court to cancel the at least nine different trademark registrations Gucci has over the patterns, terminate any pending applications for trademarks on the patterns and quash any potential trademark-infringement claims Gucci has against Forever 21.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Fernando M. Olguin sided with Forever 21, stating, \u201cForever 21\u2019s trademark cancellation non-infringement claims are viable\u201d and should be decided at trial.\n\nThe judge also rejected Gucci\u2019s request to dismiss Forever 21\u2019s trademark-cancellation claim, arguing that when consumers see those striping patterns, they do not automatically associate then with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaura Chapman, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin who is representing Forever 21 in the case, said in a statement to TFL Tuesday, \u201cForever 21 feels very strongly that Gucci improperly sought trademark registrations for these popular designs in a wrongful effort to monopolize them, and that these designs should be freely available for use by anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added that the case highlights more than 100 examples of other brands using that type of striping pattern, including Louis Vuitton, Versace, Valentino, St. John, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Gap and J. Crew, among many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cForever 21 believes Gucci\u2019s trademark registrations and applications should be cancelled by the court and looks forward to continuing to litigate this case to a fair and just result,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nA spokesman for Gucci said, \u201cIn an effort to distract from its own blatant infringements, Forever 21 is attempting to attack some of Gucci\u2019s most famous and iconic trademarks. This will not deter Gucci from pursuing its own claims against Forever 21 as part of its ongoing commitment to the vigorous protection of its valuable intellectual property rights and distinctive brand identity.\u201d\n\nGucci is an iconic brand with many years in the game, and putting aside what the judge in the case has said, I think we can all agree that Gucci\u2019s striping pattern is recognizable as being theirs and have been for many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I would agree that someone going into Forever 21 knows good and damn well that they aren\u2019t buying anything Gucci in a store with prices that low, and there would be no confusion about whether or not Gucci made the garments and accessories.\n\nThere is, however, something to be said for brand recognition. Even customers shopping in Forever 21 would agree that those stripes look like Gucci\u2019s; they just also know they aren\u2019t buying Gucci in Forever 21.", "keywords": ["forever", "red", "green", "21", "trademark", "stripes", "designs", "guccis", "registrations", "case", "patterns", "gucci", "striping"], "polarity": 0.20939393939393935, "subjectivity": 0.5103030303030303},

Surprise!\n\nHonestly, most research that surfaces about the harmful effects of racism leaves the majority of us unimpressed and unsurprised. It\u2019s been proved that experiencing racism is tied to stress, heart disease, pregnancy complications and probably everything else you can think of that can lead to death or a lower quality of life.\n\nThis week, researchers at King\u2019s College London released a study that links adolescent smoking habits to racial discrimination. They surveyed more than 6,500 young people from London schools at several points between ages 11 and 23 and found that those who experienced racism were up to 80 percent more likely to pick up their first cigarette by their 16th birthday. According to the study, students who reported positive relationships with family or a tie to religion were less likely to pick up smoking habits despite exposure to racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cAn important point here is that racism affects both physical and mental health outcomes,\u201d said professor Seeromani Harding, principal investigator of the study. \u201cAddressing racism is an important public health priority for young people.\u201d Researchers do note that there isn\u2019t enough data to show causation between racism and teen smoking, but the evidence does mirror recent trends in adolescent behavior.\n\n\n\nIf addressing racism as a public health priority sounds like common sense, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re on the receiving end of racism\u2014but for folks on the other side, common sense ain\u2019t so common.\n\n", "keywords": ["smokers", "common", "sense", "watch", "researchers", "racial", "smoking", "turning", "racism", "health", "teens", "public", "study", "young"], "polarity": 0.061946386946386954, "subjectivity": 0.4582042957042957},

The measure would strike the death penalty from being considered as a sentencing option for aggravated murder. If the bill passes, the harshest sentence in the state would instead be life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Statehouse, which has a two-person Democratic majority.\n\nThanks to Gov. Jay Inslee, there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington since 2014.\n\nLawmakers cited the cost of maintaining the death penalty and incidences of wrongful convictions as reasons to abolish capital punishment. According to the Times, one Seattle University study from 2015 found that death-penalty cases in Washington \u201ccost $1 million more than similar cases where capital punishment [was] not sought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the co-sponsors of the bill, state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, said the vote was a reflection of the public\u2019s evolution on capital punishment.\n\n\u201cYou cannot read a front-page story about DNA mistakes that has someone in jail for 35 years and not be jolted to the core,\u201d Carlyle said, according to the Times. \u201cThat has transformed the public\u2019s view of this issue.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, as in other parts of the country, capital punishment disproportionately affects black defendants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne 2015 study found that jurors in Washington state were three times more likely to recommend a death sentence for a black defendant than a white one\u2014despite the fact that prosecutors were slightly more likely to seek the death penalty against white defendants. This unequal application of the punishment was among the reasons Gov. Inslee instilled the moratorium.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nIn a written statement issued after the vote, Inslee said that when he enacted the moratorium, \u201cI hoped it would create space for a discussion about the unequal application of this law, the enormous costs of seeking this punishment and the uncertainty of closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d \u201cI hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the bill passes in the Statehouse, Washington will join 19 other states and the District of Columbia in ridding themselves of the death penalty.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn.

That is a clear indication that Flynn might be negotiating a plea deal that could include him testifying against the president or senior White House officials, according to the report.\n\nThose negotiations would include prosecutors telling Flynn, off the record, of course, the evidence they have against him. They would then give him the opportunity to disclose what information or evidence he has that could implicate others in the case, up to and including the president himself.\n\nSources told ABC News that prior to last week\u2019s break, Flynn\u2019s legal counsel and Trump\u2019s legal team had engaged in privileged discussions for months.\n\nOne member of the Trump legal team, Jay Sekulow, told ABC News last week that the break was \u201cnot entirely unexpected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about Gen.

Flynn, who worked as a part of Flynn Intel Group.

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["president", "russia", "trump", "making", "weak", "trumps", "republican", "gop", "obama", "hawks", "ukraine", "fake", "russian", "russias", "look"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

It was funded by the Progress for USA Political Action Committee and has since moved to Mother Jones, where it now functions as a new project to report on the Trump-Russia ties and foreign influence in U.S. politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the inquiries about Putin-Trump, WikiLeaks continued to solicit Trump Jr.\u2019s cooperation until at least July 2017 with requests that included asking for Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, urging the Trump campaign on Election Day to reject the results of the election as rigged, and requesting that the then president-elect tell Australia to appoint Assange ambassador to the United States.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., told The Atlantic: \u201cOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests. Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to The Atlantic\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday evening, Assange publicly tweeted that he could not confirm the DMs that The Atlantic reports to have because WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t keep those records, and The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cpresentation is edited.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little more than an hour later, Trump Jr. tweeted copies of the DMs reported in The Atlantic\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for the frosting on this cake of disbelief, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau found this juicy little gem:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Trump Jr. colluded, and his daddy (it appears) knew it.\n\nMessy, messy, messy.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the story. Even after Trump won the election, WikiLeaks continued to reach out to Junior to get him to cooperate with various things, including asking him to let them leak copies of emails between himself and publicist Rob Goldstone, who had set up a meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya\u2014who has connections to Russia\u2019s powerful prosecutor general.

Recent reports found that Moscow tried to hack election machines before Election Day and sent phishing emails to elected officials to cause more chaos. The nation\u2019s politics have devolved in an ever-downward spiral since. An independent investigation probing the Trump campaign\u2019s complicity in the madness is ongoing, though it may not calm the calamity his short presidency has caused\u2014even if it ultimately forces Trump out of office.\n\nYes, Russia did meddle in last year\u2019s presidential election, but people have to be gullible and racist enough to be exploited by Moscow\u2019s deployment of right-wing fake news appearing in their social media timelines. While fake news may have swayed voters\u2019 opinions, Russia didn\u2019t vote Trump into office.\n\nWhite people did that.\n\n\n\nDuring Russia-investigation hearings on the Hill in March, former counterintelligence experts testified that ethnic division is a hallmark of Russia\u2019s fake-news strategy. Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and cybersecurity expert, said (pdf), \u201cRussia targets specific audiences inside electorates amenable to their messages and resulting influence\u2014in particular \u2018alt-right\u2019 audiences incensed over immigration, refugees and economic hardship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer intelligence officials and scholars who study the intersection of race and electoral politics told The Root that it is not surprising that much of the fake news that targeted the United States was rooted in racist sentiments.\n\n\u201cThis country was founded on white supremacy, predicated entirely on black racism,\u201d said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University. \u201cSo if you have everybody paying attention to their anti-black racism, you can feed them any stories you want. It can be about Negroes coming to get you, but then it easily transfers to Muslims\u2014especially since 9/11\u2014and any brown skin people.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe impact of these fake-news attacks is still being studied, but what is clear is that many white Trump supporters are actually OK with the possibility that Kremlin interference won the White House for Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what it took,\u201d David Gubert, a Trump supporter, told the New York Times in January. \u201cI\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nIn The Root\u2019s new series, the Black Guide to Russia, each story will analyze the latest developments of the Russia investigation with a fresh, black perspective. While special counsel Robert Mueller investigates Trump, The Root will investigate the social conditions that made the American populace so vulnerable to being played.\n\nEven if it is confirmed that Trump colluded with Moscow, that likely will not explain why, for example, 53 percent of white women voted for him. That is not a Russia problem. It\u2019s a domestic issue independent of the Kremlin that requires as deep an analysis of white America\u2019s racism as does the hybrid warfare that Russia waged to exploit it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Vital Was Fake News in the 2016 Election?\n\nPutin has long rejected claims that the Kremlin had anything to do with meddling in last year\u2019s elections. But during a press conference in June, he joked that Russian \u201cpatriots\u201d may have been behind the Democratic National Committee hack, but were never ordered by Moscow to do so. The FBI, however, believes that Russia deployed fake-news conspiracy stories about Hillary Clinton on Election Day, according to CNN.\n\nIn its January assessment, Russian state media outlets like Sputnik and RT were identified as some of the main pushers of fake news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne example was a story pushed by RT and Sputnik about a Turkish air force base being overrun by terrorists. Within 75 minutes, Watts and his colleagues tracked 4,000 tweets spreading the fake story. The hashtags used to push the story were #nuclear, #media, #Trump and #Benghazi. In the profiles pushing the tweets, the most common words were \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201ccountry,\u201d \u201cconservative,\u201d \u201cChristian,\u201d \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cConstitution.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump instinctively repeated the words \u201cradical Islam,\u201d which he knew would rile up large segments of the country. Many Trump supporters hold racist views toward Muslims, immigration and black people, something the Russians could easily exploit.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Russia, you\u2019re going to pay attention to that because that\u2019s your job to know what the opposition is doing and what\u2019s a viable opposition to invest in,\u201d a former CIA counterterrorism officer who tracked online messaging of terrorists in the Middle East told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe officer, who asked that his name not be used because of the nature of his past intelligence work, said that there was a time when one could argue that white nationalist (or alt-right) supporters would not be a target audience to invest in because it was unlikely they\u2019d gain power. But last year\u2019s election proved that exploiting racism is a viable target for a hostile intelligence agency.\n\n\u201cA lot of Americans tend to think [common sense] will reign,\u201dthe officer said. \u201cWe won\u2019t get to the visceral nature. But that can happen to people when they think America is not working for them anymore. You get back to the base tactics of \u2018I hate everybody. We have two oceans. I don\u2019t give a damn about anybody.\u2019 Then you get Trump.\u201d\n\nRussia (and America) Has a Long History of Exploiting Racial Strife for Political Gain\n\nIn order for fake news to work, you have to believe it. Our news feeds are saturated with misleading and false stories about any given subject, and it is up to readers to exercise media literacy to ascertain their validity. But human nature doesn\u2019t exactly work that way. We click on links that confirm our biases, whether the stories are true or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristian Gant, a former counterintelligence officer who spent more than four years at the FBI and the CIA conducting surveillance operations against Russian targets, said that part of any intelligence officer\u2019s job is to pick up on social discord that his agency can exploit. However, what was troubling about what Russia did was that it has convinced conservatives that it is not a bad thing to have relations with Russia. He said he is particularly troubled that elected officials like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) are essentially actively acting as Putin surrogates in Washington.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, you couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Gant said. \u201cBut President Putin was able to convince a large segment of the United States that Russians are not our enemy. That is a textbook covert influence campaign. And the way that you do that is find individuals who are apt to believe that [Russia is not our adversary] and you grasp on to their racism, lack of intellect and support a person like Donald Trump who panders to that. If Donald Trump says it\u2019s OK, then it must not be bad. You have Sean Hannity sending out tweets that say, \u2018Make Russia great again.\u2019 Had [CNN\u2019s] Don Lemon done that, they\u2019d be trying to put him in jail and calling him a traitor. Now you can say that and it is not a problem.\u201d\n\nNone of this is particularly surprising, given how effective the Kremlin is at the art of divide and conquer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2007, pro-Russia news sites pushed a story that the Estonian government had destroyed a World War II statue that carries strong emotional and historical sentiment for the Russian population that makes up 30 percent of Estonian citizens. The story was fake, but it stoked tensions among Russians who already felt marginalized by ethnic Estonians.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to look to Russia for examples of media manipulation designed to evoke the worst out of white Americans. The 1906 Atlanta race riots that resulted in the murders of black men and children by white mobs were spurred by local fake-news reports of black men raping white women.\n\nCliff Kuhn, a history professor at Georgia State University, told NPR that Atlanta\u2019s growing black population at the time led to racial anxiety that resulted in violent attacks on black people. But when local papers printed false stories of black men raping white people, it set off riots. Kuhn explains:\n\nNewsboys are hawking these editions: \u201cExtra! Extra! Read all about it!\u201d And at the corner of Pryor and Decatur Street, a man gets up on a soapbox and waves one of these newspaper headlines and says, \u201cAre we going to let them do this to our white women? Come on, boys!\u201d And the mob surges down Decatur Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reports were not true, but that didn\u2019t stop them from profiting from white Atlantans\u2019 racism, as Mark Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University, told NPR in the same report:\n\nThere was intense competition among newspapers, [with] four white papers in town. What builds up circulation more than race and sex, sensational stories of black men preying on white women? Editorials warned white women to stop sitting in the front seat of their carriages with their black drivers because a black man on the street who sees them will \u201cget ideas.\u201d\n\nAs we continue to observe the investigation into how Russia used fake news to manipulate the American populace, we must not forget that American media have historically done the same thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t take Russian spies acting on the Kremlin\u2019s orders to do it.\n\nIt will likely take months, or even years, to determine how much and to what degree Russia\u2019s use of fake news tapped into white Americans\u2019 racial anxiety. Though any results of the fake-news portion of Mueller\u2019s Russia collision investigation will have to confront the reality that white Americans\u2019 racial anxiety may have been riled up by lies spread on social media, motivating them to vote against their own self-interests and those of America.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re fucked up,\u201d the CIA operative told me. \u201cAmerica had to pass an IQ test.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week.

Omar Delgado, one of the first police to respond to the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is losing his job.\n\nHailed as a hero in the wake of the June 2016 mass shooting for saving the life of shooting victim Angel Colon, Delgado has since suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, after the massacre that left 49 people dead, Delgado returned to patrol duty with the Eatonville, Fla., Police Department for a few months but had to stop.\n\nHe told CNN that he has had trouble sleeping and suffered from nightmares, depression and anxiety. Delgado eventually took a desk job with the department, performing administrative duties for the past eight months.\n\nThen, this past Monday, the Eatonville PD told Delgado that his last day would be at the end of the month. Delgado is not sure exactly why he\u2019s being let go, and city officials wouldn\u2019t comment on the case, citing privacy policies. The officer says that a doctor had found him unfit to resume full duties because of his PTSD, which he believes was a factor in the city\u2019s decision to fire him.\n\nBut Delgado\u2014a nine-and-a-half-year veteran of the department\u2014is being forced out just six months before he can receive his full retirement pension and disability benefits. If he made the 10-year mark, the 45-year-old officer could receive 64 percent of his salary and benefits for life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of Delgado\u2019s firing, however, means that Delgado is entitled to disability or a retirement pension, but not both, according to WESH-TV. As it stands, Delgado will only receive 42 percent of his salary (his disability pension), which will kick in when he turns 55.\n\nDelgado said that the departmental policy was news to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a police officer with my gun belt and so forth to do those little tasks,\u201d Delgado said about his administrative work. \u201cCould they have let me do that for six more months? That\u2019s the debate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time magazine notes, Delgado isn\u2019t the first officer who responded to the Pulse-nightclub shooting to be fired following a PTSD diagnosis. The Orlando Police Department let go Officer Gerry Realin, 37, in July. However, Realin will receive 80 percent of his $70,000 salary each year for the rest of life. Compare that with Delgado, who stands to receive 42 percent of his $38,5000 salary annually.\n\nBut Eatonville, the home of Zora Neale Hurston and the oldest incorporated African-American town in the country, is reportedly strapped for cash. The Eatonville Town Council, following a harsh backlash to news of Delgado\u2019s firing (WESH-TV reports that city officials have received death threats), voted unanimously to give Delgado an additional $1,200. The city also said that it would continue to help the officer with PTSD counseling.\n\nA blog posted on Psychology Today says that out of roughly 900,000 sworn officers in the U.S., approximately 19 percent may have PTSD. Some research also suggests that another 34 percent of law enforcement officers may suffer from symptoms of PTSD but \u201cdo not meet the standards for the full diagnosis.\u201d (Note: This blog also tells us to take time to \u201csmile at a cop,\u201d since their jobs are so stressful, which is cute but also horseshit. Cops suffering from PTSD need real institutional support, and it\u2019s unclear whether Delgado really received it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, PTSD is not covered by workers\u2019 compensation in Florida. As the Orlando Sentinel notes, a proposed bill requiring first responders with PTSD to receive coverage for mental health treatment in their workers\u2019 compensation packages advanced this week in the Florida Senate.\n\nAngel Colon, the man whose life Delgado saved last year, told Fox 35 that the Eatonville Police Department should support the veteran officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling because this man, Omar, has been there for me ever since June 12,\u201d Colon said, according to the Sentinel. \u201cHe\u2019s the person who saved my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["orlando", "receive", "pulse", "life", "job", "eatonville", "months", "suffering", "massacre", "lose", "ptsd", "delgado", "cop", "officer", "salary", "pension"], "polarity": 0.020723684210526307, "subjectivity": 0.3847953216374269},

Two of them, it appears, would apply in Kelley\u2019s case: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison\u2014i.e., the assault of his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years\u2014and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Air Force will also be investigating whether other convictions had not been reported to the federal database for firearms background checks, according to the Times.\n\nAcademy Sports, a firearms retailer, confirmed Monday that Kelley had bought two weapons from its stores after clearing federal background checks this year and last year, according to the Post. It is still not clear whether those weapons were the ones that were used in Sunday\u2019s massacre, but nonetheless, it showcases the Air Force\u2019s failure to follow Pentagon guidelines in making sure that certain violent offenses get reported to the FBI.\n\nA separate law should have prevented Kelley, a violent offender, from purchasing the body armor that he was seen wearing during the mass shooting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeoffery Corn, a former Army lawyer and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, told the Post that there seems to be some confusion in the armed forces about what gets reported to authorities.\n\nThe Post notes:\n\nCorn said it appears there is confusion within the Air Force, and other military branches, about only reporting violent crimes that result in dishonorable discharges, which are more severe punishments under military law than the bad-conduct discharge Kelley received. \u201cEither the Department of Defense is reporting these convictions, or they\u2019re not,\u201d Corn said. \u201cHow is the federal statute going to be effectively implemented if they aren\u2019t reporting these convictions?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times notes that Kelley\u2019s bad-conduct discharge does not, in and of itself, mean an automatic ban from purchasing guns.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nThe Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show.

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["gun", "american", "violence", "day", "killed", "america", "children", "control", "firearm", "number", "shot", "kids", "study", "texas"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["president", "pretend", "trump", "shooting", "school", "speech", "mental", "took", "thats", "health", "republicans", "cares", "dont", "shootings", "listened"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says that the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry.

While the government claims pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003, to protect against brain damage.

He\u2019s a liar who\u2019s been caught lying about his interactions with Russia.\n\n\n\nAnd as if you need any more proof that Sessions is an asshole, he hates weed with a passion normally reserved for scorned lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this newly released video obtained by ABC News under the Freedom of Information Act might be the biggest proof of what a complete asshole Sessions is.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer portion with Justice Department interns, Sessions was addressed by a University of California, Berkeley School of Law student who noted that his question came with the memory of Philando Castile and Michael Brown, two African Americans who were killed by police officers in separate incidents that drew national attention, and others who have \u201cfallen victim to excessive force.\u201d\n\nThe student added that he \u201cgrew up in the projects to a single mother, and the people who we are afraid of are not necessarily our neighbors but the police.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions interrupted so the student never got the chance to actually ask a question and noted, \u201cWell, that may be the view in Berkeley, but it\u2019s not the view in most places in the country.\u201d\n\nThe student tried to interject that he wasn\u2019t talking about Berkeley, but why would that stop Sessions? Sessions continued by saying that the over-policing of black communities is needed to \u201cconfront violent crime in America in cities that have abandoned traditional police activity like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Sessions also pushed a popular right-wing narrative that murder rates \u201chave surged, particularly in poor neighborhoods,\u201d which thereby constitutes over-policing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that Sessions\u2019 position was dismissive as the way in which he cavalierly acted as if the student had no fucking clue what he was talking about. It also doesn\u2019t help that the student never got to ask a question because the asshole just couldn\u2019t wait to interrupt and answer something that wasn\u2019t asked.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s move over to the peak level of Sessions\u2019 assholishness.\n\nHere\u2019s how Politico described the interaction:\n\nAnother student, a woman attending Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, told the attorney general that \u201cstatistically, guns kill more people than marijuana does.\u201d \u201cYou support pretty harsh policies for marijuana and pretty lax gun control laws \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure where you stand on the assault weapons ban,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to know, since guns kill more people than marijuana, why lax laws on one and harsh laws on the other?\u201d Sessions laughed and called her question one of \u201capples and oranges\u201d before remarking: \u201cThe Second Amendment \u2014 you\u2019re aware of that \u2014 guarantees the right of the American people to keep arms, and I intend to defend that Second Amendment. It\u2019s as valid as the First Amendment.\u201d The attorney general knocked the notion that marijuana is \u201charmless\u201d and \u201cdoes no damage.\u201d \u201cMarijuana is not a healthy substance, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Medical Association is crystal clear on that. Do you believe that?\u201d The student hesitated. \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cOK. Dr. Whatever Your Name Is, you can write the AMA and see why they think otherwise,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Asshole Book of Commandments, Chapter 6, verse 1, it clearly states that giving someone a title that you know they don\u2019t have to prove that they don\u2019t know what they are talking about makes you an asshole. It wasn\u2019t as if the students were being belligerent. Based on his policy and position, they were asking for clarity, but you know what they say about asking assholes questions: You\u2019re bound to get shitty answers.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nAlso, fuck Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead more at ABC News and Politico.", "keywords": ["student", "wasnt", "sessions", "justice", "held", "confirms", "video", "complete", "department", "belief", "asshole", "know", "question", "talking", "marijuana", "widely", "attorney", "jeff", "general"], "polarity": 0.1055940129053336, "subjectivity": 0.49059939012769194},

Even with multiple state legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. Attorney General has it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month to encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court. A federal lawsuit filed against Sessions and the DEA in Manhattan in July has hit the docket Wednesday, the New York Times reports, and now both sides will have the opportunity to present their case before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case include former NFL player Marvin Washington, who says his business interests in states where marijuana is legal are being impeded by the Controlled Substances Act. Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says that the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry. They claim that the Controlled Substances Act has been used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph A. Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit, told the Times, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has stood up to the government to be able to use it. It\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also points out blatant hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government when it comes to marijuana. While the government claims pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003, to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too. If you only decided case law based upon what people thought years before, we would never have Brown v. Board of Education. \u2026 We would never have Windsor. We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality.\u201d\n\nJudge Hellerstein openly admitted in court that marijuana does not meet one of the three requirements for Schedule I drug status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,\u201d Hellerstein said to Hiller during the hearing. \u201cI have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true. How could anyone say that your clients\u2019 lives have not been saved by marijuana? How can anyone say that your clients\u2019 pain and suffering has not been alleviated by marijuana? You can\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\nBut Hellerstein also questioned whether the DOJ decision should be challenged in district court.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things district judges have to do,\u201d Hellerstein said. \u201cWhen agencies are set up to do the very kind of thing that you want me to do, I think the right thing is to defer to the agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHellerstein did, however, delay making a decision on the government\u2019s request to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to consider the issues over the next several days or weeks until he comes to a conclusion,\u201d Hiller said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the judge allows the suit to move forward, because making marijuana a Schedule I drug is one of the more ridiculous moves our government has made.", "keywords": ["law", "sessions", "told", "vs", "clients", "federal", "washington", "court", "hellerstein", "begins", "young", "hiller", "marijuana", "case", "jeff", "battle", "act"], "polarity": 0.0763360044211108, "subjectivity": 0.3941696601271069},

That pretend war will now see him in court as he goes up against a 12-year-old girl who suffers from epilepsy.\n\nAlexis Bortell was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2013. She began taking medical marijuana three years ago, and her seizures disappeared. Newsweek reports that Alexis filed a lawsuit against Sessions last fall because he has made it his mission to impede access to the one drug that has been able to help her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case goes before a judge in a New York City federal court on Feb. 14. Attorney Michael Hiller will be there to represent Alexis, and he told Newsweek that he believes the ruling will go their way.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that the case is going to come out the way it should, which is that the Controlled Substances Act is going to be found unconstitutional,\u201d Hiller told the magazine.\n\nTheir case involves several other plaintiffs, including a former professional football player, a veteran and another child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe seizures Alexis suffered were so bad that her family moved from Texas to Colorado so she could have access to products made with marijuana.\n\nThere is science that supports the evidence that Alexis is experiencing relief with cannabis products. There have been clinical trials that have shown CBD\u2014or cannabidiol, a marijuana extract\u2014to be effective in treating seizure disorders.\n\nDr. Jerzy Szaflarski, director of the epilepsy center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told Newsweek that CBD could be working along about a dozen different pathways and receptors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe evidence for each and every one of those pathways is there, but it\u2019s relatively weak,\u201d Szaflarski said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while before we sort this out.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government, however, believes that there are no medical applications for marijuana.

Being president comes with compromises that we don\u2019t require in our celebrities and public figures, and I\u2019m not sure the Americans who want her to run for president completely comprehend that. . . .\u201d\n\nWriting in the New York Times from Paris, Thomas Chatterton Williams cautioned, \u201cIf the first year of the Trump administration has made anything clear, it\u2019s that experience, knowledge, education and political wisdom matter tremendously. . . .The presidency is not a reality show, or for that matter, a talk show. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA social media user posted a 2015 piece from Nicole Aschoff in the Guardian questioning even whether the Oprah philosophy is suited for the presidency.\n\nIt was headlined \u201cOprah Winfrey: one of the world\u2019s best neoliberal capitalist thinkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOprah recognizes the pervasiveness of anxiety and alienation in our society,\u201d Aschoff wrote. \u201cBut instead of examining the economic or political basis of these feelings, she advises us to turn our gaze inward and reconfigure ourselves to become more adaptable to the vagaries and stresses of the neoliberal moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOprah is appealing precisely because her stories hide the role of political, economic, and social structures. In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it.

What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media.

Even with multiple state legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. Attorney General has it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month to encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court. A federal lawsuit filed against Sessions and the DEA in Manhattan in July has hit the docket Wednesday, the New York Times reports, and now both sides will have the opportunity to present their case before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case include former NFL player Marvin Washington, who says his business interests in states where marijuana is legal are being impeded by the Controlled Substances Act. Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says that the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry. They claim that the Controlled Substances Act has been used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph A. Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit, told the Times, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has stood up to the government to be able to use it. It\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also points out blatant hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government when it comes to marijuana. While the government claims pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003, to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too. If you only decided case law based upon what people thought years before, we would never have Brown v. Board of Education. \u2026 We would never have Windsor. We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality.\u201d\n\nJudge Hellerstein openly admitted in court that marijuana does not meet one of the three requirements for Schedule I drug status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,\u201d Hellerstein said to Hiller during the hearing. \u201cI have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true.

You can\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\nBut Hellerstein also questioned whether the DOJ decision should be challenged in district court.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things district judges have to do,\u201d Hellerstein said. \u201cWhen agencies are set up to do the very kind of thing that you want me to do, I think the right thing is to defer to the agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHellerstein did, however, delay making a decision on the government\u2019s request to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to consider the issues over the next several days or weeks until he comes to a conclusion,\u201d Hiller said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the judge allows the suit to move forward, because making marijuana a Schedule I drug is one of the more ridiculous moves our government has made.", "keywords": ["law", "sessions", "told", "vs", "clients", "federal", "washington", "court", "hellerstein", "begins", "young", "hiller", "marijuana", "case", "jeff", "battle", "act"], "polarity": 0.0763360044211108, "subjectivity": 0.3941696601271069},

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

COPS also made reform recommendations to troubled departments and provided guidance and technical support.\n\nOne such department was the San Francisco Police Department.

But I found the strange Facebook response of \u2018Oprah 2020' weirdly discordant and disorienting. Oprah\u2019s speech \u2014 in my hearing \u2014 wasn\u2019t about why she needs to run for office. It was about why the rest of us need to do so, immediately. . . .\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, Lithwick said that \u201cthe rest of us\u201d includes journalists, to whom Oprah Winfrey gave a shout-out.

The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media.

It couldn\u2019t possibly be because the president of the United States and the overlord of Russia are secretly play cousins who spend the night over each other\u2019s house and make forts out of bedsheets in the basement of the White House and read books with flashlights, could it?\n\n\n\nEver since news broke of a possible scandal involving Russia and the subsequent investigation, there have been rumors that Trump wanted Sessions to stay involved. Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal. In fact, during a July press conference, Trump blatantly stated that he didn\u2019t believe that Sessions should have taken himself out of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe should not have recused himself from the Russia investigation almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne thing has been consistent since Trump took office, and that\u2019s the fact that skullduggery, lying and Russia\u2019s raiding of the White House fridge at ungodly hours is the new state of the nation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes out of this administration; at this point, this is how I feel about every claim lobbed at the president:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times and NBC News.", "keywords": ["white", "russia", "trump", "sessions", "probe", "times", "recused", "reports", "report", "jeff", "persuade", "recuse", "lawyer", "investigation", "house", "urged"], "polarity": 0.020730027548209365, "subjectivity": 0.3796700773973502},

Seriously, why is King Keebler, the attorney general of the United States, so hell-bent on taking the good herb away from the people?\n\n\n\nWhile the president is out here having a nuclear-button-measuring contest with the equally unstable (yet starting to look more sane than Donald Trump) supreme leader of North Korea, on Thursday, Sessions decided that he\u2019s going to continue the Trump mandate of undoing President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy by rescinding the policy of not interfering with marijuana-friendly state laws, CNN reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news site notes that many states have decriminalized or legalized weed use, but because the drug is still illegal under federal laws, and an elf face whose middle name is Beauregard\u2014which had to be impossible as a child, even a child who attended Klan Kids Kindergarten\u2014is insistent on hating us all.\n\nAccording to CNN, the Obama administration took a more hands-off approach to marijuana in states where the harmless happiness had been legalized. As long as the weed smoker wasn\u2019t attached to a cartel or distributing the drug to minors, police could basically behave like security at a Cypress Hill concert.\n\nNo one knows how Sessions plans to proceed because, like most things with this Azealia Banks-ass administration, rescinding Obama policy seems to be the only focus. It\u2019s unclear whether states where pot is legal will revert to the old policies regarding federal enforcement or if King Keebler will enact a new policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the belief is that Sessions plans to use federal laws to crack down on legal-weed states because he\u2019s an asshole who hasn\u2019t deal with his deep-seeded weed issues. Surely it isn\u2019t accidental that Sessions\u2019 announcement comes just days after California became the largest state to make recreational use of marijuana legal.\n\nWhat happened to Beauregard to make him this way?

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["safe", "law", "sessions", "crime", "watch", "hook", "america", "enforcement", "dishonest", "continues", "drug", "rates", "tour", "violent", "nearly", "increase"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report. He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked. Sessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committe hearing with Rosenstein, Bass again wanted answers about documents coming from the FBI that appear to indirectly label the Black Lives Matter movement as a terrorist organization that threatens police. She also noted that members of the Black Lives Matter movement have been questioned by the FBI, yet no one seems to know anything about the document or how the conclusions in said document were made.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller.

I didn\u2019t smoke weed in front of her. What I actually did was whip out a joint and tell her I was going to smoke it in her bathroom, where she regularly smokes her cigarettes to keep her apartment from smelling like tobacco. So I was actually trying to be respectful by hotboxing her bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she saw the joint, she made that face mothers make right before they say, \u201cWhat you not gon\u2019 do \u2026 \u201d But my mother didn\u2019t say anything. She just shook her head and walked away.\n\n\n\nNow, my mom kinda suspected that I was a weed smoker. But when California finally legalized recreational marijuana\u2014or adult use of marijuana, which some pro-cannabis activists prefer because, honestly, no one ever says \u201crecreational alcohol\u201d or \u201crecreational cigarettes\u201d about the two legal vices enjoyed and consumed by grown-ass people\u2014I thought it was time to clear the air, so to speak, and make it plain that I do enjoy legal weed, just as she enjoys her legal cigarettes.\n\nI mention this story because it appears that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be back on that bullshit about cracking down on marijuana. On Friday he met with a group of anti-legalization activists behind closed doors, and I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t swapping Christmas-cookie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, Sessions has never met with pro-pot activists during his first year in office. And last week, a video emerged showing Sessions in full asshole mode mocking a Department of Justice intern about her stance on marijuana while making a few misleading statements of his own (more on that later).\n\nSessions, who\u2019s been pretty wishy-washy about marijuana policy as attorney general, has famously said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d But that statement defies logic when you consider that 29 states have legalized medical marijuana and seven states plus Washington, D.C., have co-signed recreational weed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know any good people, which isn\u2019t hard to believe, to be honest.\n\nBut Sessions aside, there is still a pretty strong social stigma around people who use weed. The image of the stoner stuck on a couch eating Cheetos is probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of a weed smoker, which is why it\u2019s time for the good, weed-smoking people of America to let it be known that they happily puff-puff-pass while still managing to contribute to society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence has shown that weed is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, yet the federal government classifies it as a Schedule I drug, the highest classification, which puts marijuana on par with heroin. Our government thinks weed is more dangerous than Schedule II drugs cocaine and crystal meth, which is fucking bananas.\n\nSessions once even claimed that marijuana was \u201conly less awful than heroin,\u201d which is utter horseshit when you consider that the number of overdoses from opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers skyrocketed in 2016. (Sessions just recently conceded that weed isn\u2019t as bad as heroin. Gee, thanks, little buddy!)\n\nYou know how many people have died from a marijuana overdose in the history of marijuana? Zero.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study even suggested that opiate-related deaths went down after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, and some experts believe that cannabis could actually help ease the abuse of opioids, which account for 63 percent of all drug-related deaths.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of opioids, in that video with the intern, Sessions claimed that last year was the first time that drugs rather than alcohol caused more fatal car accidents. He\u2019s basically correct on that point (the year was actually 2015), except the issue is more nuanced than that.\n\nSince police still don\u2019t have a reliable DUI test for weed (officers are mainly just judging behavior to determine if a driver is high), it\u2019s difficult to know what role, if any, weed may have played in an accident, especially since marijuana stays in your system awhile after actual use. But what Sessions failed to mention is that there\u2019s also been a huge spike in prescription-opioid-related fatal car crashes (however, the same rule about no reliable DUI test also applies to opioids).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also asked that intern to check with the American Medical Association about the dangers of marijuana. Again, while Sessions is right that the AMA says marijuana is a dangerous drug and recreational weed should not be legalized, he didn\u2019t mention that the organization has also called for more research on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis. Because legalization is moving way faster than research, rescheduling the drug to open up scientific study makes even more sense from a public health point of view.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that black and brown people are still getting arrested at higher rates for marijuana possession, even in states with legal weed, so coming out wholeheartedly as a weed smoker still carries some real-life consequences (the prohibition of weed has always been primarily about race).\n\nBut really, the best way to destroy the stereotypical image of a pothead is to replace it with an image that looks more like you and me.

This isn\u2019t debatable. He\u2019s such an asshole that God\u2019s greatest grandma, Coretta Scott King, once wrote a letter to block Sessions from becoming a federal judge. One of his major policies since becoming attorney general has been green-lighting policy that allows police to take the cash and/or property of people suspected of but not charged with crimes. He\u2019s a liar who\u2019s been caught lying about his interactions with Russia.\n\n\n\nAnd as if you need any more proof that Sessions is an asshole, he hates weed with a passion normally reserved for scorned lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this newly released video obtained by ABC News under the Freedom of Information Act might be the biggest proof of what a complete asshole Sessions is.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer portion with Justice Department interns, Sessions was addressed by a University of California, Berkeley School of Law student who noted that his question came with the memory of Philando Castile and Michael Brown, two African Americans who were killed by police officers in separate incidents that drew national attention, and others who have \u201cfallen victim to excessive force.\u201d\n\nThe student added that he \u201cgrew up in the projects to a single mother, and the people who we are afraid of are not necessarily our neighbors but the police.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions interrupted so the student never got the chance to actually ask a question and noted, \u201cWell, that may be the view in Berkeley, but it\u2019s not the view in most places in the country.\u201d\n\nThe student tried to interject that he wasn\u2019t talking about Berkeley, but why would that stop Sessions? Sessions continued by saying that the over-policing of black communities is needed to \u201cconfront violent crime in America in cities that have abandoned traditional police activity like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Sessions also pushed a popular right-wing narrative that murder rates \u201chave surged, particularly in poor neighborhoods,\u201d which thereby constitutes over-policing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that Sessions\u2019 position was dismissive as the way in which he cavalierly acted as if the student had no fucking clue what he was talking about. It also doesn\u2019t help that the student never got to ask a question because the asshole just couldn\u2019t wait to interrupt and answer something that wasn\u2019t asked.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s move over to the peak level of Sessions\u2019 assholishness.\n\nHere\u2019s how Politico described the interaction:\n\nAnother student, a woman attending Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, told the attorney general that \u201cstatistically, guns kill more people than marijuana does.\u201d \u201cYou support pretty harsh policies for marijuana and pretty lax gun control laws \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure where you stand on the assault weapons ban,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to know, since guns kill more people than marijuana, why lax laws on one and harsh laws on the other?\u201d Sessions laughed and called her question one of \u201capples and oranges\u201d before remarking: \u201cThe Second Amendment \u2014 you\u2019re aware of that \u2014 guarantees the right of the American people to keep arms, and I intend to defend that Second Amendment. It\u2019s as valid as the First Amendment.\u201d The attorney general knocked the notion that marijuana is \u201charmless\u201d and \u201cdoes no damage.\u201d \u201cMarijuana is not a healthy substance, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Medical Association is crystal clear on that. Do you believe that?\u201d The student hesitated. \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cOK. Dr. Whatever Your Name Is, you can write the AMA and see why they think otherwise,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Asshole Book of Commandments, Chapter 6, verse 1, it clearly states that giving someone a title that you know they don\u2019t have to prove that they don\u2019t know what they are talking about makes you an asshole. It wasn\u2019t as if the students were being belligerent. Based on his policy and position, they were asking for clarity, but you know what they say about asking assholes questions: You\u2019re bound to get shitty answers.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nAlso, fuck Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead more at ABC News and Politico.", "keywords": ["student", "wasnt", "sessions", "justice", "held", "confirms", "video", "complete", "department", "belief", "asshole", "know", "question", "talking", "marijuana", "widely", "attorney", "jeff", "general"], "polarity": 0.1055940129053336, "subjectivity": 0.49059939012769194},

Really, it\u2019s fucked up for two reasons: the first being that it feeds into the idea that vigilante white people have the right and the duty to actively and personally fight crime, but like less Batman and more George Zimmerman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis perpetuates the continual cycle of the criminalization of black existence. Their logic: Why would a black person go to a store unless they were there to steal, right? It\u2019s not like we need shit like clothes and home furnishings, too.\n\nThe second fucked-up thing about it is, well, for a lot of these retail workers/freelance espionage agents, they wouldn\u2019t be able to shop at the store they\u2019re working in if they ain\u2019t get the discount themselves.

I mean, how do we know Chris really exists or if he\u2019s just some imaginary entity that they made up precisely for the moments when an actual black person confronts them about their real racism?

You never asked them about the Wu-Tang Clan. You never told them about the Wu-Tang Clan. They just assumed that, because you are black, you enjoy the Wu-Tang Clan and now you all have something in common and now you\u2019re friends (which they\u2019ll use later when referencing you as their black-people pope).\n\nSo we\u2019re clear, it\u2019s possible to enjoy black things while still hating black people.

Or did they? They can\u2019t recall exactly. If they did, it wasn\u2019t improper, and it was definitely in self-defense.\n\n\n\nMichael Slager, a former North Charleston, S.C., cop, is currently standing trial for the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist. While criminal charges against Slager ended in a mistrial last year, Slager has pleaded guilty to federal charges of deprivation of rights under the color of law. In doing so, Slager owned up to using excessive force in Scott\u2019s death, admitting that he hadn\u2019t shot Scott in self-defense as he originally claimed (cellphone video caught Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Slager\u2019s attorneys say, the ex-cop wasn\u2019t lying. He was just stressed out. And they\u2019re using Jeff Sessions\u2019 \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d (read: trash) memory as evidence.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, federal prosecutors are seeking an enhanced sentence against Slager for obstruction of justice\u2014a punishment that they feel he deserves for lying his ass off for two years. But defense lawyers claimed in a federal court filing last week that Slager\u2019s inconsistent accounts of Scott\u2019s death were the result of intense pressure.\n\n\u201cA Swiss cheese memory is a symptom of stress, not an indicator of lying,\u201d they wrote, including testimony from a medical expert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause this is 2017, Slager\u2019s attorneys then cited Sessions\u2019 conflicting and ever changing accounts of his contact with Russian agents as an example.\n\nHere is their argument, from the Post:\n\n\u201cUnlike Slager, who had been in what he perceived a life and death struggle before he made his statements, Sessions had time to prepare for his Congressional testimony, yet still often got it wrong,\u201d they wrote in their filing. \u201cWhy? According to Sessions, he was working in chaotic conditions created by the Trump campaign,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis was undoubtedly stressful, though not as stressful as having shot a man to death, or dealing with the aftermath of that, or facing the death penalty or life in prison. As Sessions made clear in his statement, a failure to recall, or an inaccurate recollection, does not a liar make.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Slager\u2019s attorneys really believe that Sessions was being honest in his congressional testimony? It\u2019s possible. But citing Sessions is a calculated move meant to put the Department of Justice\u2014whose prosecutors brought the federal charges against Slager\u2014in an awkward position. Essentially, DOJ prosecutors can\u2019t insist that Slager is a liar without implying, however indirectly, that their boss is probably one, too.\n\nIt\u2019s transparent as hell\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work.\n\nHere\u2019s another section from the defense filing:\n\n\u201cLike Sessions, Slager never lied or misled anyone,\u201d the defense attorneys\u2019 filing reads. \u201cLike Sessions, he answered the questions that were asked. When he had his memory refreshed, he added the refreshed recollection to his testimony. When he failed to remember certain items, it can be attributed to the stress or chaos of the event during which the memory should have been formed.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorally bankrupt courtroom arguments aren\u2019t unique to 2017. Neither, unfortunately, is police brutality. Still, this particular example\u2014a lying cop seeking a lighter sentence after killing an unarmed 50-year-old black man, a crime he now admits to, and citing a lying attorney general once deemed to be too racist to even be a federal judge\u2014feels like a fresh twist on an old, prolonged horror.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["death", "sessions", "federal", "testimony", "killed", "scott", "slagers", "attorneys", "sentence", "lighter", "lying", "walter", "memory", "slager", "jeff", "cop", "help"], "polarity": -0.022329931972789117, "subjectivity": 0.4935884353741497},

OK, sir.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d]\n\n\u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d\n\nBass cut him off.\n\n\u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question. It\u2019s easy to label black people who fight for racial justice and racism as the actual racists when we know that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t follow that question,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPlease again?\u201d\n\nBass then asked her question even more directly than she did the first time: \u201cIs there a term or a report on white identity extremists? You mentioned you are familiar with black people who identify with their racial identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not coming to me at this moment.\u201d\n\n[OK, sir. You can\u2019t remember the name of ONE white extremist group? Really, former senator of Alabama? Not ONE? OK.]\n\nBass was incredulous: \u201cNot coming to you?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t about to let Sessions off the hook that easily.\n\n\u201cCertainly a group such as the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d she said, in an attempt to jog his memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seemed to work. Suddenly Sessions remembered. \u201cYes, and then the skinhead movements, but there is racial identity white movements that have been identified for sure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo has the FBI done a report on white identity extremists that are likely motivated to target law-enforcement officers?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[So, no. Just say that, sir. You haven\u2019t. You haven\u2019t because you are OK with white extremist groups.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCould you name an African-American organization that has committed violent acts against police officers? Could you name one today? In this report, they name organizations from 30 or 40 years ago, but can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?\u201d Bass asked.\n\nGotcha! Sessions waffled and could not name any such organization, because as we all know, that is some extreme bullshit.\n\n\u201cI believe I could, but I would want to be, um, to confirm that and submit it to you in writing, but I believe we had in the last year or so four police officers killed by a group that some have described as extremist,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was referring to the shooting in Dallas or perhaps in Baton Rouge, La., that they tried to tie to Black Lives Matter, but we all know that was some bullshit, too.\n\nBass cut to the chase and asked the most necessary question, because we know exactly whom the FBI were talking about and whom they were targeting when they put out that fake-ass report.\n\n\u201cWould you consider Black Lives Matter a black identity extremist group?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to comment on that. I have not so declared it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAgain, Bass put out there what all of us have been thinking since that ridiculous report made the news, saying:\n\nSo, you should know that a lot of activists around the country are very concerned that we\u2019re getting ready to repeat a very sad chapter of our history, where people who are rightfully protesting what they consider to be an injustice in their community\u2014which is their relationship with police officers\u2014are now being targeted and labeled as extremists and are going through periods of surveillance and harassment, and so I would like to know, what is your department going to do to protect the rights of average citizens to protest if they have a concern about police officers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was quick to go on the offensive.\n\n\u201cThis department will not unlawfully target people,\u201d he said.\n\nBass then said:\n\nSo, if that\u2019s the case then, I would ask that you review this report\u2014\u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d\u2014because I personally don\u2019t believe that any such organizations exist. The organizations that are referred to in this report are organizations from decades ago, so I would like to know what will you do to essentially roll back what is listed in this report? Because it\u2019s not accurate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a pregnant pause while Sessions considered what lie he should let fly out of his mouth next.\n\nHe then said, \u201cWe will look at the report. I\u2019d actually be interested in reading it. But they usually do an excellent job\u2014objective and fair\u2014on those kind of reports.\u201d\n\n[Objective and fair? OK, Bilbo Bigot.]\n\nBass did a great job ripping into Sessions and getting him to basically admit that the \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d report was full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Lives Matter and other social groups that are fighting for racial equality and calling out the deaths of black men at the hands of police are not a threat to law enforcement. That is the narrative Sessions has been driving, however, since he took the job as attorney general. Enough is enough.\n\nSalute to Karen Bass.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

The article outlined the contours of their \u201crelationship\u201d in depressing detail. Moore is accused of plying the teenager with alcohol at his house, where, Corfman now says, he kissed her, partially undressed her and tried to get her to touch him sexually.\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe legal age of consent in Alabama, then and now, is 16. Under Alabama law in 1979, and today, a person who is at least 19 years old who has sexual contact with someone older than 12 and younger than 15 has committed sexual abuse in the second degree. Sexual contact is defined as touching of sexual or intimate parts. The crime is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail. The law then and now also includes a section on enticing a child younger than 16 to enter a home with the purpose of proposing sexual intercourse or fondling of sexual and genital parts. That is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post also interviewed three other women who say that \u201cMoore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they say they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women say that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact.\u201d\n\nReaction from those in his own party has been swift and severe.\n\n\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and National Republican Senate Committee Chairman Cory Gardner both released statements Thursday afternoon calling on Moore to drop out of the special Senate election after the accusations came to light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the leadership, prominent Republican pols spoke out Thursday afternoon, saying that Moore should bow out if the accusations are true. A chorus of them, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, say that he needs to hit the road.\n\nMoore is running to occupy the seat left open when Sessions became U.S. attorney general under President Donald Trump.\n\nNow 70, Moore has denied the allegations and says that they are motivated by the \u201cDemocrat Party\u201d and \u201cfake news,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Huffington Post reports that even if Moore withdraws, he cannot be easily replaced on the ballot, perhaps ensuring that the seat will fall to the Democratic challenger Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 election.\n\nIf that happens, the GOP will have an even smaller majority in the U.S. Senate, and Dems may be able to take the upper house back in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaints, keep praying.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["pressure", "post", "drop", "candidate", "relationship", "sexually", "say", "republican", "senate", "gop", "roy", "ala", "moore", "alabama", "faces", "sexual", "sen", "washington"], "polarity": 0.14381720430107525, "subjectivity": 0.45650921658986165},

The measure would strike the death penalty from being considered as a sentencing option for aggravated murder. If the bill passes, the harshest sentence in the state would instead be life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Statehouse, which has a two-person Democratic majority.\n\nThanks to Gov. Jay Inslee, there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington since 2014.\n\nLawmakers cited the cost of maintaining the death penalty and incidences of wrongful convictions as reasons to abolish capital punishment. According to the Times, one Seattle University study from 2015 found that death-penalty cases in Washington \u201ccost $1 million more than similar cases where capital punishment [was] not sought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the co-sponsors of the bill, state Sen.

This unequal application of the punishment was among the reasons Gov. Inslee instilled the moratorium.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nIn a written statement issued after the vote, Inslee said that when he enacted the moratorium, \u201cI hoped it would create space for a discussion about the unequal application of this law, the enormous costs of seeking this punishment and the uncertainty of closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d \u201cI hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the bill passes in the Statehouse, Washington will join 19 other states and the District of Columbia in ridding themselves of the death penalty.

With no action necessary from people who were convicted, 3,038 misdemeanor convictions will be dismissed and sealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, NPR reports, prosecutors will review nearly 5,000 additional felony convictions to see if they can be reduced to misdemeanors.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the dismissals will happen automatically, requiring no effort on the part of those with marijuana-related offenses on their records to expunge those convictions themselves. Gasc\u00f3n, in a statement, noted that although petitioning to have these records cleared has been in place in San Francisco, the process is costly and can require legal help. It was noted that only 23 such petitions were filed in the last year.\n\nThe decision will disproportionately affect the city\u2019s black and Latinx residents, who\u2019ve been arrested at far greater rates than their white peers throughout the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NPR, which cites numbers from the district attorney\u2019s office, San Francisco\u2019s black residents made up just 7.8 percent of the city\u2019s population but made up 41 percent of marijuana-related arrests in 2000. A decade later, even though the percentage of black people living in San Francisco dropped (to 6 percent), they made up an even greater share of marijuana-related arrests, at nearly 50 percent.\n\nThat number was even worse than California\u2019s statewide average. According to a 2016 study by New Frontier Data, a firm that provides data analytics on the cannabis industry, nearly a quarter of all people jailed for marijuana-only offenses were black\u2014even though black, Latino and white people consume marijuana at similar rates.\n\nIn a statement that stands in sharp contrast to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice\u2019s new drug policies, Gasc\u00f3n said that San Francisco was \u201ctaking the lead to undo the damage that this country\u2019s disastrous, failed drug war has had on our nation and on communities of color in particular.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further emphasized the racial disparities in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cWe know there were tremendous failures in the war on drugs, and we criminalized large sections of our community,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThe African-American and Latino communities were the most harmed by this.\u201d\n\nLt.

He was the white Umar Johnson and Tariq Nasheed for President Donald Trump\u2019s run to the presidency, but then he got booted out of the Oval Office after several reported dustups with the president\u2019s real daughter, Ivanka Trump, and his fake daughter, Hope Hicks.\n\nBannon announced that he was going back to his old life of being the head of Breitbart, communiqu\u00e9 for racists and aspiring racists. But then Fire and Fury, the book poised to bring down the White House, was released, and now Bannon was talking mad reckless about his former employer. Meanwhile, the White House has gone on record noting that it doesn\u2019t fuck with him, and now he\u2019s out at Breitbart.\n\nThat\u2019s right. According to ABC News, the Prince of Potato Skin is stepping down from his role at the alt-right alternative. Below are five possible jobs Bannon can consider now that he finds himself unemployed.\n\n\n\n1. Walmart Greeter\n\nRacists love some Walmart, mostly because it\u2019s a one-stop shop for racism. You can get a tiki torch, khakis, a gun, hair gel, megaphone, suspenders, denim overalls, camouflage shit and thermos. It\u2019s literally racism\u2019s favorite store, and what better than the commander of the alt-right there to greet you as you enter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Craft-Beer-Maker\n\nThis actually serves two purposes. One, it gives Bannon employment, and two, he\u2019d have to grow a beard, which would cover most of his face, which we can all admit looks like rotten potato skin. Nothing says white man like microbrewing beer, as blacks don\u2019t really consume craft beers, so the market and the creation is inherently racist, making it a perfect fit for someone like Bannon, who\u2019s already halfway there in his Barbour coats.\n\n3. The Tech Industry\n\nI don\u2019t know whether or not Bannon has skills in this area, but I know that this area loves white men. In fact, this industry talks a big diversity game, but in a survey conducted by Stack Overflow\u2014which polled 11,445 developers in the U.S., 85.5 percent of whom were men, and a majority of whom were white\u2014when asked how important the overall diversity of a company was in determining whether they wanted to work there, respondents scored the issue, on average, 1.9 out of 5, making it their least important consideration. Proving that white men are fine with keeping tech America white, and Bannon would love nothing more than to continue this trend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Lumberjack\n\nSeriously, have you ever seen a black lumberjack?\n\n5. Domestic Terrorist\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be that far off from the work that he was doing in the White House. America\u2019s terrorist problem is overwhelmingly white and male. In order to be a domestic terrorist, you need a certain level of cowardice, hatred and a history of racism, all of which Bannon has in spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the comic book world of Bannon\u2019s life, this would be the part where he goes underground, only to emerge as a more sinister character. Let\u2019s hope for all of our sakes that that isn\u2019t the case, but considering that Bannon is grossly overqualified for this position, I\u2019m not holding my breath.", "keywords": ["white", "house", "terrorist", "jobs", "walmart", "skin", "steve", "work", "sloppy", "bannon", "men", "tech", "hes", "altright", "breitbart"], "polarity": 0.07556584362139918, "subjectivity": 0.4015726043503822},

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["trump", "pleading", "subtweet", "guilty", "flynn", "pence", "james", "michael", "lying", "russian", "pleaded", "charges", "statement", "releases", "sing", "responds", "times"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["white", "justice", "nfl", "shooting", "juror", "parish", "mcknight", "black", "jury", "jefferson", "joe", "woman", "gasser", "player", "help"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

That is a clear indication that Flynn might be negotiating a plea deal that could include him testifying against the president or senior White House officials, according to the report.\n\nThose negotiations would include prosecutors telling Flynn, off the record, of course, the evidence they have against him.

The departmental also confirmed that it will be examining its policy on texts that are allowed, as well as \u201call current lists of banned written materials.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, even though at least two prisons in the state had the book on the no-go list, the Department of Corrections noted that the book was used by the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education Program, which gives inmates the opportunity to enroll in college-level courses, citing that as one of the reasons the ban was lifted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOfficials determined that the book should not have been banned, as evidenced by the fact that it is being utilized as a teaching tool for NJ-STEP students.\u201d New Jersey Department of Corrections spokesperson Matthew Schuman told the Times.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA lot of things look funny in the light, and when prisons ban a critically acclaimed book about the discrimination black people face in the criminal-justice system ... well, that\u2019s more than a little funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, according to The Guardian, that\u2019s exactly what is happening in some prisons in New Jersey, which have reportedly banned Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness .\n\nRecords obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through a public-records request show that the book, which was published in 2010, is on lists of publications inmates in state facilities may not possess.

Magazines appealing to a \u201cprurient interest in sex,\u201d as well as magazines about hip-hop and black culture, are also banned.\n\nThe records, according to the report, do not make it clear why Alexander\u2019s book was put on the no-go list at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton and Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure we can hazard a few guesses.\n\nRead more at The Guardian.", "keywords": ["jersey", "publications", "department", "inmates", "jim", "corrections", "ban", "crow", "prisons", "lift", "book", "state", "awardwinning", "aclu"], "polarity": 0.13807569745069745, "subjectivity": 0.5116081449414783},

Ahhh, yes! The White House press briefing.

But because this administration\u2019s motto is \u201c(Lie) faster, (cheat) higher, (bullshit) stronger,\u201d Sanders also added in a three-minute-long word problem and her best Mariah Carey impersonation.\n\nSanders wore Pepto Bismol pink to lie-apalooza the press conference, maybe because all the lies she was about to spew forth on the taxpayer dime were giving her a bad case of the bubble guts.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\nLOL, Sarah, Quit Playing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders, who shares genes with a man who easily cracks the top three least-funny men on the planet, opted to begin the briefing with a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic I know all of you are preparing to ask me about,\u201d Sanders said to a room full of stressed-out political reporters who did not have time for this. \u201cTax reform.\u201d\n\nOhohohohoh Sarah!

To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part. Watch as she proverbially clutches her faux pearls in faux-righteous anger and asks, But why aren\u2019t we talking about Hillary, though?\n\n\u201cThe real collusion scandal, as we\u2019ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,\u201d Sanders said, evoking notable criminal investigator O.J. Simpson (emphasis mine).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence [the election],\u201d Sanders continued.\n\n\n\nHuh.

In Ohio, accomplices to murder can receive the same punishment as the actual killers, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last time she had set foot in her neighborhood was as a teenage girl. On Monday, Patterson was free on parole. Now 41 years old and flanked by television cameras, she held her mother once again for the first time in decades outside their home.\n\n\u201cI am so in love with you, Mama,\u201d she said.\n\nLater, inside the family home, Patterson, brushing a strand of hair from her mother\u2019s face, tearfully told reporters, \u201cTo sit here with my best friend and my mother is the best part of my Christmas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this w3.cdn.anvato.net embed.\n\nPatterson maintained her innocence the entire time she was imprisoned, claiming that Dayton police coerced her into confessing to a robbery she didn\u2019t commit. According to the Daily News, that robbery\u2014over a necklace\u2014opened her up to the aggravated-murder conviction.\n\nNow, thanks to a public campaign for her exoneration that brought in celebrities, politicians and the victim\u2019s own sister, Patterson is free\u2014though not exonerated. In fact, Michelle\u2019s sister, Hollie Lai Holbrook, who was with her when she was killed, may have been the key to Patterson\u2019s freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Dayton Daily News reports, Patterson was one of five people charged for the murder of Michelle and the robbery of Hollie Lai Holbrook and three other girls. According to court records, Michelle\u2019s group had been out \u201crogueing\u201d\u2014stealing from garages\u2014that day when they ran into Patterson\u2019s group, which included Michelle\u2019s killer, LaShawna Keeney.\n\nA Guardian article from 2016 lays out the complexities of the case.\n\nPatterson says that Dayton police forced her to admit that she had robbed a necklace from one of the girls\u2014an act that would make her an active participant in the violent crimes committed against Michelle and her sister and friends. But Patterson never actually did so, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Hollie Lai Holbrook, one of the victims, had claimed that Patterson was innocent as well.\n\nLast year, Lai Holbrook told The Guardian that, when Dayton police arrived at the scene of the crime, she singled out Patterson as someone who had nothing to do with her sister\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cI remember pointing someone out that night and saying to the police: \u2018She didn\u2019t do it, she didn\u2019t have anything to do with it\u2019; that kept going around my head over and over again,\u201d Lai Holbrook told the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who was 18 at the time of her sister\u2019s death, even provided a detailed description of Patterson: \u201cShe was biracial; dark, long hair. I recall she had a coat on, a fluffy coat,\u201d she recalled telling police.\n\nBut police convinced Lai Holbrook to believe that Patterson was involved after telling her that Patterson had confessed to robbing one of the girls.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only way the state failed Patterson. As The Guardian recounts, not only was she forced to make a false admission to law enforcement, but the courts failed her, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nPatterson was inadequately represented at trial, with her defense attorney at the time telling the Guardian that his handling of the case was in his view the lowest point of his career as a lawyer. The defense team dissuaded Patterson from going into the witness box because she \u201cspoke too hood\u201d ... The trial defense team also decided to withhold from the jury a tape recording of a 911 call Patterson made to emergency workers soon after the murder happened. Six of the 12 members of the jury have given affidavits saying that if they had known about the 911 call they would have found her not guilty.\n\nA juror on the case who felt strongly that Patterson was innocent also told the paper that she had \u201ccaved in\u201d to a guilty verdict after being told that it was late and that \u201ca fellow juror was pregnant and needed to go home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Holbrook, who wrote a letter to Ohio Gov. John Kasick last year advocating for Patterson\u2019s exoneration, said that family pressure and trauma led her to bury her doubts about Patterson\u2019s conviction for years.\n\n\u201cI knew I was wrong. But I didn\u2019t want to be the black sheep of the family, the odd one out, and I didn\u2019t want to have to relive that night; I just wanted it buried,\u201d Lai Holbrook admitted to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cWhen the police offered us little hints and pieces of information, it made it easier for me to overlook what really happened that night. The prosecutors were intimidating,\u201d Lai Holbrook added. \u201cNot just to me, to all of us. They were just scary. It seemed like they pushed the fact that all these girls did what they did, and that there was a confession.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Christmas Day, Patterson and her family credited Lai Holbrook with reuniting them at last.\n\n\u201cHolly Lai is a hero, and she has been an advocate for me,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nPatterson, a sixth-grade dropout, will now work for the Ohio Justice and Policy Center in Cincinnati.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do great things,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in prison who are innocent.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Dayton Daily News.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said Tyra Patterson had been exonerated.

Crazy White House press secretary statements were made. It left this reporter curious as to whether there might actually be some truth to what Bannon and the others were saying.

Invited guests included Bannon and the late Roger Ailes, the former chairman and CEO of Fox News.\n\nIt would appear that Bannon spilled the most tea.

Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

He has spent more than 50 Christmases there, but he thought this year might be different. The parole board was set to hear his case for release, but on the day of the hearing, the board delayed it.\n\nIn 1963, when John F. Kennedy was president, a judge sentenced the then 17-year-old Montgomery to life without parole. America is the only place in the world where prosecutors regularly try kids as adults and request that kids be sentenced to die behind bars with no hope of freedom.\n\nBut Montgomery now has a second chance, thanks to a string of rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2012 the Supreme Court recognized that kids are different from adults. They have underdeveloped brains, impairing judgment and impulse control, and are more susceptible to negative influences and peer pressure. Unsurprisingly, those who make their way into the criminal-justice system are often themselves victims (pdf) of physical abuse, sexual abuse, extreme poverty and trauma at elevated levels.\n\nBecause of these differences, the Supreme Court eliminated life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than murder, and severely limited it for kids charged with murder, ruling that only the \u201cirreparably corrupt\u201d can receive a juvenile life-without-parole sentence. And in 2016, in Henry Montgomery\u2019s appeal, the court made that decision retroactive.\n\nMontgomery is now one of the more than 2,100 \u201cjuvenile lifers\u201d in America\u2019s prisons waiting to plead their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the sentence prevails, especially in Michigan\u2014where we\u2019ve all lived and either played sports or coached. While 19 states and the District of Columbia have formally eliminated juvenile life without parole, and while prosecutors in most states almost never seek it, district attorneys in Michigan, Louisiana and a few isolated pockets are leading the charge to keep kids behind bars. Forever.\n\nTake Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit. As of July of 2016 (pdf), Wayne County had more than 150 people with juvenile life-without-parole sentences\u2014the second highest in the country. Ninety percent of those kids are black, even though black people make up just 39 percent of the population. The elected prosecutor, Kym Worthy, has pushed to maintain the original life sentence in nearly 40 percent of cases of juvenile life without parole, even though the Supreme Court has said that only the rare kid should qualify. Jessica Cooper, the elected prosecutor in nearby Oakland County, Mich., is asking for death behind bars in almost 90 percent of the proceedings.\n\nDuring our recent Detroit listen-and-learn tour focused on juvenile justice, several of us heard moving stories about those juvenile lifers who have now been given a second chance. We met Edward Sanders, who at 17 was sentenced to life without parole for participating in a drive-by shooting even though he was not the shooter. His accomplishments behind bars are remarkable. He served on a Michigan committee to help improve relations between prison staff and inmates. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree, took a paralegal course and served as a resident jailhouse lawyer, helping other inmates with their pleadings. He even taught classes. And in July of this year, after more than 40 years in prison, he was resentenced and paroled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are hundreds of people like Sanders who are no longer a danger to society and have something to contribute. Like Sanders, they should be given an opportunity to show they have changed and earn their release.\n\nWhen prosecutors like those in Michigan ask to maintain juvenile life-without-parole sentences, they are saying that people who received lengthy sentences as kids should not have the opportunity to plead their cases to a parole board even after serving decades for their crimes\u2014no matter how changed or how successful they have been in classes or programs. That\u2019s a startling claim to make about a kid who committed a crime before he or she could vote, order a drink, join the military or, for some, drive a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese prosecutors are simply refusing to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. That should change. They should let individuals convicted as children plead their cases to a parole board after spending decades in prison, exercising empathy instead of relying on overly harsh juvenile sentences. State legislators can also pass legislation to end juvenile life without parole. We place trust in our elected officials to follow the law and do the right thing, but they are failing us. We call on our elected leaders to stop betraying the public trust and to end juvenile life without parole forever.\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nStan Van Gundy is head coach of the Detroit Pistons.

Trump being Trump, of course, pointed out during a Q&A session with the media that he made Bannon bend the knee, and added that he doesn\u2019t talk to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the fallout from the book, BBC News notes that Trump has banned cellphones from the West Wing, citing security concerns, which is bullshit\u2014Trump doesn\u2019t want anyone videotaping him beating a puppy to death after being exposed.\n\nIn the hood, when you lose a fight, you run and get an older brother or a cousin to fight for you.

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["russia", "intelligence", "told", "folks", "history", "fbi", "grant", "communities", "fbis", "black", "proof", "russian", "given", "trust", "investigation", "targeting"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

Based upon the facts and recommendations presented to me, I made the decision to place Officer Derick Wiley on indefinite suspension. This is a term used for civil service employees, but it effectively means Officer Wiley\u2019s employment has been terminated.\n\nOur internal investigation revealed that Officer Wiley violated department policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will not be making any additional comments until the Dallas County Grand Jury completes its process.\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note: At approximately 4:21 a.m. ET Saturday, Lyndo Jones was readmitted to the hospital because of serious complications stemming from the shooting. The Root will update you on his condition as details become available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerick Wiley, 35, a 10-year veteran with the Mesquite Police Department in Dallas County, Texas, will face a grand jury on Nov. 28 to determine if he will face criminal charges for the Nov. 8 shooting of Lyndo Jones, 31, Jones\u2019 attorney S. Lee Merritt exclusively shared with The Root.\n\n\n\nWiley is currently on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of two separate investigations into the shooting, one by the Mesquite Police Department and the other by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 8, Jones was sitting inside his vehicle when the car alarm malfunctioned and began blaring. As he struggled to turn it off, someone approached him and asked if he needed assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said that he did not, but that didn\u2019t stop the unidentified person from calling 911 and claiming that Jones was attempting to steal his own vehicle. The 911 call triggered a series of events that ended with Wiley shooting Jones twice in the back even though he was unarmed with his hands raised.\n\nJones was violently searched before being taken into custody and handcuffed to a bed while in critical condition at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was also denied his right to family visitation, according to his legal counsel, criminal defense attorney Justin Moore, who stepped in to represent Jones on behest of civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nMerritt is representing Jones in his civil case against Dallas County and the Mesquite Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Jones was first taken into custody and hospitalized, there were no criminal charges filed against him, which led Moore to investigate why Jones was still technically being held by the Police Department.\n\nDays later, after Moore was forcibly removed from the hospital for insisting that the MPD immediately halt an illegal interrogation of his client, Jones was charged with evading arrest.\n\nAccording to Jones, he requested that his attorney be present for the questioning, but was told by MPD investigators that he didn\u2019t need an attorney because they weren\u2019t there to interrogate him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Brian Parrish, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police Department, insisted during a press conference that questioning Jones without legal counsel present was not in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not being questioned as a suspect but as a \u201cpossible complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my investigators spoke to this individual in the hospital ... it was consensual and it was in reference to him being shot. It was not in reference to any offense he may or may not have committed,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nParrish\u2019s claim runs counter to that of Jones\u2019 attorneys, who were told by guards that Jones would absolutely not be questioned without his lawyers present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed Wiley\u2019s bodycam footage of the shooting, leading District Attorney Faith Johnson to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Jones\u2014on the same day the MPD filed it\u2014and to open a criminal investigation against Wiley.\n\n\n\nJones was finally released on Nov. 15, but according to Parrish, the charge may be revisited.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department claims that Jones \u201cdemonstrated such physical strength that it took three officers just to hold him down until paramedics could arrive at the scene to assess his injuries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that, I\u2019m not an expert on human strength, but I think if someone has been shot and handcuffed and on the ground, and it still takes four large men to hold him down, that might indicate there are other factors in place,\u201d Parrish told local station CBS-DFW.\n\nNot content to play games with the Mesquite Police Department, Merritt, who is representing Jones in his civil case against the MPD, unapologetically admits that his client was high on marijuana and cocaine while sitting in his parked vehicle. Still, he makes it clear that his being high should not give police officers license to shoot unarmed people who are minding their own business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe romanticized search for the perfect victim is futile and dangerous,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cMy client was doing absolutely nothing that warranted this police officer opening fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pre-emptive, transparent vilification of innocent people play out time and time again,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cLyndo Jones is a hardworking father of two young daughters who was profiled by a stranger and shot by Officer Wiley for no reason at all. Wiley is the violent perpetrator here, not my client.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, the Nov. 28 grand jury hearing means nothing in and of itself. What matters, he says, is that Wiley will be charged and convicted of a crime that was not only a willful abuse of his state-sanctioned power but also emblematic of the violence that infests police departments across the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe district attorney [Faith Johnson] has not issued criminal charges against the officer who shot Lyndo Jones twice in the back with his hands up despite abundant probable cause,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cOnly 1 percent of law-enforcement misconduct is prosecuted in the state of Texas. That is by design.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who also represents the family of Jordan Edwards, the 15-year-old boy fatally shot by Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver, says that the grand jury process is tainted and shrouded in secrecy, and only through exposing that truth is reform possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOliver was fired from his job and charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault by a public servant\u2014one charge for each of the young boys in the car with Jordan, including two of his brothers.\n\nThe charges alone against a police officer in Texas are extremely rare, but that is no cause for celebration. There has been no trial, yet; subsequently, there has been no conviction\u2014even though Oliver executed a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecutors make unique exceptions when dealing with police involved malfeasance,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nIn Jones\u2019 case, Wiley\u2019s bodycam allegedly captured the entire incident, and his attorneys are openly encouraging the MPD to release the footage.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the video is highly incriminating against the police officer and my client, and I urge the Mesquite Police Department to be transparent and release it immediately,\u201d Merritt told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious organizations have formed the Coalition for Justice for Lyndo Jones, including Mothers Against Police Brutality, the American Black Cross, the Texas Organizing Project, Friendship-West Baptist Church, the Arlington chapter of the NAACP, the Dallas chapter of the NAACP, Faith-Forward Dallas and Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\n\nClick here to donate to the YouCaring fund established for Jones to assist with medical and legal expenses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to sign the petition urging the Dallas County DA\u2019s Office to issue an arrest warrant for Mesquite Police Officer Derick Wiley.", "keywords": ["told", "shooting", "lyndo", "department", "jones", "face", "jury", "dallas", "fired", "merritt", "wiley", "attorney", "grand", "officer", "mesquite", "texas"], "polarity": 0.04906768837803321, "subjectivity": 0.4688305053822294},

Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn\u2019t represent my base\u2014he\u2019s only in it for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so they are both delusional. Your president sounds completely unhinged and ridiculous. But wait. There\u2019s more:\n\nSteve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.\n\nThis is the part where we all collectively shake our heads and remind Trump that he wasn\u2019t saying all of this while he and Bannon were in bed together. He wasn\u2019t saying all of this when Bannon was helping him get the \u201calt-right\u201d vote.

In 1991, when Tharpe was convicted, every juror voted for him to be put to death. If one of those jurors had objected, Tharpe would be serving life in prison. Instead, he is going to die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarney Gattie, who was supposed to be one of those impartial jurors, is a virulent racist. There were probably others, but there is no doubt about Gattie. Lawyers, appellate court judges and even Keith Tharpe know it, but Tharpe is going to be executed anyway.\n\nAccording to Time, lawyers seeking an appeal for Tharpe interviewed Gattie and the rest of the jurors in 1998. Here are some of the things Gattie said:\n\n\n\nThere is a difference between \u201cgood black folks\u201d like the victims Tharpe murdered and \u201cniggers.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe owned a store and routinely kicked \u201cniggers\u201d out of his store.\n\n\n\nHe voted for the death penalty because he thinks Tharpe is a \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Nicole Brown Simpson hadn\u2019t married a \u201cnigger\u201d (O.J.

But insiders know there is one part of America\u2019s legal system that has an outsized influence on convictions, sentencing and incarceration:\n\nLocal prosecutors.\n\nHere are a few facts that bear witness to the oft-forgotten power of local prosecutors:\n\nBureau of Justice Statistics (pdf) data shows that 87 percent of all U.S. inmates are housed in state prisons.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, crime and arrests dropped, but incarceration rates rose because prosecutors filed more felony cases.\n\nIf President Donald Trump pardoned every single person in federal prison tomorrow, the number of people incarcerated would only drop from 2.1 million to 1.9 million.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the local prosecutors who drive mass incarceration, and it is the local prosecutors who can end it.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in Philadelphia decided to do something about it when they selected Larry Krasner to be district attorney with nearly 75 percent of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a stunning victory by a man known for taking on civil rights cases and suing the Philadelphia Police Department. Krasner ran on a platform of criminal-justice reform and ending mass incarceration that inspired local activists and made others call him \u201cunelectable.\u201d\n\nBut he is just a prosecutor, not a judge or a legislator, right? What could he do?\n\nKrasner has decided to use his prosecutorial discretion in unprecedented ways. He promised to never ask for cash bail for a nonviolent offender, which is perfectly legal and up to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Cash bail has long been derided as a for-profit system that penalizes poor people before they are convicted of a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrasner also vowed to curb police corruption by prosecuting cops with as much zeal as the criminal-justice system targets others. His platform states that he will not prosecute cases where the police are abusive, and the new DA also vowed that he will end the illegal stop-and-frisk program by \u201crefusing to bring to trial cases stemming from illegal frisks and searches.\u201d\n\nThe new prosecutor says that he will no longer seek the death penalty; nor will he seize any defendant\u2019s assets until after a conviction has been made. Krasner also plans to steer cases of drug possession and nonviolent offenses toward treatment programs, and he says that he will seek to end the drug war by treating drug use as a medical problem.\n\nCould this work? Many people think so. It has been done before. Harris County, Texas, instituted a no-cash bail system that freed dozens of low-level nonviolent people who were in jail just because they couldn\u2019t afford to pay their way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014 the district attorney representing Brooklyn, N.Y., decided that he wouldn\u2019t pursue low-level marijuana arrests. Florida prosecutor Aramis Ayala announced that she would stop seeking the death penalty earlier this year, and Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped more than 100 cases after police officers seemingly falsified evidence.\n\nNationwide, more than 90 percent of all criminal convictions are determined by negotiations with prosecutors that result in plea agreements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the thought of an orange totalitarian sleeping in the White House upsets you, when it comes to ending mass incarcerations in your state and community, it is still important to know:\n\nYour vote counts.", "keywords": ["incarceration", "prosecutor", "local", "proved", "prosecutors", "voting", "cases", "nonviolent", "residents", "end", "philly", "mass", "system", "help", "krasner"], "polarity": 0.10910845910845912, "subjectivity": 0.4042997542997543},

I was in the Post newsroom when Jayson Blair was pushing out fake pieces for the New York Times about the Washington, D.C., sniper, and Post brass were going nuts believing that an out-of-town reporter was beating them in their own backyard.\n\nIt was Post reporters and editors who steadied the ship and assured the higher-ups that the stories Blair was producing weren\u2019t where their reporting was leading them. Those reporters and editors worked long hours, stayed later and came in on days off to make sure that everything put into print was right.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has been tireless in his attack on the media. He\u2019s called the media and the stories they\u2019ve produced \u201cfake media\u201d and claimed to be \u201cfailing\u201d any news outlet that pens a piece he doesn\u2019t find flattering about him or his administration. I can\u2019t speak for all journalists, but I can say that the people I know at the Washington Post and the institution itself don\u2019t take kindly to this presidential bashing of who they are and what they represent. To date, the Post is the only newspaper in the country that has taken down a president, and I can assure you that those reporters covering the White House would love nothing more than to do it again.\n\nLate Thursday, the Post released a scathing report that not only are Trump and his team trying to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, but they are also literally Googling for whom Trump can issue pardons and how.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how The Root got this photo, but we have actual footage of Trump Googling \u201cpardons\u201d:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post story notes that Mueller is looking deep into the Russia rabbit hole and wants all of it: Trump\u2019s taxes, Trump\u2019s business associates, his dealings with and in Russia. He wants to lay to rest the claims that Trump and/or members of his Cabinet colluded with Russia. The obvious question here is, if Trump has nothing to hide, then why is he so bothered by Mueller\u2019s investigation?\n\nThose of us who didn\u2019t vote for this large orange mass of hate know the answer in full: Trump and Russia are fucking! Like a spouse who\u2019s been cheated on, non-Trump Americans know full well when something doesn\u2019t smell right. We know that when Trump started staying late after work and trying to lose weight, he was dating Russia. We know that when Trump got a second credit card that didn\u2019t have our name on it, he was meeting Russia at a hotel downtown. We know what cheating looks like.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: Trump has brought this on himself with his boisterous tweets and his \u201cI don\u2019t have a care\u201d attitude. The walls are closing in on this wasted administration, and hopefully we can get this marriage annulled because we haven\u2019t been together that long.

In 2016 a Supreme Court decision made the 2012 ruling apply retroactively, yet the state of Louisiana continues to push back and fight against giving juvenile offenders an opportunity at parole.\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that according to the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights, prosecutors in the state are trying to block too many juvenile murderers from having a chance at parole\u2014which means the state may not be in compliance with the high court ruling.\n\nLouisiana district attorneys have tried to block, or have already successfully blocked, about one-third of the juvenile murderers who meet the state\u2019s requirement of having served 25 years and completed educational programming to qualify for parole.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, only juveniles who are considered \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d and incapable of being rehabilitated should be sentenced to life without parole\u2014and those should be rare cases. Based on that, Jill Pasquarella\u2014who is an attorney for the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights\u2014told Nola.com that it is unreasonable to think a third of all juvenile lifers in the state would meet the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d\n\nBecause prosecutors have challenged the parole eligibility of so many juvenile lifers, Pasquarella said that the state will be headed back to court\u2014which will cost the already cash-strapped state hundreds of thousands of more dollars. In addition to the cost of funding a second defense of the state law, in some cases, the state will have to pay the lawyers that represent the juvenile lifers in these cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete Adams is the executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, and he acknowledges that the state is probably headed back to court, but he says the Supreme Court needs to add more clarity to what \u201cworst of the worst\u201d means with regards to juvenile lifers.\n\n\u201cEventually the U.S. Supreme Court will say what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not,\u201d Adams told Nola.com. \u201cIf the U.S. Supreme Court says no one can get life without parole or who can\u2019t get it, we will abide by that.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, when the Supreme Court did make its ruling in 2012, Louisiana answered that by creating a law that only gave access to parole to juvenile lifers who had been sentenced after 2012\u2014not those who were already in prison at that time. A juvenile lifer challenged the Louisiana law, and in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the state clarification and said it needed to give juvenile lifers who were already locked up a chance at parole as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to that, during the 2017 legislative session, the Louisiana law was rewritten so that beginning this month (November), juvenile lifers who have served 25 years and meet other requirements, such as obtaining a high school diploma equivalent, would have a shot at parole. The new law leaves room for prosecutors to challenge any juvenile lifer\u2019s access to parole through a special hearing.\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, run by Leon Cannizzarro, has reviewed the cases of 64 juveniles serving life for murder\u2014more than any other district attorney in the state. The office has filed motions to block 32 of those cases from parole eligibility.\n\nThose 32 cases count in the number that makes up the one-third of the total cases in the state in which the Louisiana Center for Children\u2019s Rights says state prosecutors are seeking to challenge parole access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Dan Claitor (R-Baton Rouge)\u2014who sponsored this year\u2019s revised juvenile lifer legislation\u2014conceded that the state\u2019s numbers don\u2019t look good when it comes to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cI would have to agree\u2014if those numbers are correct\u2014it probably does not fit within the rails of what the Supreme Court has said,\u201d Claitor said. \u201cI just think it is a little premature until we have good solid numbers out there.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.", "keywords": ["law", "lifers", "district", "la", "seeking", "parole", "court", "ruling", "despite", "worst", "cases", "juvenile", "state", "working", "supreme", "louisiana"], "polarity": -0.08184300993124521, "subjectivity": 0.45011713776419665},

In preparation, the university and the city of Berkeley are deploying a number of strategies, from counseling to pepper spray, to keep the event from spiraling into another violent confrontation.\n\nThe birthplace of the free speech movement, Berkeley\u2019s campus has become a battleground this year for showdowns between the radical right and anti-fascists\u2014the most violent confrontation of which happened in February at a protest against a planned speech by conservative media troll Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nThese violent clashes have made the campus particularly attractive to far-right speakers and demonstrators looking to draw attention and stir up the famously liberal community.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, law enforcement will be out in force Thursday night, and Police Chief Andrew Greenwood promised \u201cvery strong, rapid arrests\u201d if protesters show up with weapons or masks. The campus is also shutting down early in anticipation of Shapiro\u2019s speech, and concrete blockades will be erected around the campus.\n\nEarlier this week, the City Council also voted to allow police to use pepper spray on violent protesters\u2014reversing, in part, a ban that had been in place since 1997, according to The Hill.

People can twist statistics to fit any narrative. When debating race, some skeptics (usually white people, racists and black men with no facial hair) are willing to easily dismiss your assertions if you don\u2019t have peer-reviewed, scientific proof. Pulling out data from a study during a debate about racial injustice is like licking the big joker and sticking it to your forehead.\n\nNot only are there disparities in arrests, prosecution, sentencing and incarceration between blacks and whites, but a new study has revealed that even when defendants are willing to plead guilty to a crime, prosecutors will still offer black defendants much harsher plea deals than their white counterparts.\n\nCarlos Berdej\u00f3, a researcher at Loyola University, recently completed a study entitled \u201cCriminalizing Race: Racial Disparities in Plea Bargaining\u201d (pdf), which highlights the racial disparities in the criminal-justice system by examining the differences in the way prosecutors handle misdemeanor crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not the felonies that often saddle black and brown people with criminal records, fines and jail sentences. Law-enforcement officers and prosecutors charge defendants with misdemeanor crimes more often, and these charges receive less focus because of a number of factors, including the severity of the alleged offense, the salaciousness of the details and the lack of public outcry.\n\nBerdej\u00f3 looked at misdemeanor crimes in Wisconsin. He focused on the state because of the wealth of detailed information that state includes in its data, including the race, gender, age and criminal history of the defendant. Wisconsin also has a plea bargaining process that is not guided by mandatory maximums or minimums, which means that the sentences and punishment are almost always left up to the discretion of prosecutors and judges.\n\nHe examined 30,807 cases over a seven-year period and found a number of disturbing facts, in almost every phase of the criminal-justice system. The study determined biases in arrests, sentencing and the types of plea deals that were offered, and it found several, including these:\n\nWhite people facing misdemeanor charges were more than 74 percent more likely than black people to have all charges carrying potential prison time dropped, dismissed or reduced.\n\n\n\nWhite people with no criminal history were more than 25 percent more likely to have charges reduced than black people who also had no criminal history.\n\n\n\nBlack defendants were 19.38 percentage points more likely than white defendants to be incarcerated.\n\n\n\nBlack offenders, on average, received sentences 1.23 months longer than those given to whites.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is the plea bargaining process that exposes the differences in the way the justice system criminalizes blacks suspected of committing crimes. The data shows that whites were 74.9 percent more likely to see the magnitude of their misdemeanor crimes lessened, and 25 percent more likely than blacks to have their misdemeanor charges reduced, dropped or amended.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut aren\u2019t blacks more crime prone? That\u2019s probably why they get harsher penalties.\u201d\n\nNot according to Berdej\u00f3\u2019s research. In the cases where the defendant had no prior convictions, white defendants were 46 percent more likely to have their charges reduced or erased than \u201cthe blacks.\u201d The statistics hold true even when researchers controlled for the type of crime, the quality of the attorney and the experience of the prosecutor. In other words, when Berdej\u00f3 examined every variable that could explain the racism in the criminal-justice system, blacks still received harsher sentences and got worse deals than whites when they pleaded guilty to crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of this study are consequential for three reasons:\n\nProsecutorial discretion: Wisconsin law allows prosecutors and judges to determine plea bargains and deals. The research shows that when they\u2019re given the latitude, the actors inside the criminal-justice system will always produce racially biased results.\n\nEconomic impact: The fines and penalties associated with these crimes affect entire communities. The inability to pay could land you in jail. It means that black families are more likely to lose a potential earner because black parents are incarcerated more often and longer than whites. Furthermore, convictions for misdemeanors and felonies affect the ability to get financial aid for education, employment opportunities and earning potential. The criminalization of African Americans: The study shows that black people are more likely to be arrested for committing the same crimes. Blacks receive longer prison sentences. Blacks get their charges dropped or reduced less often. All of these facts show how blacks are criminalized and viewed as more dangerous, even when the pool with which they are compared consists of white criminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure none of this comes as a surprise to anyone reading this, but the next time some \u201calt-right\u201d-leaning fart bubble starts explaining how blacks make up so much of the prison population, commit so many crimes or don\u2019t work, or presents some other insidious stereotype that is selectively remembered by your I\u2019m-not-racist-I\u2019m-just-looking-at-the-facts friend, slam this study on the table and remind that person that whiteness is, and will always be, America\u2019s trump card.\n\nRead the entire study here (pdf).", "keywords": ["white", "told", "phase", "defendants", "reveals", "favors", "criminaljustice", "likely", "plea", "blacks", "black", "misdemeanor", "yall", "crimes", "charges", "system", "whites", "study"], "polarity": 0.07264019505398815, "subjectivity": 0.47224254034598856},

Last night, President Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist gave his first televised interview to 60 Minutes. The main takeaway from Bannon\u2019s often contentious exchanges with interviewer Charlie Rose is something most of us had long concluded: Bannon takes himself incredibly seriously. An overly caffeinated man in love with his own legend may make for an interesting interview, but unfortunately, Bannon is not nearly as enchanting a political figure as he thinks he is.\n\n\n\nEver since Bannon stepped in as the Trump campaign\u2019s CEO (what that means is still unclear), he has been sold to the masses as some sort of political Svengali. Bannon clearly buys into his own mythology, describing himself as a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d working toward an economic populism and someone dedicated to eradicating our present political system, which has long been marred by elites with endless cash flow driving the interests of both major American political parties. Of course, this is a crock of shit, but let\u2019s pretend for a few before we gnaw through Bannon\u2019s brand of nonsense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Bannon, \u201cThe Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election.\u201d Why? \u201cThey do not want Donald Trump\u2019s populist, economic, nationalist agenda implemented.\u201d When confronted about who exactly he meant, Bannon was direct, immediately naming Mitch McConnell and, \u201cto a degree,\u201d Paul Ryan. Bannon claims that near the end of McConnell\u2019s first meeting with the then-president-elect at Trump Tower, the Senate majority leader said, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear anymore \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 talk.\u201d\n\nAs for the swamp, Bannon notes that it\u2019s been 50 years in the making and is a successful business model that cannot be eliminated in two terms. Instead, Bannon argues, it will take 20 years to topple it, and that\u2019s only after folks relentlessly go after it. Bannon did acknowledge that the \u201coriginal sin of the administration\u201d was to embrace the very Republican establishment both Bannon and Sweet Potato Saddam claim to loathe.\n\n\n\nYet 45 did so working under the realization, \u201cI need to govern.\u201d We see how well that\u2019s gone thus far. As for the GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, Bannon said it was Speaker of the House Ryan who promised a repeal-and-replace deal on 45\u2019s desk by Easter. After that, it would be tax reform by August and, by December, an infrastructure bill. However, Bannon now realizes of our current health care system, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to totally repeal it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpoiler: None of those other things are going to happen, either.\n\n\n\nStill, when it comes to the failures of this administration, Bannon chided Rose by claiming, \u201cYou\u2019re holding him to an unfair standard.\u201d Much like 45, Bannon greets failure by immediately pointing in everyone else\u2019s direction. It\u2019s not their fault; it\u2019s Republican leadership\u2019s fault; it\u2019s the system at large\u2019s fault; it is the media\u2019s fault; it\u2019s the fault of every other person and any other entity one can think of but theirs.\n\nThe only subject in which Bannon admitted fault was the firing of FBI head James Comey. Bannon would not single out Jared Kushner directly, but he did say just enough to make it apparent it was Kushner\u2019s thinking that led to what Bannon considers the \u201cworst mistake in modern political history.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat aside, the rest of Bannon\u2019s shots were direct. On those Republicans who criticize 45\u2019s national security strategy:\n\nThat\u2019s the geniuses of the Bush administration. I hold these people in contempt, total and complete contempt ... They\u2019re idiots, and they\u2019ve gotten us in this situation, and they question a good man like Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nBannon specifically named Condoleezza Rice, Brent Scowcroft and Colin Powell.\n\nCounterpoint:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Politico reported that 45 decided to first interview Rex Tillerson for the secretary of state job at the recommendation of Rice and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. I\u2019m sure none of them would recommend toying with nuclear war by way of Twitter. Speaking of Twitter, Bannon still fancies how 45 uses it. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s speaking directly to the people who put him in office when he uses Twitter,\u201d Bannon claims. \u201c[Chief of staff John Kelly\u2019s] not going to be able to control it, either, because it\u2019s Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBannon also took shots at those who still remain in the administration\u2014including Gary Cohn. Cohn, who is Jewish, did not care for the way 45 handled the events in Charlottesville, Va., and the way he supported neo-Nazis and white supremacists. To Bannon, though, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to break, resign.\u201d\n\nWhen it was time for one of Bannon\u2019s favorite topics\u2014immigration\u2014he responded as expected. Though he claims to be worried about the Republicans losing the House over 45\u2019s handling of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Bannon is clear on how this ought to go: \u201cAs the work permits end, they have to self-deport. No path to citizenship. No path to green card. No amnesty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen confronted about immigration and its history in America, Bannon chided Rose once again, calling the notion that \u201ceveryone is an immigrant except for Native Americans\u201d a \u201cleftist\u201d approach. \u201cCharlie, that\u2019s beneath you,\u201d Bannon claimed.\n\nBannon, a Catholic, then disavowed his own church for its pro-DACA, pro-immigration stance when asked about it, arguing that the church only operates from that space because immigrants fill the pews as Americans turn their backs on the church, given its mishandling of child-molestation charges at the hands of priests for decades.\n\nBannon believes \u201ceconomic nationalism is what this country was built on,\u201d and that includes \u201cnationality, every race, every sexual orientation\u201d because \u201cas long as you are an American citizen, you are a part of this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bannon\u2019s own charges of racism, he said, \u201cI was raised in a desegregated neighborhood.\u201d Funny\u2014he didn\u2019t even bother pretending to have black friends, going instead with the notion that living around a few of \u201cthe blacks\u201d is enough to squash accusations of racism. Bannon barked that he will not be lectured by \u201climousine liberals,\u201d which is quite the interesting retort from a man who worked in Hollywood and for Goldman Sachs. And naturally, he described the Russian investigation as a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs for this colorblind economic nationalism, Bannon\u2019s is just business-class bigotry. He may not want to expel nonwhites from the country, but he does want us all to fall in line with his way of thinking. Tolerating people under rigid terms does not make one without prejudice; it merely gussies up a bit, like spraying Febreze over a dirty shirt instead of simply washing it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a bonus clip that aired online, Bannon had the nerve to describe Hillary Clinton as \u201cnot very bright.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe problem with Bannon is that he continues to operate under the unfortunate perception that he and the candidate he worked for are special. While it\u2019s true enough that they are anomalies in that they are novices who managed to get to the White House on their first real try, much of that has to do with working within the parameters of the very system they claim to be so against. Republicans have spent decades paving the way for their current critical-thinking-challenged head of the party. Likewise, while Bannon bemoans K Street lobbyists and the like, he is largely funded by the billionaire Mercer family.\n\nOne wonders why Bannon was not asked directly about the Mercer family. After all, they fund his site and have poured a whole lot of money into various political candidates\u2014including the current president, who only hired Bannon after Rebekah Mercer reportedly \u201cpushed\u201d him to. Both 45 and Bannon are mediocre white men magnified by institutional racism and the wealth of billionaires who fund their foolishness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the entire interview, all I could hear was former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s infamous New Yorker interview in which he pronounced:\n\nI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock. I\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Bannon\u2019s interview was like watching someone masturbate. It was watching a fake-ass Archie Bunker do a drag act of a more competent and more accomplished political thinker. Much like Issa Rae on Insecure, I couldn\u2019t wait to grab a towel and wash that shit off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP.S. A photographer claims that CBS intentionally tried to make Bannon look bad on camera. Bannon\u2019s ugly\u2014inside and out\u2014should all be attributed to the man himself. He looks like a cold sore on a ghost, and that has absolutely nothing to do with CBS.

President Molten Lava Face had one of his friends from Fake News Fox News over to the White House to feather him with only the softest of questions, but from that interview\u2014which was shot Thursday and aired Friday morning\u2014I was able to ascertain two things: Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating the president\u2019s campaign ties to Russia, is on the chopping block, and the president lied about having tapes of his and former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s private conversations because he\u2019s a lying-ass liar.\n\n\n\nWhen asked by Ainsley Earhardt, a favorite of the Trump White House and a co-host of Fox & Friends, whether Mueller should recuse himself from the investigation, the Washington Post notes that Trump said three times, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d Trump also stated that he isn\u2019t fond of Comey\u2019s friendship with Mueller, calling the relationship \u201cvery bothersome\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cThe people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters. Some of them worked for Hillary Clinton. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous, if you want to know the truth, from that standpoint.\u201d\n\nBecause Trump runs the White House like a dictator, he doesn\u2019t believe this it\u2019s possible for someone who has opposing political beliefs to conduct an impartial investigation. He hasn\u2019t liked Mueller since he was chosen to lead the deep dive into TrumPutin\u2019s obvious Russia connections, and has been vocal about it.\n\nAccording to the Post, Trump has talked with advisers and friends about the possibility of firing Mueller, but TrumPutin did at least know how to sound diplomatic during his interview, which aired Friday, when he stated, \u201cRobert Mueller is an honorable man, and hopefully he\u2019ll come up with an honorable solution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also took a moment to declare his innocence, because of course he would.\n\n\u201cLook, there has been no obstruction,\u201d Trump told Fox. \u201cThere has been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey. But that\u2019s been no collusion, no obstruction\u2014and virtually everybody agrees to that.\u201d\n\nAnd he also expressed a fool\u2019s belief that his Senate remix of his shitty health care bill would find some love in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have four very good people that\u2014it\u2019s not that they\u2019re opposed; they\u2019d like to get certain changes,\u201d Trump said about his friendly GOP senators. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see if we can take care of that.\u201d\n\nTrumPutin did come close to acknowledging that his health care bill screws the poor. He noted that health care is \u201ca very complicated situation from the standpoint, you do something that\u2019s good for one group but bad for another.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s funny because the whole idea of there being tapes of TrumPutin\u2019s private conversations with Comey came from Trump. After five-and-a-half weeks of allowing the public, Congress, God and everyone else to believe that their conversations might have been recorded, TrumPutin readily admitted that there were no tapes. But the real piece of work here is how Trumpelstiltskin is trying to spin this yarn into gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any tape, and I didn\u2019t tape. But when he found out that I, you know, that there may be tapes out there, whether it\u2019s government tapes or anything else, and who knows, I think his story may have changed. I mean, you\u2019ll have to take a look at that, because then he has to tell what actually took place at the events.\u201d\n\nTrump continued: \u201cMy story didn\u2019t change. My story was always a straight story. My story was always the truth.

The measure would strike the death penalty from being considered as a sentencing option for aggravated murder. If the bill passes, the harshest sentence in the state would instead be life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Statehouse, which has a two-person Democratic majority.\n\nThanks to Gov. Jay Inslee, there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington since 2014.\n\nLawmakers cited the cost of maintaining the death penalty and incidences of wrongful convictions as reasons to abolish capital punishment. According to the Times, one Seattle University study from 2015 found that death-penalty cases in Washington \u201ccost $1 million more than similar cases where capital punishment [was] not sought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the co-sponsors of the bill, state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, said the vote was a reflection of the public\u2019s evolution on capital punishment.\n\n\u201cYou cannot read a front-page story about DNA mistakes that has someone in jail for 35 years and not be jolted to the core,\u201d Carlyle said, according to the Times. \u201cThat has transformed the public\u2019s view of this issue.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, as in other parts of the country, capital punishment disproportionately affects black defendants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne 2015 study found that jurors in Washington state were three times more likely to recommend a death sentence for a black defendant than a white one\u2014despite the fact that prosecutors were slightly more likely to seek the death penalty against white defendants. This unequal application of the punishment was among the reasons Gov. Inslee instilled the moratorium.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nIn a written statement issued after the vote, Inslee said that when he enacted the moratorium, \u201cI hoped it would create space for a discussion about the unequal application of this law, the enormous costs of seeking this punishment and the uncertainty of closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d \u201cI hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the bill passes in the Statehouse, Washington will join 19 other states and the District of Columbia in ridding themselves of the death penalty. Three other states aside from Washington\u2014Oregon, Colorado and Pennsylvania\u2014currently have moratoriums on the practice.\n\n", "keywords": ["death", "crucial", "times", "inslee", "step", "abolishing", "punishment", "bill", "states", "penalty", "state", "capital", "takes", "washington"], "polarity": 0.08377192982456139, "subjectivity": 0.4065789473684211},

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\n\u201cWe felt that this was an issue over the last months, as we have continued to work with our players on issues of equality and on issues of criminal-justice reform, that was surfaced for us, and we thought it was appropriate to lend our support to it,\u201d Lockhart told reporters, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut it\u2019s the timing of the endorsement that\u2019s most striking. The league is still desperately trying to move past the controversy surrounding player protests against racial injustice and police brutality during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NFL\u2019s action also comes just a day after news broke that former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick is filing a grievance against the NFL\u2019s owners for collusion.\n\nKaepernick is widely (and justly) credited for bringing social and racial issues to the fore when he began sitting\u2014then taking a knee\u2014during the national anthem. Since then, other players have taken up Kaepernick\u2019s mantle, both on and off the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhiladelphia Eagle Malcolm Jenkins, former Baltimore Raven Anquan Boldin and Detroit Lion Glover Quin have all spoken to Congress on the issue of police and criminal-justice reform within the past year.\n\nIt\u2019s only now, with the endorsement of the Grassley-Durbin bill, that the league itself has decided to take any action.\n\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t taken any position on the bill, though it directly contradicts Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 instructions to federal prosecutors earlier this year that they pursue maximum sentences for drug offenses. In fact, despite having broad bipartisan support, the Grassley-Durbin bill has failed to reach the Senate floor. Key Senate Republicans, along with the Klu Klux Keebler himself, have opposed the bill, and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring the measure to the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what impact the league\u2019s endorsement could have on the bill\u2019s passage, but the timing raises questions, to say the least. While individual players have called for criminal-justice and police reform, the Post reports that the league has only recently gotten involved with the legislation:\n\nBut a spokesman for Grassley added that the NFL had not coordinated with the bill\u2019s congressional sponsors in advance of its decision. In the meantime, no other sports league has signed on. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association did not immediately return a call for comment about whether the football players\u2019 union would also endorse the bill.\ufeff\n\n\n\nThe NFL\u2019s endorsement and its timing rings of other PR-oriented moves the league has made in response to a crisis. After video circulated of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice clocking his then-fiancee in the face, the league doubled down on punishments for players accused of domestic violence. It also kicked off a public-service campaign, \u201cSay No More.\u201d What it didn\u2019t do was actually punish its players (I\u2019m looking at you, Jerry Jones).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Grassley-Durbin bill is a much-needed step toward reforming the criminal-justice system. Whether the NFL\u2019s endorsement means anything in terms of pushing the bill through remains to be seen, but supporters of Kaepernick and the NFL players\u2019 protest are right to feel conflicted. Supporting the bill is the right thing to do; the league\u2019s motivations for this foray onto Capitol Hill are dubious, to say the least.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["league", "endorsement", "curious", "nfl", "criminaljustice", "bill", "criminaljusticereform", "case", "nfls", "timing", "sentences", "players", "spokesman"], "polarity": 0.0073683261183261186, "subjectivity": 0.37760191197691206},

We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be the story they\u2019re telling, but it sounds like yet another little white lie from a White House full of white nationalists and white supremacists. Bannon may indeed have handed in his resignation and is leaving just about one year from the day he joined Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s presidential campaign, but like most things surrounding his tenure in the White House, his leaving reeks of acrimony.\n\nDays ago, the failing New York Times reported that Rupert Murdoch tried to convince President Trump to fire Bannon and received very little pushback from the newfound Confederate cheerleader:\n\nAt a recent dinner at the White House with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Kelly, before Mr. Trump decamped for a working vacation at his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., the president listened while one of the guests, Mr. Murdoch, a founder of Fox News, said Mr. Bannon had to go. Mr. Trump offered little pushback, according to a person familiar with the conversation, and vented his frustrations about Mr. Bannon. Mr. Murdoch is close to Mr. Kushner, who has been in open warfare with Mr. Bannon since the spring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Politico noted that the new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was looking around at White House staff trying to figure out everyone\u2019s purpose\u2014particularly Bannon\u2019s:\n\n\n\nThe role of chief strategist Steve Bannon has come under particular scrutiny in several conversations, particularly because he has a large staff, including an outside public relations expert, but no specific duties.\n\nAnd days later, the Daily Beast claimed that Bannon\u2019s enemies found a friend in Kelly:\n\n\n\nKelly, in his various conversations with other White House aides, has heard from at least three White House officials that \u201cBannon is a problem,\u201d according to one Bannon colleague. Some Trump officials have been quick to blame Bannon for ongoing tensions, which often stem from heated, vocal ideological disagreements between Bannon and his fellow Trump advisers. Those same officials are all-but-openly hoping that Kelly brings the axe down on Bannon in the coming weeks, if not sooner. \u201c[Kelly] has made it clear to everyone he\u2026 wants an end to the drama,\u201d one senior Trump administration official told The Daily Beast, describing Kelly\u2019s desire for reining in Trump\u2019s staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough many thought the events that took place in Charlottesville, Va., and the horrific comments Tropicana Jong Il made in response to them would be just enough to finally get ol\u2019 white-nationalist-loving Bannon out of the White House, most know better. It wasn\u2019t the racism that got Bannon the axe; it was Bannon getting far too much attention. It was Bannon getting all the kudos for 45\u2019s election win\u2014specifically Bloomberg reporter Joshua Green\u2019s book, Devil\u2019s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency.\n\nBannon\u2019s case was likely not helped by the interview he gave to the progressive-leaning publication the American Prospect, where he sounded like he was actually president of the United States of America. Habanero Hitler was already vexing over that Time cover featuring Bannon and those Saturday Night Live skits portraying Bannon as the the Barney to his Baby Bop, the Bell Biv to his DeVoe and the Swae Lee to that other one in Rae Sremmurd.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why Sunny D Zedong is mad at Bannon, and that\u2019s why Bannon is out.\n\n\n\nFor those thinking that Bannon\u2019s exit\u2014after he reportedly consistently leaked info about his White House adversaries like Boy Wonder Jared and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster\u2014will suddenly bring a nice glass of chill to the Bankruptcy Batista administration, hardy har, bitch. Hardy har. Honeysuckle Lenin is a lunatic and no staff member will be able to contain him. The same goes for his racism, since both Bannon and Tangerine Mussolini are their own respective racism monuments.\n\nNo, all of the chaos that has taken place since January will continue. What will likely change, though, is the \u201calt-right,\u201d which is 2017 lingo for \u201cracist sum\u2019bitch with internet access,\u201d whispering sweet nothings to Minute Maid Mao. Kelly may think Bannon\u2019s departure will end the drama, but Bannon is about to reconnect with the old gang at Breitbart and bring the pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a Breitbart editor who tweeted this minutes after the news broke. This dude is not singing Edwin Starr; he\u2019s speaking on behalf of the bigot who gets Seinfeld checks.\n\n\n\nAxios has also reported:\n\nBannon has felt liberated since it became clear he was being pushed out, according to friends. He\u2019s told associates he has a \u201ckilling machine\u201d in Breitbart News, and it\u2019s possible he returns to lead their editorial operation.\n\n\n\nA source familiar with Breitbart\u2019s operations told me they would go \u201cthermonuclear\u201d against \u201cglobalists\u201d that Bannon and his friends believe are ruining the Trump administration, and by extension, America.\n\n\n\nWatch for Breitbart\u2019s Washington Editor Matt Boyle to be a central figure in this war \u2014 which has already begun \u2014 against White House officials like HR McMaster, Dina Powell, Gary Cohn, and Jared and Ivanka.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd one former aide echoed this to Bloomberg:\n\nEven if he continues to support the president, he may become aggressive in attacking the administration\u2019s more traditional Republican players and policies. He has ample access to funding through his close relationships with conservative billionaire Bob Mercer and other major Republican donors. Kurt Bardella, a Republican communications specialist who worked for Bannon at Breitbart but later denounced him, predicted the departing strategist would \u201cfeel liberated\u201d by his departure. \u201cNow, he will be able to operate openly and freely to inflict as much damage as he possibly can on the \u2019globalists\u2019 that remain in the Trump Administration,\u201d Bardella said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also claim that Sebastian Gorka, a Bannon ally and another white nationalist sympathizer, may be on the chopping block, too. I hope they fire him by the end of this sentence so it will make Bannon even madder. I doubt that White Walker Stephen Miller goes, but hopefully he gets his somehow, too.\n\n\n\nSteve Bannon is much like y\u2019all\u2019s president. He\u2019s racist, he\u2019s pompous to the point that he might suck his own cock, as one former White House communications director might argue, and he loves attention. The only key difference between the two is that Bannon isn\u2019t a complete idiot. Bannon is also a true believer in terms of ideology, whereas Hoghead Cheese Hussein doesn\u2019t really care about anything and is largely fueled by KFC, McDonald\u2019s and narcissism.\n\n\n\nWhile both clowns and their factions are frightening for varying reasons, I must say that I am very much looking forward to the white-on-white crime that\u2019s going to happen as a result of Bannon\u2019s White House ID being chopped and screwed. Bannon will want revenge, and that means he will be harassing his former co-workers and perpetual clowns along with all those Pepe the Frog-exploiting fucks. He\u2019ll go even harder on Gargamel, or House Speaker Paul Ryan, as some refer to him, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And knowing Sunkist Stalin, he will tweet something foul about Bannon and really set him off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, please go off, Steve Bannon. What is the white nationalist/white devil equivalent of Lil Jon\u2019s \u201cBust a nigga head to the white meat, white meat\u201d? Tell Bannon to do that to his former colleagues.

John Bel Edwards in June, in hopes of changing Louisiana\u2019s reputation as the most imprisoned state in the country.\n\n\n\nIt is the hope that the act will reduce the state\u2019s prison population by 10-12 percent and save some $262 million over the next 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Prator, it\u2019s all a waste.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the state of Louisiana is risking our safety for bragging rights and to save money,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Prator later would show his whole ass, showing that he really doesn\u2019t care about safety or bragging rights. He is concerned, it would seem, about saving money, but only in the form of cheap or free labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [prisoners] that you can work, the ones that can pick up trash, the work-release programs\u2014but guess what?

Some of those on the list did not qualify for release until 2025, mind you, with charges ranging from possession with intent to distribute marijuana and aggravated flight to DWI and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Correction Secretary James Le Blanc told the news station that he wasn\u2019t sure where Prator was getting his information and facts, and cited inaccuracies in Prator\u2019s assessment of the act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s some opening of the gates and everybody\u2019s releasing here,\u201d Le Blanc said. \u201cThis is 1,400 inmates that are going to 21 different districts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have all the respect in the world for Sheriff Prator. I just don\u2019t know if he really knows what the numbers look like,\u201d he added.\n\nLe Blanc told KSLA that after the first wave of 1,400 inmates are released, releases would taper down to about 30 a month, and once again, it would only affect nonviolent and non-sex offenders who qualify.\n\nAs for the 192 inmates who Prator said were going to be released from Caddo, well, Le Blanc said that as far as he knows, the act only releases 35 come November.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can put people that need to be in these beds in.

His white nationalist stance notwithstanding, as head of Breitbart News, Bannon made no secret of his anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim views long before he hitched his trailer to Trump\u2019s wide-ass wagon.\n\nTrump hinted earlier this week that things might not be looking so good for Bannon when he told reporters Tuesday, \u201cI like him. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s not a racist, I can tell you that, but we\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\u201d\n\nBannon may have been an asset when he effectively mobilized disaffected white male voters during Trump\u2019s campaign, but as NPR points out, that skill set became a liability once the men reached the White House:\n\nThe original, shock-and-awe travel ban spearheaded by Bannon was quickly rejected by federal courts. His efforts to strong-arm lawmakers into passing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act backfired. And Bannon feuded openly with other White House staffers, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course his toeing the proverbial line came to a head earlier this week when he went rogue and gave an unauthorized interview to progressive magazine the American Prospect.\n\nAs reported by The Root\u2019s Stephen A. Crockett Jr., during that interview, Bannon boasted that his opponents inside the departments of Defense, State and Treasury are \u201cwetting themselves,\u201d even adding how he plans to get rid of those who oppose him; he also contradicted Trump\u2019s play on war with North Korea and called white nationalists \u201ca collection of clowns,\u201d something that his boss had been unable to do since the terrorist attacks in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nIt would appear that he signed his own pink slip, as it were.\n\nBut now there are rumors that Bannon is not planning to go without a public, messy fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how all of this plays out.\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["dead", "dick", "white", "interview", "trumps", "bannon", "npr", "dingdong", "week", "hes", "head", "house", "national"], "polarity": 0.07904761904761905, "subjectivity": 0.3330952380952381},

With rumors swirling that the White House chief strategist might not survive the week, Bannon pulled an Anthony Scaramucci Mane and called a reporter to dump all the Lipton.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with progressive publication American Prospect, Bannon boasted that his opponents inside the departments of Defense, State and Treasury are \u201cwetting themselves,\u201d even adding how he plans to get rid of those who oppose his plans; he also contradicted Trump\u2019s play on war with North Korea and called white nationalists \u201ca collection of clowns,\u201d something that his boss had been unable to do since the terrorist attacks in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\u201cEthno-nationalism\u2014it\u2019s losers. It\u2019s a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more,\u201d Bannon told the Prospect.\n\nHe added that he wants Democrats to focus on racism, saying, \u201cIf the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\u201d\n\nA source close to Bannon told CNN that this was not an interview and basically tried to describe Bannon\u2019s conversation with a reporter as akin to what happened with Scaramucci Mane, who, you may remember, called a New Yorker reporter and poured his heart out while reportedly not realizing that he was on the record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s why none of this is making sense to me.\n\nFirst, Bannon has been notoriously absent from the media since joining Trump\u2019s team. He hasn\u2019t done many, if any, interviews since becoming Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nSecond, if anyone understands how the media operates, it\u2019s Bannon. Before taking his post as puppet master of Trump\u2019s administration, Bannon was the founding member of Breitbart News, an \u201calt-right\u201d rag. While they consider themselves a far-right news, opinion and commentary website that just so happens to push some of the most xenophobic, racist dribble this world has ever known, they are still a publication that, for the most part, skates on the fringe of journalistic ethics, and as such, Bannon knew what the fuck he was doing. Even if he didn\u2019t know, he knew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs my grandmother used to tell me all the time when I got caught doing something I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing, \u201cYou are too smart to play dumb now.\u201d I don\u2019t believe for a second that a man who worked for a publication prior to joining the White House and managed to stay out of the media just randomly called a reporter to have a conversation without realizing that said conversation would be on the record. I call bullshit.\n\nAnd last, this seems contrived. The scuttlebutt around Washington is that Bannon is on his way out, and not just out as in someday\u2014out as in, he won\u2019t survive the weekend. So Bannon just so happens to make a call to a reporter the same week that he\u2019s reportedly fallen out of the graces of his son, the emperor, and spills all the tea?\n\nHere\u2019s my thinking: Bannon knows that he\u2019s leaving and wanted to go on record with his true feelings on this administration so that he can stop being the scapegoat for Trump\u2019s white nationalist affections. Or Bannon and Trump are in on this. The whole lot of it. The call is to separate Bannon and Trump\u2019s ideological brain so that the president can look sympathetic to those against white nationalism by keeping Bannon. I know\u2014it\u2019s a long shot, making Bannon the sympathetic one here, but Bannon made it a point to denounce white nationalism during the call, and I don\u2019t think that is accidental.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bannon has pushed the president\u2019s hand, and I like the play, if for nothing else than that I\u2019m all for this Lannister-ass administration\u2019s demise, and the more drama the better. Something is rotten in the state of TrumPutin, and I hope that this is only the beginning.\n\nRead more at the American Prospect and CNN.", "keywords": ["white", "goes", "steve", "doesnt", "calls", "trumps", "nationalism", "called", "lipton", "reporter", "bannon", "media", "doing", "publication", "play", "right", "spills", "rogue"], "polarity": 0.10184510611339881, "subjectivity": 0.3529854292049414},

Being able to see friends and family members in person, to laugh and enjoy conversations together, is a way to make long sentences seem shorter. It helps families stay bonded, helps children know family members who may otherwise be absent from their lives and gives inmates something tangible to remind them that there is a life waiting for them on the outside.\n\nFor inmates in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna, La., those visits will be a thing of the past beginning Oct. 10, when the facility switches to a video-visitation program similar to one implemented at lockups in New Orleans a few years ago, the New Orleans Advocate reports.\n\nNewly promoted Jefferson Parish Sheriff Jeff Lopinto believes that there are many benefits to a video-visitation system. In a statement on Wednesday, he said that one of the biggest benefits would be ending the possibility that visitors would pass contraband to inmates during visits.\n\nIn addition, Lopinto said that although both types of visits require monitoring, it takes fewer staff members to monitor video feeds than it does to monitor in-person visits.\n\nLopinto also believes that video visitation will increase the availability of inmates to see their loved ones. Although in-person visits were available only for two-hour blocks once per week depending on an inmate\u2019s cell assignment, video visitation will allow friends and relatives to communicate with an inmate via cellphone or computer nearly 12 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds promising, right? Too bad it isn\u2019t free.\n\nUsing the video-visitation service remotely will cost nearly $13 for a 20-minute session. That price could be cost-prohibitive to many families and discourage them from using the service. This means that some inmates could become alienated from their families and friends altogether, and that is what some attorneys who work in criminal defense and criminal justice are afraid of.\n\nKatie Schwartzmann is an attorney and co-director of the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center in New Orleans. She and local defense attorneys Jay Daniels and Craig Mordock all told the Advocate that there is research showing that incarcerated people who have access to their loved ones while in jail have an easier time reconnecting with them after they are released, and that helps them avoid returning to a life of crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three attorneys also expressed concern that in this instance, personal contact from the outside world is being removed from a facility that primarily houses people who are awaiting trial and have not been convicted of a crime.\n\n\u201cPeople who are simply detained need access to family members,\u201d Mordock said. \u201cAnd in-person visitation is radically different than doing a Skype session.\u201d\n\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s office, free video-visitation sessions will be made available once a week at a sheriff\u2019s facility in Marrero, La. Three additional visits per day can be arranged, using the remote service, at a cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo: Cash bond system. Check. Costly collect calls. Check. Now charging for inmate visitations.\n\nThis is turning into some sort of government fundraiser, isn\u2019t it?\n\nRead more at the New Orleans Advocate.", "keywords": ["helps", "la", "service", "videovisitation", "pay", "video", "friends", "orleans", "members", "inmates", "visitation", "jail", "lose", "inperson", "visits"], "polarity": 0.11319842947749925, "subjectivity": 0.4327267693546764},

The measure would strike the death penalty from being considered as a sentencing option for aggravated murder. If the bill passes, the harshest sentence in the state would instead be life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe measure now heads to the Statehouse, which has a two-person Democratic majority.\n\nThanks to Gov. Jay Inslee, there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington since 2014.\n\nLawmakers cited the cost of maintaining the death penalty and incidences of wrongful convictions as reasons to abolish capital punishment.

This unequal application of the punishment was among the reasons Gov. Inslee instilled the moratorium.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nIn a written statement issued after the vote, Inslee said that when he enacted the moratorium, \u201cI hoped it would create space for a discussion about the unequal application of this law, the enormous costs of seeking this punishment and the uncertainty of closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d \u201cI hope Washington joins the growing number of states that are choosing to end the death penalty,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the bill passes in the Statehouse, Washington will join 19 other states and the District of Columbia in ridding themselves of the death penalty.

The state of Georgia had already made up its mind to execute Tharpe despite the fact that his attorneys say that his IQ is below the legal threshold for a person to understand the charges or their crime. Even though attorneys agree that Tharpe received \u201chorrifyingly uninformed and unconcerned legal representation,\u201d they were going to kill him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it was the fact that one of the jurors who convicted Tharpe was a virulent racist that prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to demand that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals re-examine Tharpe\u2019s case, citing the court\u2019s error in discounting the racial bias of one of the jurors\u2014namely, Barney Gattie.\n\nIn Georgia, jurors must unanimously decide on the death penalty for it to take effect, which happened after Tharpe\u2019s 1991 murder conviction. Seven years after the conviction, attorneys trying to appeal Tharpe\u2019s case interviewed Gattie and found him to be a racist whose virulent hate would go unmatched until a man with skin the color and consistency of Goldfish crackers took up residence in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they interviewed Gattie, according to Time magazine, he proudly proclaimed, among other things:\n\nThere is a difference between \u201cgood black folks\u201d like the victims Tharpe murdered and \u201cniggers.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe owned a store and routinely kicked \u201cniggers\u201d out of it.\n\n\n\nHe voted for the death penalty because he thinks Tharpe is a \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Nicole Brown Simpson hadn\u2019t married a \u201cnigger\u201d (O.J.

The state of Georgia knew it, but they were going to execute Tharpe anyway. Just typing that sentence gave me the heebie-jeebies because ... white people. Oh, and cold-blooded murder.\n\nBut the Supreme Court granted Tharpe a last-minute stay on the day of his scheduled execution. After reviewing the case, justices basically told the 11th Circuit Court: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me! This juror was way too racist! Maybe you should look at this again.\u201d In a 5-4 Supreme Court decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote:\n\nWhere a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror\u2019s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to The Root, Tharpe\u2019s attorney Brian Kammer said:\n\nWe are thankful that the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the serious implications for fundamental fairness of the clear evidence of racial animus on the part of one of the jurors who sentenced Mr. Tharpe to death.

The organization recently examined homicides committed by civilians between 1980 and 2014 and found that in 1 in 6 of those killings, there was no criminal sanction.\n\nThe term \u201cjustifiable\u201d is used to describe situations where a police officer or civilian kills someone who is committing a crime or in self-defense.\n\nWhile police normally classify less than 2 percent of homicides committed by civilians as justifiable, over the last three decades, in cases where the victim was a black man or boy killed by a non-Hispanic white civilian, 17 percent were categorized as justifiable.\n\nAccording to the Marshall Project, this \u201cdisparity persists across different cities, different ages, different weapons and different relationships between killer and victim.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Marshall Project used dozens of data sets obtained from the FBI and examined various combinations of killer and victim. When looking at \u201cjustifiable homicide,\u201d the Marshall Project noted two types: \u201cfelon killed by private citizen\u201d and \u201cfelon killed by police officer.\u201d\n\nWorth noting: The person killed is presumptively classified as a felon because the only way a homicide can be justified is if a life was threatened, and threatening a life is a crime, which brings us full circle back to the person killed being presumptively classified as a felon.\n\nSelf-defense laws in this country allow people to use deadly force if there is a reasonable belief that force is necessary to defend themselves or others. The interpretation of self-defense laws varies from state to state and often comes down to what the person believed before pulling the trigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitch Vilos is a Utah defense attorney, gun-rights advocate and the author of Self-Defense Laws of All 50 States. He told the Marshall Project that even if what leads a person to think he or she is in danger is a stereotype, it factors in when considering a self-defense claim.\n\nThis is because self-defense decisions made by civilians are the same as those made by police in that they are made quickly, on the fly, with \u201cimperfect information.\u201d Therefore, homicides can be ruled self-defense even if the killers faced no real threat of danger, so long as they had a reasonable belief that they did.\n\nIrrational fear often comes into play in these cases, and the Marshall Project says that police, prosecutors and juries are more apt to give the benefit of the doubt to a killer who was in a situation with a person who seemed \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we all know that black people, no matter age, gender or size, are always reported as having been viewed as being more dangerous than they were.\n\n\u201cTell me that it doesn\u2019t factor in if the person is black when they\u2019re approaching the suspect,\u201d Vilos told the Marshall Project. \u201cIt contributes to the decision to pull the trigger because of the fear associated with the stereotype.\n\n\u201cRight or wrong, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, in my opinion,\u201d Vilos added.\n\nBecause people in these arguments will always bring up the myth of black-on-black crime, the Marshall Project addressed that as well:\n\nThe vast majority of killings of whites are committed by other whites, contrary to some folk wisdom, and the overwhelming majority of killings of blacks is by other blacks. But killings of black males by white people are labeled justifiable more than eight times as often as others. This racial disparity has persisted for decades and is hard to explain based solely on the circumstances reported by the police data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, none of this is a shock to anyone, I\u2019m sure, but it\u2019s fascinating to see the data analyzed in black and white.\n\nThere are always going to be people who will deny that this is a fact, even when presented with hard data and facts. There will always be those who will find a way to justify what has already wrongly been deemed justifiable.\n\nAnd it is commendable that the Marshall Project took the time to look at this situation and analyze it to provide hard-core facts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that we have those hard-core facts, what are we going to do with them?\n\nRead more at the Marshall Project.", "keywords": ["deemed", "justifiable", "killings", "killer", "project", "report", "likely", "marshall", "black", "killed", "selfdefense", "men", "person", "different"], "polarity": 0.023586649271580776, "subjectivity": 0.4444770602304849},

In 1991, when Tharpe was convicted, every juror voted for him to be put to death. If one of those jurors had objected, Tharpe would be serving life in prison. Instead, he is going to die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarney Gattie, who was supposed to be one of those impartial jurors, is a virulent racist. There were probably others, but there is no doubt about Gattie. Lawyers, appellate court judges and even Keith Tharpe know it, but Tharpe is going to be executed anyway.\n\nAccording to Time, lawyers seeking an appeal for Tharpe interviewed Gattie and the rest of the jurors in 1998.

In the wake of Damond\u2019s death\u2014she was fatally shot while unarmed and pajama-clad by Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who was responding to her 911 call\u2014photojournalist Angela Jimenez released a widely circulated video of the 40-year-old Australian veterinarian-turned-yogini rescuing a gaggle of ducklings trapped in a sewer and reuniting them with their distressed mother.\n\nMuch has been made of Damond\u2019s status as the \u201cideal victim.\u201d Robert Bennett, an attorney for Damond\u2019s family, described her as \u201cthe most innocent victim\u201d of a police shooting he had ever seen. Rightfully, black activists and writers have pointed out the hypocrisy implied in his words: that black people who are shot by police are not innocent but somehow deserving of their fates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen white women are killed by police, there are often major institutional outcomes.\n\nDamond was no more innocent than Aiyana Stanley-Jones or Tamir Rice, seven and 12 years old respectively when they were shot by police. But she is the embodiment of what a lot of people understand to be innocence: white, beautiful, kind, affianced. Not the type of person who gets themselves shot by the police.\n\nCompared to the recent past, victims of police violence aren\u2019t receiving as much attention as they once did, so for Damond\u2019s case to dominate headlines and social media tells us something. News of the case reached as far as her native Australia, where the media dubbed the shooting an \u201cAmerican Nightmare\u201d and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull demanded answers and accountability. In short order, just as public protest began to ramp up on Friday, the Minneapolis chief of police was forced by the mayor to resign. Black Lives Matter in Minneapolis has stepped up to put pressure on the mayor, including the same organizers that led protests in the wake of Philando Castile\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustine Damond is not the first white woman killed by police, but their deaths at the hands of the cops are rare. Of the 554 fatal force incidents the Washington Post has tallied this year, 12 were white women and three were unarmed. Last year, unarmed white women were less than 1% of the victims of police shootings. Police often use mental illness or the presence of a deadly weapon\u2014often both\u2014as justifications for shootings involving white women.\n\n\n\nWhen these women are killed by police, there are often major institutional outcomes: the ouster of a police chief, the introduction of mental health units, a federal investigation at a time when it took scores of black deaths at the hands of police and full on riots to get the DOJ involved, and real prison time for an officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe death of a white woman will often result in prison time\u2014which is still more than the vast majority of black victims can hope for.\n\nTake the 1999 case of Colleen Kelly, a suicidal white woman armed with a fanny pack who was shot and killed by Houston police while on her way to get medical help. The outrage surrounding her death, along with that of Sheryl Seymour, a schizophrenic white woman who was shot while brandishing a knife at police in the same year, eventually lead to federal court cases and the HPD reforming their use of force policy for the mentally ill. Now, officers are trained in de-escalation tactics, though critics point out that police are still shooting mentally ill people of all genders at an alarming rate.\n\nIn other cases, the death of a white woman will simply result in prison time\u2014which is still more than the vast majority of black victims can hope for. In 2012, Officer Dan Harmon-Wright shot and killed Patricia Ann Cook as she was sitting in her car in a Catholic school parking lot. Harmon-Wright was responding to a report of a suspicious person in the area, and opened fire into Cook\u2019s Jeep. He was charged with voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s almost never the case that a single police killing of a black person triggers a federal investigation, especially prior to the Black Lives Matter movement. But in 2002, Dawn Rae Nelson, a white woman, was suspected of trying to fill a forged prescription in Chandler, Arizona. Officer Dan Lovelace responded and as he was looking at her back plates, she pulled the car forward. He ran to the driver\u2019s side window and shot in through the window, killing her in front of her 14-month-old son. The mayor of Chandler condemned the shooting and the DOJ investigated through the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. Lovelace was charged with second degree murder but acquitted in 2004. Nelson\u2019s family was awarded a large cash settlement in a civil suit.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Somalis are not faring well in this racially charged political moment.\n\nCases where white women are victims of police violence are so uncommon that it\u2019s difficult to find documentation of them prior to the 1990s. It\u2019s easier to find information about black people because of the Civil Rights Movement, and it wasn\u2019t until the highly politicized Rodney King case\u2014the first well-documented case of \u201ccopwatching\u201d\u2014when activists truly began to frame police brutality as an institutional injustice rather than isolated cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, incidents where white women are shot and killed by police inspire localized outrage and a lawsuit on occasion. But the level of media interest in Damond\u2019s death is rare. The international outrage directed squarely at American policing and gun culture has resonated across borders, only amplifying the spectacle surrounding the shooting.\n\nThat might also have to do with the cop who shot her.\n\nJustine Damond is not simply a white woman killed by police. She\u2019s a white woman killed by a black, Somali man. As the first Somali officer in his precinct, many\u2014including Mayor Hodges\u2014hoped Noor\u2019s presence would foster trust between the city\u2019s sizable Somali population and police.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of Damond\u2019s death, the Blue Lives Matter crowd that typically asks the public to stand behind law enforcement hasn\u2019t rallied around Officer Noor but has instead decried the fact that he was a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d and therefore incompetent. It\u2019s no secret that Somalis\u2014most of whom fit the categories of black, Muslim, and refugee\u2014are not faring well in this racially charged political moment. President Trump singled out Somali nationals for his travel ban and campaigned by ginning up fear of Somalis as terrorists. It\u2019s not surprising that Noor isn\u2019t receiving the same treatment that white officers might. The blue wall of silence doesn\u2019t extend to every cop.\n\nConsider how NYPD Officer Peter Liang was treated after killing Akai Gurley. Officer Liang was described as a \u201crookie\u201d and it was often implied that he was incompetent. It\u2019s become clear that he was, but are incompetent white officers treated similarly? Bratton himself described Gurley as \u201ca total innocent,\u201d essentially condemning his officer as an amoral killer. Liang was charged and convicted of manslaughter, although ultimately he got probation.\n\nBy comparison, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold, received a raise while on modified duty. Bratton said he didn\u2019t believe race had anything to do with the killing and that Garner died because he resisted arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomali American Minnesota state representative Ilhan Omar has pointed out that while Noor is black and Somali, it is more important to consider that a violent police culture is systemic regardless of race or ethnicity. \u201cThe current officer training program indoctrinates individuals of all races into a system that teaches them to act first, think later, and justify with fear,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nHiring a black Somali man was never a solution to police violence or distrust of the cops. To change the police, you have to change the institution.\n\nIn the Trump era, white women are waking up to the political reality of oppression. All this time, Black Lives Matter and other movements have been pointing out that the systems governing this country are fundamentally flawed. Damond\u2019s tragic killing shows us that contrary to the myth of racism, it\u2019s not so much about people holding hate in their hearts as it is about a tradition of violence that is bigger and older than any of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis piece has been updated to reflect the fact that Mohamed Noor is the first Somali officer in his precinct, not in the Minnesota police force.", "keywords": ["white", "victims", "brief", "history", "cops", "killed", "black", "women", "somali", "happens", "damonds", "woman", "shot", "officer"], "polarity": -0.0023692973692973755, "subjectivity": 0.33984848484848484},

But that may change Thursday as the state prepares to execute 53-year-old Mark Asay, and with a drug that has never been used before in any U.S. execution.\n\nAccording to CBS, with contribution from the Associated Press, barring a stay of execution, Asay is set to die by lethal injection after 6 p.m. Thursday. Asay was convicted by a jury of two racially motivated murders in Jacksonville, Fla., back in 1987.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn anesthetic, etomidate, and two other drugs\u2014rocuronium bromide and potassium acetate\u2014will be used in the lethal injection, the Associated Press reports. The execution will be Florida\u2019s first since the U.S. Supreme Court paused the practice more than 18 months ago following a ruling that the state\u2019s death penalty system was unconstitutional because the state\u2019s sentencing system gave too much power to judges over juries.\n\nExecutions statewide came to a stop as Florida lawmakers drew up new legislation, with the result being that ultimately, a jury is required to unanimously agree before sentencing someone to death, the Washington Post notes.\n\nAsay, a former prison gang member who once had a swastika tattoo, was convicted in the deaths of 34-year-old Robert Lee Booker and 26-year-old Renee Torres, who was originally identified in legal documents as \u201cRobert McDowell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors argued that their race was what incited Asay\u2019s violent behavior in 1987. Witnesses and a jail house informant testified that Asay had used racial slurs while he committed the first murder and after the second.\n\nThe night of the murders, Asay was out drinking with his brother and a friend in Jacksonville when they went looking for prostitutes.\n\nAsay\u2019s brother was inside his vehicle and talking to Booker, who stood outside, when Asay walked up and called Booker a \u201cnigger\u201d before pulling out his gun and shooting him in the stomach. Booker died from internal bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsay and the friend, identified as \u201cBubba\u201d McQuinn, fled in Asay\u2019s truck. McQuinn later testified that when he asked Asay why he shot Booker, Asay said, \u201cBecause you got to show a nigger who is boss.\u201d\n\nAfter killing Booker in cold blood, the two kept on looking for prostitutes and stumbled upon Torres. McQuinn testified that Assay grabbed Torres by the arm and shot six times.\n\nThe jury sentenced Asay to death by a 9-3 vote.\n\nThe case has been in going through the rounds ever since, with the execution first stopped by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However, following that decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that only inmates sentenced to death after 2002 would be allowed new hearings. Asay\u2019s case did not fit that criteria, and his attorneys appealed, unsuccessfully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsay then appealed based on the new drug cocktail that would be used, but that was also rejected, with officials defending the use of the new drugs despite reservations about their use.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Department of Corrections follows the law and carries out the sentence of the court,\u201d Michelle Glady, the Florida Department of Corrections\u2019 spokeswoman, said in a statement to AP. \u201cThis is the department\u2019s most solemn duty, and the foremost objective with the lethal-injection procedure is a humane and dignified process.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, another appeal was issued (and rejected) stemming from the racial implications of the case. As the Post notes, for decades, Asay\u2019s victims were both classified as black; however, it turns out that Torres was biracial\u2014white and Hispanic\u2014not black. The court apologized for the mistake and issued a mea culpa, but also ruled that the mistake did not change the outcome of Asay\u2019s death penalty sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnless a court or Florida\u2019s governor decides to step in, Asay\u2019s fate is sealed. He will become the 24th inmate to be executed since Gov. Rick Scott took office, the most under any governor in Florida history, CBS-AP notes.\n\nRead more at CBS News and the Washington Post here and here.", "keywords": ["white", "death", "testified", "man", "killing", "torres", "used", "court", "asay", "inmate", "black", "florida", "fla", "asays", "supreme", "booker", "executed"], "polarity": 0.05055282555282556, "subjectivity": 0.35792383292383295},

Perfect.\n\nLast, you\u2019d need some real-black writers and producers, folks with a track record of success who will fight the networks for all the little details, like having shea butter in the bathroom scenes and showing how a black superhero would really feel about the cops.

It\u2019s. About. To. Go.

He\u2019s settled into a comfortable life as principal of Garfield High School. He\u2019s spitting game to get back his ex-wife, Lynn (Christine Adams from The Mentalist and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), who left him because she couldn\u2019t handle the stress of his double life. As a principal, he can keep an eye on his wild younger daughter, Jennifer (China Anne McClain); and his older daughter, med school student Anissa (Nafessa Williams, from Twin Peaks and Burning Sands), regularly drops by the school to volunteer.\n\nUnfortunately, the 100 gang, led by Tobias Whale, an albino gang leader with a Moby Dick fetish (played by Marvin \u201cKrondon\u201d Jones III), has decided to rip apart the city of Freeland by running everything from prostitution to legitimate businesses and youth centers. The 100 is like what would happen if 100 Black Men of America merged with Hydra. Now, with the help of his old friend and mentor Gambi (James Remar), Pierce has become Black Lightning again to fight fire with lightning.\n\nIt feels like a lot is going on; how the heck do you describe a show like this?\n\n\u201cLuke Cage mixed with Black-ish with maybe a Cosby Show flair ... that might cover it, with a dope soundtrack.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Cress Williams laid it out to me after a long day of filming in Atlanta about a month ago. Both he and Jones are acutely aware of how big a hit Black Lightning could become. Sandwiched between the Netflix-busting Luke Cage and next month\u2019s Black Panther movie, Black Lightning has a window to create its own unique buzz. Yet the actors are acutely aware of how Black Lightning meshes with the expanding mainstream world of black superheroes.\n\nWhen I asked Jones how he developed Tobias Whale, he took me straight to previous shows and comics.\n\n\u201cOf course, Cottonmouth from Luke Cage,\u201d says Jones, who went on to praise the villainous work of Mahershala Ali, whom he considers a friend and mentor. \u201cAnd Wilson Fisk; I love Wilson Fisk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I ask him if there are any real-world people he drew inspiration from for his character, Jones thought for a moment, sitting back in his chair as we sat in a small room during a brief break in filming. Finally, he settled on the perfect mixture: \u201cIt\u2019s that attitude, that \u2018I made it, NIGGA, YOU DIDN\u2019T\u2019 attitude! He\u2019s like Kwame Kilpatrick mixed with Big Meech.\u201d\n\nDamn.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that despite enjoying the cast and crew, I was skeptical about how Black Lightning would turn out. I love comics and superhero shows, but most of the superhero programs on the CW are trash for black people. The black guys are almost always sidekicks or marginalized; the black women exist only as eye candy or love interests for white guys; and the costumes are so bad, most CW heroes look like a flash mob of cosplayers. However, I was more assured when I heard showrunner Salim Akil talk about putting his heart and soul into the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe talked about the crime in Black Lightning\u2019s Freeland being based on his hometown of Richmond, Va. (which has had a top 10 murder rate for the last 20 years). He talked about a showing a new kind of black masculinity on-screen, the kind that is usually suppressed in the sci-fi and fantasy genres.\n\n\u201cIn so many shows, the black man NEVER gets the woman \u2026 it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t have a PENIS!\u201d Akil said, talking about how Jefferson Pierce was going to be a three-dimensional character with love, sexiness and action. I knew I was going to see something new. Turns out I was right.\n\nBlack Lightning is actually a very good show. I\u2019ve watched the pilot three times, twice on a laptop and once during a public screening at the DC in D.C. event last weekend. Every time I watch, I see something different that I like. The action is good, the plot makes sense, and the show flips tone from fun to suspense almost every other scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writers don\u2019t beat you over the head with a message every scene, but Black Lightning operates in the real world of race, police violence and crime. The daughters, Jennifer and Anissa, are fantastic, their banter actually sounds like two sisters talking, and the show posters indicate that before too long, they\u2019ll develop superpowers similar to how they did in the comics.\n\nA superpowered, highly educated, crime-fighting black family in the era of Donald Trump?

Williams was convicted in the murder of a local reporter and was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday, but his attorneys have continued to maintain their client\u2019s innocence, pointing to new DNA evidence they say proves Williams could not have committed the crime.\n\n\u201cA sentence of death is the ultimate, permanent punishment,\u201d Greitens said in a statement. \u201cTo carry out the death penalty, the people of Missouri must have confidence in the judgment of guilt. In light of new information, I am appointing a Board of Inquiry in this case.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nThe attorneys for a Missouri inmate who is scheduled to die Tuesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre are attempting to halt the execution, warning that the state could kill a potentially innocent man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Marcellus Williams, 48, was sentenced to death in the stabbing death of former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Lisha Gayle, who was killed during a 1998 robbery at her home. One of Williams\u2019 attorneys, Kent Gipson, says that DNA testing done in December using techniques not available at the time of Gayle\u2019s killing shows that the DNA found on the murder weapon is from an unknown man, not Williams.\n\nGipson also says that previous DNA testing of hairs found on Gayle\u2019s shirt and fingernails, as well as footprints found at the scene, proves that Williams did not commit the crime.\n\nThe new evidence \u201cmeans in our mind, the actual killer is not him,\u201d Gipson told the newswire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 attorneys have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in a desperate last bid to save their client\u2019s life, asking for a new hearing or for the commutation of his sentence to life in prison. The attorneys have also reached out to Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, asking for clemency.\n\n\u201cThere is no physical evidence, no eyewitnesses that directly connect Williams to the murder, the DNA on the weapon wasn\u2019t his, the bloody footprint at the murder scene wasn\u2019t from Williams\u2019 shoe and was a different size, and the hair fibers found weren\u2019t his,\u201d Gipson told Al-Jazeera. \u201cIt was someone else that killed Gayle, not Williams.\u201d\n\nGipson also pointed to the fact that Williams\u2019 conviction was based on the testimony of two convicted felons\u2014Williams\u2019 former cellmate and an ex-girlfriend\u2014who may have been seeking the $10,000 reward the victim\u2019s family offered in exchange for information leading to an arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry Cole, Williams\u2019 former cellmate, also testified against him, claiming that Williams had confessed to killing Gayle.\n\nWilliams\u2019 short-term girlfriend, Laura Asaro, claimed that she saw scratches on Williams\u2019 neck that were made by the victim.\n\n\u201cThese scratches would leave DNA traces on the victim, but Williams\u2019 DNA was not found underneath the victim\u2019s fingernails, just like it was someone else\u2019s DNA that was found on the murder weapon,\u201d Gipson told Al-Jazeera. \u201cShe also claimed she saw Williams with the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license, which is impossible because Gayle\u2019s license was left at the crime scene.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Loree Anne Paradise, a spokesperson for the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s Office, said that prosecutors remain confident that Williams is guilty of the crime based on other evidence, AP notes.\n\nRead more at the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera.", "keywords": ["gipson", "prove", "murder", "death", "convicted", "governor", "mo", "stays", "inmate", "evidence", "attorneys", "greitens", "missouri", "williams", "execution", "dna", "innocence", "weapon"], "polarity": -0.02064834390415786, "subjectivity": 0.3849466425047821},

If the title didn\u2019t completely turn me off, I didn\u2019t understand the premise. How could an entire series be built around a woman basically stalking her ex and then randomly singing about it? It just seemed weird and sexist, like the title. But as the first-season theme song goes, \u201cIt\u2019s a little more nuanced than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe show was co-created by Aline Brosh McKenna and Rachel Bloom. Mckenna also acts as show runner, executive producer and head writer while Bloom writes the songs on the show\u2014 with Adam Schlesinger and Jack Dolgen\u2014 and stars as attorney Rebecca Bunch. They are so precise with their depictions that you can tell they both care deeply about the subject of mental health and how women are depicted on-screen.\n\nLow-key, Rachel Bloom is who I think people wanted Lena Dunham to be and who Lena Dunham thinks she is. No shade.\n\nAll shade.\n\nBecause of the creators, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is the most realistic depiction of mental illness I have ever seen on a scripted show. Hands down. It\u2019s handled with such care and truth and rare empathetic honesty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main character is neither victim nor villain. She\u2019s just a person who is struggling and is both oblivious to and in denial about her odd behavior. The focus on the surface is her obsession with her ex, but as the series goes on, she\u2019s suffering from depression, anxiety and fixation.\n\nIt\u2019s not about her ex, it\u2019s about how she is clinging to something stable, and craving a specific sort of happiness. To her, the last time she felt loved and safe and happy and optimistic about her future was when they were dating, even if it was a brief period, so she believes that the key to returning to that space for her lies in him.\n\nThe manner in which she goes about ultimately getting and then losing him are played up for TV, but beyond the surface is a humanity that I wasn\u2019t expecting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the seasons go on, you see evidence of her mental state, and are even made privy to a history of mental health breakdowns. But it\u2019s not treated as a joke or a caricature. It\u2019s also not randomly thrown in like the Andre character on Empire who \u201ccatches bipolar\u201d like others catch a cold or a football.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s Rebecca Bunch makes sense based on what we have seen of her and what we know about disordered thinking. As a comedy, it has its moments. Its supporting cast fits the \u201czany comedy\u201d thing, I suppose as a way to lighten the heavy themes, but it\u2019s not about them, either.\n\n\n\nIn the second-season finale, Rebecca\u2019s rapid breakdown is triggered by her \u201cex\u201d-turned-fiance standing her up at the altar. It\u2019s a common sitcom device, but the episodes leading up to it show her manic and obsessive symptoms.\n\nAfter the manic turn, when she does some not-so-great things, she eventually crashes into a depression. This depression leads to suicidal ideation. Her mother finds her Googling \u201cPainless ways to kill yourself.\u201d I gasped when I saw this because I never thought a show would go this far. But then it went even further, showing her foggy and dazed and answering, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d when she\u2019s asked if she\u2019s OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the very last scene is of her swallowing anxiety pill after anxiety pill, washing it all down with a glass of wine. I was near tears watching. I knew she would most likely live, but the depiction of despair and desperation with no neat or easy conclusion was fantastic. She simply stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die. I just wanted the pain to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nI thought that it couldn\u2019t get any better or more realistic than that, but the show follows her into the hospital and then into an eventually more accurate diagnosis. Her \u201canxiety and depression\u201d weren\u2019t being treated correctly because she had been misdiagnosed; her borderline personality disorder was actually made worse by her previous treatment.\n\nThe scene when the doctor read out a list of the symptoms that led to her diagnosis was accurate and revealed so much about the behaviors she\u2019d exhibited in previous episodes; much like in real life, when having an \u201canswer\u201d both helps things make more sense and completely throws your sense of self out of wack.\n\nRebecca struggles with the idea that a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d meant she was inherently flawed. Anyone who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder knows the stages, which include denial, deflection and then begrudging acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never seen that much care and deliberateness placed on a main character\u2019s mental health journey on television.\n\nShe eventually begins to accept the diagnosis but still can\u2019t help acting out. Her diagnosis is not the \u201cend,\u201d it\u2019s just the beginning of the work it takes to live a healthy life. And it\u2019s clear that it is a journey; she slips in and out of checking her behavior and, in the most recent episode, finds herself falling into old habits because she hasn\u2019t yet learned how to reprogram her reactions and is encouraged to do so by attending therapy post-hospitalization.\n\nI\u2019ve always maintained that medication is like moving from an old house to a better one, but therapy is how you learn to navigate your new neighborhood, knowing to turn left for the bank, where previously, you would have made a right. I loved seeing therapy and medication as steps toward wellness and not the cure-all.\n\n\n\nSomething else that really got me was the reaction of the people around her following her suicide attempt and following treatment. Her friends ranged from being overprotective to seemingly distant and also struggling with how to make sense of what happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt drove home the truth of how mental illness affects more than just the person. While most of her friends struggled with their worry and fear, she had one friend who was co-dependent and happy to coddle and conspire with her denial.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend snuck in its mental health agenda in ways that are at once subversive and undeniably clear and relatable. I\u2019m glad I gave the show a chance, despite its title. Still not sure how it\u2019s a comedy, because I can\u2019t say I laughed often. I just know that whatever it is\u2014musical, drama, comedy, puppet show\u2014I\u2019m grateful for such a thoughtful and human look into the world of mental illness.", "keywords": ["sense", "issues", "crazy", "depression", "anxiety", "tackles", "perfectly", "diagnosis", "title", "shes", "comedy", "turn", "health", "exgirlfriend", "mental"], "polarity": 0.09287720327439956, "subjectivity": 0.45320002427479084},

And yet, Black Lightning is telling a very particular story about black lives that\u2019s unlike anything else on the CW right now and it feels very much like it\u2019s operating on a different level than most other TV shows based on comic books.\n\n\n\nBlack Lightning\u2019s first few episodes immediately make it clear that for the time being, Jefferson Pierce\u2019s (Cress Williams) life as a vigilante has always been largely focused on street-level crimes with a direct impact on his community. Long before he became the principal at Freeland\u2019s Garfield High School, Black Lightning dedicated his life to dealing with crime bosses and corrupt politicians when the police could (or would) not.\n\nLike his fellow CW superheroes, Jefferson\u2019s compulsion to patrol the streets of his city is borne out of a desire to protect the innocent and vulnerable. But Black Lightning is distinct from other shows on the network because of the way it carefully brings Freeland\u2019s community to life. It\u2019s always a little odd listening to the Flash or Supergirl talk about how they\u2019ve sworn to protect Central and National City (places they supposedly love) because neither of those cities actually seems like they have any kind of discernible personality to them.\n\nCentral City and National City are\u2014as their generic, cookie-cutter names might suggest\u2014meant to be a blank canvas of sorts for The Flash and Supergirl\u2019s characters to act in front of but never really interact with in any substantive way. There are citizens living out their respective lives, sure, but you never get a sense that there\u2019s a deeper interiority to them the once they wander off camera. Black Lightning\u2019s Freeland, by comparison, is populated by people that look, sound, and feel real, which is a key component to making the show work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause protecting Freeland is ultimately Black Lightning\u2019s primary goal, the city had to be fully realized in a way that makes the audience care about it as well. That kind of commitment to thoughtful world-building would have ensured that Freeland was depicted intelligently no matter what form showrunner Salim Akil wanted the city to take, but the decision to focus on Freeland\u2019s black community is particularly significant.\n\nFreeland\u2019s school system, police force, and local media are all portrayed as consisting almost entirely of black people and something happens when traditionally marginalized communities become the central focus of shows like Black Lightning. There are black supporting characters on every single one of the CW\u2019s other superhero shows, but there\u2019s a very particular way in which those characters\u2019 plotlines seldom delve into stories about their race because they\u2019re supporting characters. There may be the occasional mention of how Joe West\u2019s race impacted his career as a police officer, but The Flash has never really explored what it was like for Joe to raise a white child as if he were his own. That isn\u2019t necessarily the kind of story that we should always want or expect for characters of color simply because of their race, but they\u2019re the kind of narrative texture to a character\u2019s life that makes them seem more three-dimensional.\n\nBecause Black Lightning\u2019s story is so rooted in the lives of black people, you never get the sense that the show might shy away from handling issues relating to race in the heart of each episode\u2019s main plot. Black Lightning doesn\u2019t have to slow things down to get into the Very Special Message About Discrimination because none of the characters need to be reminded what racism or police brutality are. Black Lightning assumes that we as viewers have enough of an understanding of those issues that its characters can tackle them head on, honestly, and sometimes messily\u2014the way actual people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most heartening things about the series\u2019 first few episodes is how the dialogue is written and delivered. Put simply\u2014you can tell that there are plenty of black people in Black Lightning\u2019s writer\u2019s room and their writing from their own personal experiences. Jefferson Pierce\u2019s fatherlike pontification about responsibility and the importance of education comes across as kind of stuffy and kind of condescending, but that\u2019s how parents are with their children. Jefferson\u2019s daughters Anissa (Nefessa Williams) and Jennifer (China Anne McClain) hash it out with their father and never miss an opportunity to challenge his authority even though they know that he fundamentally cares about them.\n\n\n\nWhile watching Black Lightning\u2019s first two episodes, the show\u2019s characters immediately felt familiar because, as a black person, I recognized the broad strokes of their personalities and voices. I know what it\u2019s like to be a black student at a school where the principal knows everybody\u2019s name and is seemingly always in your personal business. I know that slightly overbearing father who worries too much about his children and also wonders if he\u2019s driving them away. I know that exasperated teenager who just wants a chance to live their life outside of their parents\u2019 shadows\u2014I\u2019ve been that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, these story beats have been seen on television before, and in black superhero shows, no less. But what Black Lightning manages to pull off that Luke Cage doesn\u2019t is that it builds out a world rendered in shades of grey as opposed to black and white. When Luke Cage is on screen lecturing someone, you can tell that Luke Cage wants you to side with the titular hero and immediately accept his read on the situation as the accurate one. Black Lightning frames Jefferson Pierce as a more fallible person that other people aren\u2019t afraid to go toe-to-toe with (be they friends or enemies) when they feel it\u2019s necessary. That doesn\u2019t mean that Jefferson\u2019s always (or even usually) in the wrong, but rather that Black Lightning is willing to challenge and be critical of its hero.\n\nIf we\u2019re getting down to the brass tacks of it, Black Lightning\u2019s ultimate superpower is that it\u2019s got a kind of diversity that\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts\u2014diversity in front of the camera, behind it, and in the writer\u2019s room as well. It\u2019s when there are a variety of different narratives, from different perspectives, presented that we can really begin to see the kind of meaningful representation that more and more people are beginning to agitate for in pop culture\u2014which gives Black Lightning an edge that can\u2019t be overstated.", "keywords": ["life", "blackest", "way", "kind", "superhero", "characters", "black", "lightnings", "shows", "lightning", "race", "city", "tv"], "polarity": 0.07253950470499763, "subjectivity": 0.4701542588866529},

We certainly have heavy hitters like Shonda Rhimes and Ava DuVernay to thank for this, as their creations are sorely needed, especially as we dwell under the \u201cleadership\u201d (gag me) of the despotic Orange.\n\n\n\nYou know what isn\u2019t needed, though? #BlackLivesMatter TV specials that are penned in writers\u2019 rooms that are whiter than a pair of Chacos screaming at me about how their dad is a lawyer. But apparently, Marc Guggenheim, the showrunner for Arrow, never received that memo, since he currently has plans to use #BLM in a topical episode for the upcoming sixth season of Batman-Lite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this is a bad idea. A terrible fucking idea, in fact. And the reasons for that are both unique to Marc and his Arrowverse and also comparable to other shows penned by \u201cwell-meaning\u201d all-white writers\u2019 rooms. In the spirit of tackling these things in ascending order of specificity, let us start with the latter:\n\n1. TV shows with no black writers have no business writing a #BlackLivesMatter episode.\n\nThis should go without saying ... or explaining, but every so often, a well-meaning white person goes \u201cwell, actually\u201d with their pen and makes us circle back to say this:\n\nIf you are not black and have no experience living as a black person, you have no business writing an episode about #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is also the case because #BLM (and most other black resistance movements before they are co-opted by cis straight black men) exist only because of queer black women, femmes and transgender people. So not only does grasping #BLM require knowledge about intersectionality, but it also requires a commitment to it if you are planning on making fiction about it.\n\nOf course, some believe that you need to be x race to write about y race, and rather than waste my precious time explaining why that is bullocks, I\u2019d rather remind you of what happens when you decide to venture down a lane that your privilege and lack of intersectional knowledge have not prepared you for:\n\nYou get the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d episode that Orange Is the New Black is now infamous for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are so many things to unpack about that episode and the show that brought it to us. Besides the show coming from the same creator, Jenji Kohan, who made white girls selling weed really cute, this same show received plenty of ire for featuring one of the whitest writers\u2019 rooms I had ever seen, with one or two token people of color (none of whom was black, by the way):\n\nSo, as expected, the episode was abysmal. Fan favorite Poussey was senselessly murdered by one of Litchfield\u2019s finest, Baxter Bayley, during a peaceful protest. The protest had started out normal enough but went left after Captain Piscatella purposely escalated it, triggering Suzanne\u2019s manic episode. Anti-black racism and ableism intersected, Poussey interceded on Suzanne\u2019s behalf and she paid for it with her life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you were a huge fan of hers, you got to watch her die as she was choked out and suffocated under Bayley\u2019s weight. You got to watch Taystee wail at the sight of her lifeless body. You got to watch that same body spend days on the cafeteria floor, seemingly forgotten. You got to watch them spend an entire episode (hell, episodes) humanizing Poussey\u2019s murderer, infantilizing him and his actions by implying that he was good kid who made a mistake.\n\nYou saw all of that. Kohan made sure you had to sit through that. And I honestly have never been so disgusted in my life. I experienced every single emotion I had ever experienced when hearing that yet another black person had been gunned down before their time.\n\nI have not watched OITNB since.\n\nBecause for all of Kohan\u2019s lip service about trying to tell diverse stories, she did not bother putting in the work to find diverse voices to tell these stories. And what we got as a result was typical black torture porn and an abysmal interpretation of what she and her white writers\u2019 room think #BLM means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, as badly as OITNB botched the #BLM cause, Arrow would be even worse. And here\u2019s why:\n\n2. Arrow has squandered every opportunity it has had to discuss race or other means of marginalization in a meaningful way.\n\nTo understand Arrow\u2019s shortcomings, we must understand its host network, the CW. The CW likes to avoid race. Most of its shows take a colorblind approach to things, thinking themselves to be progressive in that way. There\u2019s that and the fact that they are famous in blerd spaces for their colorist castings and believe that attractive black people (read: women) come in only two shades: Halle Berry and Queen Latifah. There have been outliers cast here and there that don\u2019t fit that description, but in general, that\u2019s how the CW rolls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being so, it comes as no surprise that Guggenheim\u2019s Arrowverse takes on the same flippant attitude in regards to race\u2014with Arrow being the worst offender.\n\n\n\nBefore I continue, I will say that I have not watched Arrow since season 3 Because of its treatment of women and people of color, and I haven\u2019t watched The Flash since season 2, for a variety of reasons. That said, both shows dance around the issue entirely, not even daring to broach it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Flash is perhaps the most baffling example of this, because it has spent its entire existence avoiding the implications of its white protagonist, Barry Allen, being adopted by a black family (the Wests). Which is ironic, really, because even though the The Flash has featured more POC in its main cast than probably all six seasons of Arrow, it fundamentally misunderstands race, proving that diverse characters without diverse creatives ring hollow.\n\nArrow, on the other hand, is far worse. While The Flash attempts to look the part, Arrow is unbothered. Its longtime token black character, John Diggle, sees his character development continually shafted to make room for Oliver Queen\u2019s brooding sessions. But none of this should come as a surprise if you are aware of how Guggenheim has treated even the white characters on Arrow.\n\nOliver, who originally leaned so far left in the comics that he surpassed \u201cbleeding heart liberal\u201d status and made Batman look quite ineffective in the process, has been morphed into a crypto-fascist by Guggenheim\u2019s hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd no one has been treated more poorly than Laurel Lance.\n\nLaurel (a white woman), who is supposed to be Black Canary, the level-headed superhero with a sonic scream that can kill and one of the best fight combatants in the DC, has turned into a hollow caricature of herself. She is repeatedly written to pine after the equally canonically uncharacteristic Oliver and gets into a cold war over him with her bisexual sister, Sara (who was mistreated and eventually fridged, only to be haphazardly resurrected). She also never really gets to grow into her Black Canary persona. Instead, Guggenheim throws her into the role to prove how reckless she is when left to her own devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question: If Guggenheim cannot even get white characters right, what the hell makes him think that he has the skills to take on a #BLM episode?\n\nStill unconvinced? I don\u2019t blame you. But while I\u2019m ahead, let me add one more example to the list to sway you.\n\n3. Guggenheim\u2019s treatment of the Glades.\n\nTo elaborate, the Glades is the equivalent of the hood and/or the ghetto in Starling City. Where Arrow and team call home. And it is central to the plot in season 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 1 sees Malcolm Merlyn (who is white) and a pack of rich elites (who include Oliver Queen\u2019s father) spearheading a plan to purify Starling City and purge it of all its ills. If you can read between the lines, this means they were essentially planning to accomplish this by eradicating the Glades and wiping it off the map.\n\nAnd mind you, this is chiefly because Merlyn\u2019s wife\u2014who was also white\u2014happen to be killed there. Oliver is eventually clued into this plot because of his father\u2019s defection and eventual death (which he repeats ad nauseam in the show\u2019s opening sequence). However, even with that knowledge and all the help he can muster, Merlyn succeeds in using a machine to force an earthquake that makes the Glades collapse on itself, killing and displacing thousands.\n\nIn Merlyn\u2019s mind, these people deserve to die because one white woman was murdered. Merlyn never considers, even momentarily, trying to improve the quality of life in the Glades. Nah, it\u2019s better for him and his rich friends to blow it to hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, if Guggenheim were as woke as he thinks he is, he\u2019d have used this as an opportunity to explore the ills of environmental racism and to explore the very dangerous intersection of racism and classism in Merlyn\u2019s plan\u2014a plan that no doubt included purposely murdering many poor black and brown (as well as poor white) citizens in the Glades. But none of that is elaborated on or even hinted at. Nope. Guggenheim and his creative team just decide to gentrify the Glades and then move on.\n\nAnd this is the team you want me to trust with a #BlackLivesMatter episode? The same team who put one of their Jewish characters in a gas chamber during Hanukkah? The same universe who turned all their white superhero faves\u2014Super Girl, Arrow and the Flash\u2014into alternate-universe Nazis? The same team who botched the conversation on gun control by taking a nonstance and denying an actual gun-violence victim a chance to speak their piece? This team? This universe? In this climate?\n\nNo. Absolutely not.\n\nBecause respectfully speaking, y\u2019all got me fucked up.", "keywords": ["white", "blm", "juice", "addressing", "blacklivesmatter", "aint", "black", "glades", "shows", "episode", "team", "guggenheim", "writers", "arrow", "business"], "polarity": 0.04337227390418881, "subjectivity": 0.4789076172054894},

The envelope also contained three white business cards with the words \u201cYou are an Honorary Member of S.P.O.N.G.E.\u201d on one side and \u201cSociety for the Prevention of Niggers Getting Everything\u201d on the other side. The second envelope, received on March 28, contained an index card with a noose made of green twine taped to the card, according to the report.

A young black woman narrating. References to Fannie Lou Hamer and Harriet Tubman. Mentions of SZA and Solange. Testosterone might power Black Lightning, the superhero, but a healthy dose of estrogen helps drive Black Lightning, the series.\n\nIn the series, based on the DC Comic launched in 1977, actor Cress Williams (who\u2019s been paying dues as far back as Scooter on Living Single and Lavon Hayes on Hart of Dixie) plays Jefferson Pierce, a hometown Olympic-gold-medal hero-turned-do-gooder principal at Garfield High and community leader, forced to secretly crusade as Black Lightning. Forced because the father of two daughters\u2014high schooler Jennifer (China Anne McClain) and medical student Anissa (Nafessa Williams)\u2014still pines for their mother, Lynn (Christine Adams, Agent Weaver from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).\n\nUnable to handle the painful physical demands and the emotional toll on Jeff (broken bones, bloody wounds), Lynn made it painfully clear that there would be no \u201cwe\u201d with Black Lightning around, eventually divorcing Jeff. And though he suppressed his superhero alter ego, opting to \u201csave more lives as a principal,\u201d she has yet to relent.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t stop Jeff\u2019s eyes from burning with desire for only her (even though there is at least one woman waiting in the wings to happily scoop him up). Because, ultimately, he\u2019s \u201cjust a man who wants his woman back,\u201d he desperately wants to let go of Black Lightning, especially since there is clearly still love on Lynn\u2019s part, too\u2014if only she would allow herself to go there. But despite Jeff\u2019s best intentions, the streets keep calling and derailing their reunion. Since his heart also bleeds for his girls, he will do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even if it means resurrecting Black Lightning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Jeff\u2019s daughters are no damsels in distress. Instead, they are formidable forces in their own right: Jennifer is \u201ca standout scholar-athlete, just like her father,\u201d while Anissa chips in as a health educator. Both are intelligent and strong-willed free thinkers steeped in black history\u2014and \u201cherstory.\u201d While Jennifer is in the throes of teenage rebellion, Anissa goes #BlackLivesMatter hard for social justice. And though their father doesn\u2019t hesitate to protect them, Black Lightning shows that these young women are more than capable of handling themselves. In fact, their strength foreshadows the superhero gifts that surely await them.\n\nStill, some challenges are too big to fight alone. When the rebellious Jennifer entangles herself with local gang the 100, putting both herself and her sister in danger, their father is left with few options to save them. But Black Lightning soon discovers that he can\u2019t just use his gift to save his own and walk away; his entire community is in danger, and just putting in work at Garfield High isn\u2019t going to change that. However, his necessary heroics don\u2019t dim the community\u2019s female voices and concerns.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments in Black Lightning is that the 100\u2019s reign of terror very much includes the sexual violation and exploitation of young black women. Sex trafficking is actually tagged as one of their most egregious crimes here, while most crime stories in urban communities\u2014fictional as well as real-life depictions\u2014overlook the high price that black girls and women pay with their bodies and lives. It\u2019s a grim reality to address in a world that often acts as if black womanhood is expendable and black girlhood is nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually refreshing, black female sexuality isn\u2019t just a straight affair. Through elder daughter Anissa, queer black women are represented and acknowledged. Though this is also true of the comic book series, television is notorious for not following the rules.\n\nBut Anissa\u2019s sexuality is not just significant to the superhero genre; queer black women are typically ignored in all stories, even in LGBTQ-focused ones\u2014and especially in black ones. If they are depicted at all, as in the recent She\u2019s Gotta Have It, it\u2019s more fetishistic than real. Even as black gay men become more regular fixtures in television, demanding at least obligatory representation in contemporary black stories like Insecure, black gay women remain invisible\u2014or seemingly unicorns, like in Survivor\u2019s Remorse. So Black Lightning\u2019s inclusion is a key departure.\n\nBlack Lightning seizes every opportunity to show that black women are very much an organic part of the black community, far beyond the classroom and the church. From the TV news anchor to the cop at the police station to the senator speaking at the school fundraiser, black women are well-represented here. And they aren\u2019t cookie-cutter in appearance, either\u2014not even in hairstyles. Jennifer wears her hair straight and long and Anissa is loose and curly, while their mother, Lynn, is close-cropped. And as a bonus, the women featured are overwhelming chocolate sisters. So clearly the Kerry Washingtons, Issa Raes and Rutina Wesleys are making strong impressions on showrunners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to how we are represented on the small screen, screenwriter and producer Mara Brock Akil just keeps raising the bar. From Girlfriends to Being Mary Jane\u2014with a little of The Game in between\u2014she has been a key catalyst for projecting images of the contemporary black woman on TV. That she\u2019s been able to accomplish this largely by creating and collaborating with her husband, Salim Akil, is even more impressive. Salim Akil might well be the driving force behind bringing Black Lightning to TV, but the execution clearly demonstrates that he and his wife balance each other out.\n\nEven in the male-dominated superhero genre, the Akils have managed to adapt 1970s idealism to the harsh realities of now, without forcing black women to the background, while staying true to the comics\u2019 black-family spirit. With Black Lightning, they\u2019ve created a TV series for the present that finally includes us all.", "keywords": ["ladies", "doesnt", "father", "superhero", "anissa", "black", "women", "young", "lightning", "jennifer", "woman", "tv", "strike"], "polarity": 0.052559820275647574, "subjectivity": 0.4887036305021914},

Debra Clayton and his ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon, who was pregnant at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyala also said that she would not pursue the death penalty in future cases, citing various reasons, including studies that show it provides no public safety benefits, is not a deterrent and ends up costing the state more than cases in which the defendant is sentenced to life.

The 100 is like what would happen if 100 Black Men of America merged with Hydra. Now, with the help of his old friend and mentor Gambi (James Remar), Pierce has become Black Lightning again to fight fire with lightning.\n\nIt feels like a lot is going on; how the heck do you describe a show like this?\n\n\u201cLuke Cage mixed with Black-ish with maybe a Cosby Show flair ... that might cover it, with a dope soundtrack.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Cress Williams laid it out to me after a long day of filming in Atlanta about a month ago. Both he and Jones are acutely aware of how big a hit Black Lightning could become. Sandwiched between the Netflix-busting Luke Cage and next month\u2019s Black Panther movie, Black Lightning has a window to create its own unique buzz. Yet the actors are acutely aware of how Black Lightning meshes with the expanding mainstream world of black superheroes.\n\nWhen I asked Jones how he developed Tobias Whale, he took me straight to previous shows and comics.\n\n\u201cOf course, Cottonmouth from Luke Cage,\u201d says Jones, who went on to praise the villainous work of Mahershala Ali, whom he considers a friend and mentor. \u201cAnd Wilson Fisk; I love Wilson Fisk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I ask him if there are any real-world people he drew inspiration from for his character, Jones thought for a moment, sitting back in his chair as we sat in a small room during a brief break in filming. Finally, he settled on the perfect mixture: \u201cIt\u2019s that attitude, that \u2018I made it, NIGGA, YOU DIDN\u2019T\u2019 attitude! He\u2019s like Kwame Kilpatrick mixed with Big Meech.\u201d\n\nDamn.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that despite enjoying the cast and crew, I was skeptical about how Black Lightning would turn out. I love comics and superhero shows, but most of the superhero programs on the CW are trash for black people. The black guys are almost always sidekicks or marginalized; the black women exist only as eye candy or love interests for white guys; and the costumes are so bad, most CW heroes look like a flash mob of cosplayers. However, I was more assured when I heard showrunner Salim Akil talk about putting his heart and soul into the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe talked about the crime in Black Lightning\u2019s Freeland being based on his hometown of Richmond, Va. (which has had a top 10 murder rate for the last 20 years). He talked about a showing a new kind of black masculinity on-screen, the kind that is usually suppressed in the sci-fi and fantasy genres.\n\n\u201cIn so many shows, the black man NEVER gets the woman \u2026 it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t have a PENIS!\u201d Akil said, talking about how Jefferson Pierce was going to be a three-dimensional character with love, sexiness and action. I knew I was going to see something new. Turns out I was right.\n\nBlack Lightning is actually a very good show. I\u2019ve watched the pilot three times, twice on a laptop and once during a public screening at the DC in D.C. event last weekend. Every time I watch, I see something different that I like. The action is good, the plot makes sense, and the show flips tone from fun to suspense almost every other scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writers don\u2019t beat you over the head with a message every scene, but Black Lightning operates in the real world of race, police violence and crime. The daughters, Jennifer and Anissa, are fantastic, their banter actually sounds like two sisters talking, and the show posters indicate that before too long, they\u2019ll develop superpowers similar to how they did in the comics.\n\nA superpowered, highly educated, crime-fighting black family in the era of Donald Trump?

Critics of the drug contend that inmates are sometimes able to feel pain, and say it has been the culprit in several bungled and inhumane executions in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the controversy, many pharmaceutical companies have restricted their drugs from use for capital punishment, and some states have difficulty finding midazolam. Arizona announced last year that it would stop using it in part because of the logistical challenges; some lawmakers in Mississippi actually proposed using a firing squad because of such issues.\n\n\u201cIt is uncertain as to whether another drug can be obtained,\u201d Hutchinson said in the statement, \u201cand the families of the victims do not need to live with continued uncertainty after decades of review.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, the governor signed proclamations setting four execution dates for the eight inmates between April 17 and 27. Two men would be put to death on each of the four dates.\n\n\n\nIf Arkansas follows that timetable, it will earn the distinction of killing prisoners at a rate unmatched by any state since the United States resumed the death penalty in 1977.\n\n\n\nBrian Stull, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that something was more likely to go wrong with such an aggressive execution schedule.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEach of these prisoners is a person with rights that have to be honored, and each execution is a process that needs to be planned and handled with care and close attention to detail,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just impossible for Arkansas on this schedule. Because they\u2019re trying to do too much, too quickly, with too little preparation. It\u2019s likely to lead to botched executions.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe death penalty, of course, has been proved to be racially biased. The Death Penalty Information Center reports that of the chief district attorneys in counties using the death penalty in the United States, nearly 98 percent are white and only 1 percent are African American. Further, it reports:\n\nExaminations of the relationship between race and the death penalty, with varying levels of thoroughness and sophistication, have now been conducted in every major death penalty state. ... Race is more likely to affect death sentencing than smoking affects the likelihood of dying from heart disease.

Fun as it was, the process of picking out which superhero I wanted to be always stressed me out for one particular reason that still bothers me to this day.\n\n\n\nBack then, it felt odd flipping through my mental Rolodex of characters and realizing that, if I wanted to play as a black hero, it was almost guaranteed that I\u2019d be doing jazz hands to simulate zapping people with lightning. See, there are a lot of black comic book characters with electricity-based superpowers. A lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly, there are a number of differences between Storm, Black Lightning, (Black Lightning\u2019s daughter) Lightning, Black Vulcan, Juice, Static, and Shango the Thunderer. But there\u2019s also something about them all that feels derivative at best and stereotypical at worst, considering that the vast majority of the most popular black superhero characters were created by white men. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that Black Vulcan was created by Hanna-Barbera for the Superfriends cartoon, which producers felt needed a black character even though Black Lightning already existed. It\u2019s also worth pointing out Black Vulcan was created after Black Lightning\u2019s creator Tony Isabella left DC over creative differences.)\n\nThe earliest black superheroes like Black Panther and Luke Cage crossed the comic book color line with their technology and super strength, but over the years, electrokinesis has seemingly become to go-to power black characters are most often assigned. But why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the fifth issue of Mark Waid and Peter Krause\u2019s Irredeemable, Volt, a member of the book\u2019s answer to the Justice League, apprehends a kidnapper while sheepishly admitting to the people around him that yes, he\u2019s a black hero with electricity powers and yes, he knows that it\u2019s a Thing\u2122, and he\u2019s kind of embarrassed about it.\n\nWhile Volt\u2019s powers are a playful jab at superhero comics as a whole, they do raise a number of questions about what it means exactly when creators choose to turn black characters into walking, talking batteries. Taken purely at face value, it\u2019s not difficult to understand what makes electrokinesis popular with creators. For one thing, it can make for some of the most visually arresting art you can imagine, and with the right sort of creativity, electrokinesis can be used in a variety of novel, clever ways beyond simply discharging energy.\n\nWriter Matt Wayne has helped give Milestone Media and DC Comics\u2019 character Static his signature voice on a number of projects like the Static Shock animated series and various comics like Static and The Brave and the Bold: Milestone. When I spoke with Wayne recently, he assured me that, when creating a new character and deciding which powers they should have, every comics writer sits down and considers how similar their creation will end up to others that came before them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStatic\u2019s powers, Wayne told me, were meant to be an extension of his geeky personality and the kinds of science fair projects he enjoyed working on. In other cases, though, Wayne reasoned that electrokinetic powers were the perfect way of having a black hero around who could participate in a fight, but not necessarily be the one to win the fight.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think maybe some of it is that these kinds of heroes are usually physically vulnerable. So they get their hits in and get taken out. There\u2019s definitely an unconscious undercutting of black heroes, keeping them just shy of being a heroic ideal, that used to be more pronounced,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cIn that vein, maybe electricity can be an unconscious expression of the hero\u2019s \u2018tamable\u2019 nature?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it\u2019s heartening to hear directly from a writer about how much thought they personally put into crafting a character\u2019s identity, the point still stands that black heroes with electrical powers are an established trope.\n\nPersonally, the thing that\u2019s always stuck with me about most black heroes with nature-based power sets is the very thin line writers and artists have to walk to make sure the character isn\u2019t being depicted as a \u201csavage.\u201d The idea that black people are inherently closer to nature is one of the larger undertones to the problematic magical negro trope that many black characters are often hamstrung by.\n\nThe Black Electricity Trope reads like a distant cousin to the Magical Negro, in that they\u2019re both established formulations of a character whose most defining qualities are a preternatural understanding and command of natural force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt goes without saying that Storm is perhaps the most iconic example of a the Black Electricity Trope, but she\u2019s also a character who\u2019s transcended much of its limitations as a result of being written and depicted thoughtfully across a variety of different mediums. Storm isn\u2019t just a black hero who throws lightning bolts, she\u2019s one of the most complicated and nuanced comic book characters created in the past 40 years.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Storm as both a lethal weather goddess and a vulnerable human. She\u2019s incredibly strong, but you always get the sense that at the center of whatever devastating weather phenomena she\u2019s manifested, there\u2019s a human who\u2019s just as powerful even when she doesn\u2019t have her powers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of solid characterization and fleshing out of a personality, Wayne told me, that\u2019s the key making sure that a character doesn\u2019t become reduced to a two-dimensional stereotype.\n\n\u201cKnow who your character is. Black Lightning wouldn\u2019t defeat a villain the same way that Static would,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cAlthough, Black Vulcan\u2019s approach would probably be indistinguishable from Black Lightning\u2019s. The only difference would be who gets paid.\u201d", "keywords": ["superheroes", "static", "storm", "wayne", "superhero", "characters", "black", "character", "lightning", "electricity", "powers", "shes"], "polarity": 0.11269915710391908, "subjectivity": 0.5333505119219403},

On Wednesday the Supreme Court of the United States ordered a new hearing for Buck, a black Texas inmate who has sat for years on death row, after hearing claims that improper testimony about his race got him sentenced to death.\n\n\n\nAs The Guardian reports, justices voted 6-2 in favor of Buck, who has spent 19 of 20 years of incarceration on death row. Buck, who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend and another man, has argued for years that testimony by \u201cexpert\u201d witness Dr. Walter Qujiano resulted in the racially tainted sentencing. Quijano testified that Buck was more likely to commit future acts of violence solely because he is black.\n\nQuijano\u2019s testimony was especially damning because in Texas, the death sentence is an option only if the jury finds unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual would continue to commit acts of violence.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion that the federal appeals court that heard Buck\u2019s case was wrong to deny him a new hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a reasonable probability that Buck was sentenced to death in part because of his race,\u201d Roberts said in his opinion. \u201cThis is a disturbing departure from the basic premise that our criminal law punishes people for what they do, not who they are.\u201d\n\nRoberts wrote that Quijano\u2019s testimony was \u201cpotent evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Quijano\u2019s testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype\u2014that of black men as \u2018violence prone,\u2019\u201d the justice added. \u201cWhen a jury hears expert testimony that expressly makes a defendant\u2019s race directly pertinent on the question of life or death, the impact of that evidence cannot be measured simply by how much air time it received at trial or how many pages it occupies in the record. Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.\n\nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing Buck, released a statement Wednesday celebrating the win.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision sends a powerful message that no court can turn a blind eye to racial bias in the administration of criminal justice,\u201d Christina Swarns, counsel of record for Buck and LDF\u2019s litigation director, said in a statement. \u201cGiven the persistence of racialized fears, stereotypes and discrimination, this decision is as important to the country as it is to Duane Buck.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at The Guardian.", "keywords": ["death", "hearing", "justice", "wrote", "court", "testimony", "inmates", "orders", "sentence", "racially", "case", "race", "violence", "statement", "buck", "supreme", "texas"], "polarity": 0.0628099173553719, "subjectivity": 0.5403909222091041},

It was the same jury that found Roof guilty of 33 counts for the attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nThroughout the trial, Roof showed no remorse for his actions, insinuating that he \"had to\" commit the heinous crime, and writing in a jailhouse journal that he did not shed any tears for his innocent victims.\n\nTimes reporter Alan Blinder tweeted that Roof's formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government has not killed a prisoner since 2003, the Times notes.\n\nUpdated Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, 4 p.m. EST: Jury deliberations for sentencing began Tuesday around 1:30 p.m. after closing statements in convicted white supremacist Dylann Roof's death penalty trial. On Tuesday, Roof gave a brief statement, once again showing no remorse for the shooting that left nine black parishioners dead at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go into a church and kill people,\u201d he began his statement, according to the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoof said that he could ask the jury to give him a life sentence, \"but I'm not sure what good that would do.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old also clarified comments in which he expressed that he \"had\" to kill the Charleston Nine.\n\n\u201cObviously, that\u2019s not true because I didn\u2019t have to do it,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cNo one has to do anything.

The same jury that found Roof guilty of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes resulting in death, will decide whether he receives the ultimate punishment.\n\nHowever, if the jurors cannot reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty, the default sentence will be life in prison without the possibility of parole, Gergel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJurors heard four days of testimony from prosecution witnesses during the penalty phase, during which family members and friends recounted heartfelt memories about the shooting victims at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. Prosecutors also produced evidence that Roof continued to express his white supremacist ideology after his arrest, showing no remorse in his writing in a jail-cell journal.\n\n\"I am not sorry,\" he wrote. \"I do not shed a tear for the innocent people that I killed.\"\n\nRoof opted not to offer any witnesses or evidence in his defense, merely giving a two-minute opening statement during which he insisted that there was nothing wrong with him psychologically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Reuters.\n\n", "keywords": ["death", "white", "sc", "sentenced", "dylann", "roof", "charleston", "jury", "black", "trial", "massacre", "church", "supremacist", "sentencing", "times"], "polarity": 0.0066686343959071245, "subjectivity": 0.4372792863701954},

We are listening. Because opening with Malcolm means it\u2019s about to go down.\n\nShe followed up by calling the United States the greatest nation on earth, but reminding us: \u201cIn 1877, America put laws in place called the Jim Crow laws,\u201d and those laws \u201crestricted the rights of quadroons, octoroons, blacks, Hispanics, Malays ... they restricted medical, relationships, education, in all, \u201cthey restricted life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also quoted Martin Luther King Jr., and then she got animated, telling the crowd that the price of freedom is certainly not free.\n\n\u201cWe only move forward when it doesn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.\u201d\n\nShe noted that women of color, if they are raped or sexually assaulted before the age of 18, are 66 percent more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of girls who are sexually trafficked are girls of color,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey are coming out of the foster care system, they are coming out of poverty.

But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth.

Sadly, though, this is America and the White House is run by one of the most evil characters ever known to man: White Satan.\n\n\n\nWhite Satan does not care about domestic violence charges, unless domestic violence charges were connected to, say, a Latino-and-African-American football player who kneels during the national anthem; then the president would really care about domestic violence issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow reports are emerging that Rob Porter, the disgraced former White House secretary who handled classified documents although he never had security clearance, was lobbying for a higher position in Trump\u2019s administration at the time he abruptly resigned.\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN explains the White House\u2019s love affair with Porter:\n\nHis anticipated elevation further highlights how top White House officials were willing to overlook indications from the FBI that there were potential abuse allegations in his background in exchange for professional competence in a tumultuous West Wing. Porter had been actively lobbying to take on new policy portfolios outside the traditional scope of the staff secretary, one person familiar with the matter said, which included speechwriting duties and a role in planning policy rollouts. Neither of those tasks is traditionally carried out by the staff secretary. One of the areas Porter was set to delve further into was trade policy, according to the person. Porter was a regular attendee at a weekly trade meeting among top-level administration officials. He was also being considered for the deputy chief of staff position, another source familiar with the situation said. CNN reported Friday that Jim Carroll, who served as the deputy chief of staff for less than three months, was stepping down to helm the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Several White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were receptive to promoting Porter. Kelly had told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential. CNN has reported that Kelly was aware for months of the potential that Porter\u2019s ex-wives could present damaging information on him. Kelly \u201cdefinitely wanted to expand his role,\u201d a source familiar tells CNN.\n\nIf only there were a group of superhuman women who could have stopped White Satan from getting into a office. A powerful group of women who donned magical pink pussy hats and who marched in force. If only those women had a candidate who spoke to their issues and rallied behind their causes, maybe the world would be in better shape and we wouldn\u2019t know Rob Porter as anything other than the scum he is accused of being.

Just when you think that the allegations coming from one of the most revered and respected adobes worldwide can\u2019t get any worse, the entire White House\u2014staff, administration, housekeeping\u2014is like, \u201cHold my folders.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the White House was rocked by allegations that Staff Secretary Rob Porter abused two of his ex-wives. The rumors were supported by photos showing one of Porter\u2019s ex-wives with a black eye. Now several sources are reporting that the White House was fully aware of claims that Porter was a serial abuser and not only hired him but also allowed him to continue an untrammeled rise within the administration\u2014including dating Trump\u2019s fake daughter, Hope Hicks, to whom the president affectionately creepily refers as \u201cHopie\u201d and \u201cHopester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, the president knew for months that Porter had been accused of domestic abuse, and even after Tuesday\u2019s bombshell report by the Daily Mail, which included claims that Porter was both verbally and physically abusive to his ex-wives, the White House was still scrambling to keep him on staff.\n\nPorter denied the allegations but resigned Wednesday. The White House, however, announced shortly after his resignation that Porter wouldn\u2019t be leaving the White House immediately, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,\u201d Porter said in a statement provided by the White House, Axios reports. \u201cMy commitment to public service speaks for itself. I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question, why is the White House working so hard to keep Porter on staff? Well, I can\u2019t make this any plainer: Porter is dating Hopie! Hopie is not only the president\u2019s fake daughter (totally normal for this president to have a fake daughter; seriously, there is nothing to see here) but is also considered a member of the untouchable staff, which includes the president\u2019s actual family. CNN notes that before Porter resigned, Hopie, who serves as the White House communications director, helped draft a supportive statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him,\u201d the statement from Kelly reads, CNN reports.\n\nKelly now notes that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the allegations against Porter but stands by his initial statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, get this, CNN notes that the claims against Porter were found during a routine background check by the FBI a year ago. So Porter worked at the White House for a year, worked very closely with the president and his chief of staff, but didn\u2019t have security clearance? Where they do that at?\n\nClearly, President \u201cGrab \u2019em by the Pussy\u201d is no feminist. Hell, he told the repugnantly smug Piers Morgan as much during a recent interview. He\u2019s never been a champion of women\u2019s rights, yet 53 percent of white women voted against their self-interests to put him in office.\n\nThis president is trash, and clearly everyone around him is such. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that the president is flying by the seat of his pants and wearing his KFC bucket on his head because he has no clue what he\u2019s doing in the White House and doesn\u2019t care whom he offends. Porter shouldn\u2019t have needed to resign because he never should have been hired! But they knew that and did it anyway because, well ...

So much for uncharted territory here. Well, Annalise is out of jail now, so that\u2019s new.\n\nNow that she\u2019s out and rewigged, she goes to stare at the charred remains of her house\u2014looks like she\u2019s facing the reality of what\u2019s been going on outside her jail cell. She gets a call and goes to meet up with Nate, who is now back on her side, apparently. The night of the fire, we see Wes tell Nate about all Annalise did to help him over the years, which apparently didn\u2019t do much to sway him then, but\u2026 is causing Nate to go to Annalise after he gets in trouble with A.D.A. Bae? Hmm. For all the angry, wounded good guy shit he\u2019s been on since the first season, he sure is seeming\u2026 shrewd lately. In any case, it looks like Nate probably didn\u2019t kill Wes, though he is quite worried about being placed there all the same, after having taken a call from the police department inside the house. And having some survivor\u2019s guilt, in the first vulnerable moment he\u2019s had with Annalise in a while. I admittedly am too exhausted with the two of them to care, but I am holding out hope that there will be nekkid Nate body on my screen very soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next day, Laurel is still on her grieving vigilante tip and trying to figure out who killed Wes instead of acting \u201cweak and victimy\u201d (?). There\u2019s something about making one of your characters the overzealous avatar of the entire mystery of the season\u2019s arc that\u2019s a little bit grating over multiple episodes. Admittedly, I am here for characters continuing to put a boot up Annalise\u2019s ass so she does more. Impotent Annalise is interesting, but I\u2019m exhausted with the other characters flailing around without her leadership.\n\nSpeaking of flailing around without Annalise, Frank and Bonnie are meeting. And Bonnie is telling Frank how suspicious that looks since she\u2019s Annalise\u2019s lawyer. Again, she\u2019s telling him this\u2026 while meeting him. Um. Okay. So. Why did she agree to this meeting again? I didn\u2019t even see anything that looked like vital information exchanged. Frank and Bonnie are as good at wasting each other\u2019s time as they are at wasting screen time at this point. Dope. Take your dickmatized ass home, Bonnie.\n\nWe go back to sad Laurel, who is pulling a Wes and obsessively going over a bunch of materials related to Wes\u2019s death\u2026 until a private investigator comes. This could be interesting\u2026 What is also interesting is that Laurel calls him Howard, and he asks her to call him \u201cHowie.\u201d So\u2026 At this point we have a grown ass Black woman named Meggy and a grown ass Black man named Howie. Got it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe return to Annalise\u2026 Who decides she\u2019s about to start playing hardball again. Yesss, Annalise. She starts up a letter to the attorney general\u2019s office saying that if they don\u2019t investigate A.D.A. Atwood\u2019s actions, she\u2019ll end up releasing information about the loss of the body, etc. In Attorney General Ingrid Peters\u2019s office, Annalise takes it as far a bringing up what it would do to Peters\u2019s reputation\u2026 Again, IN her office. Yikes. Attorney General Ingrid Peters is not about the bullshit, says she doesn\u2019t like threats, and Annalise doubles up on the bass in her voice and then leaves. Goddamn. I\u2019m glad to see Annalise making bold moves again, but she may be in over her head on this one. Atwood and\u2026 A.D.A.-whose-name-I-never-remember (Denver, Google reminds me) meet up with Bonnie and threaten her in retaliation\u2026 I wonder If this is aimed at Bonnie in particular? Either way, I\u2019m not particularly shook by them adding more threats to the equation. I\u2019m not convinced they have that all much left in the chamber.\n\nIncluded in the fallout from Annalise\u2019s trip to the attorney general\u2019s office is\u2026 Nate. Who is pissed. Again. And honestly, Annalise does sound a little na\u00efve on this one\u2014the attorney general would be making herself look bad if she investigated and found something that looked suspicious. Nate vocalizes what\u2019s been obvious in all Annalise\u2019s interactions this episode\u2014everyone thinks she\u2019s a joke now.\n\nWe quickly move forward to see how valid that accusation is\u2014Annalise has Oliver leak the information about Wes\u2019s missing body to the press. This is not before we see Oli looking at all Annalise\u2019s outgoing emails, below:\n\nAwww. The hangover thing with Eve is a cute little detail. And some of the other emails here are\u2026 interesting. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see more on that later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe information about Wes\u2019s lost body is out into the world, and in a rare moment of acting I actually enjoy from her, all Atwood can say is, \u201cThis bitch\u2026\u201d Poor Atwood. Looks like it is war. I still get the sense Annalise is in over her head a little bit, but at least it\u2019s getting interesting again.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurel\u2019s digging got her something\u2014apparently, the Mahoneys did a DNA test on Wes, which\u2026 I\u2019m surprised they hadn\u2019t done already? I don\u2019t know\u2014apparently, this is an important detail. I\u2019m still wondering who Wes called as \u201cChristophe.\u201d In any case, Annalise is pissed Laurel hired a PI and doesn\u2019t see a productive way to use the information. In one of her \u201cI TOLD YOU NOT TO FIND THIS OUT\u201d rampages, which you\u2019d think she\u2019d realize by now aren\u2019t all too productive for getting everyone to trust her, she angrily admits to everyone that the Mahoneys killed her baby years back\u2026 And Laurel tells her that Wes deserved better and storms out. Damn. Laurel might be the cast MVP for petty, emotionally devastating one-liners at this point.\n\nWe have a brief moment of Annalise nearly taking some of Bonnie\u2019s Vicodin, but she stops herself. Looks like we\u2019re on the edge of a whole new emotional spiral\u2026 Interestingly, a scene follows where Connor takes a bottle of beer from Michaela. Hmm. Annalise #2? She has been adamant about letting everyone know how much she\u2019s been keeping shit together. And as weirded out by Asher x Michaela as I\u2019ve been, it\u2019s been sort of interesting to see each of them as the other\u2019s moral compass\u2026 And infuriating to see Michaela refuse to think anything\u2019s wrong with Connor. Asher brings up something that\u2019s been bothering him\u2014Connor has been extra suspicious. Michaela, for some reason, doesn\u2019t really believe this, even though Asher presents a good point\u2014Connor keeps accusing Annalise, talking about plea deals, and generally acting like a whiny bitch. It\u2019s reaching the point where I\u2019m actually suspicious of Michaela to some extent, largely because I don\u2019t think her character is that na\u00efve. Speaking of Connor, he has a brief scene kicked off by him making a dead baby joke, so I have to believe at this point that the writers have made a game out of seeing how little chill they can give a character before making him an actual cartoon character. In that scene, we get Annalise\u2019s outgoing call records:\n\nIiiintersting.\n\nBonnie tries to comfort Laurel\u2014in the process, Bonnie mentions that she was a 1L when Annalise was pregnant, which is interesting only because I keep finding myself forgetting that she\u2019s an actual lawyer despite her best efforts to act like one. She also brings up abortion with Laurel, which, you know\u2014great timing there, Bonnie. Laurel is not happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other unhappy people news, Annalise gets a call from a furious Ingrid Peters, who has too much sense not to know Annalise was the one who leaked the information about Wes\u2019s body\u2026 Peters rejects Annalise\u2019s request for a grand jury investigation and says if Annalise keeps her shenanigans up, Peters will have her prosecutors go for not just life, but the death penalty\u2026 \u201cThat. Is what I call a threat.\u201d OOP. Peters got in that ass. Dial it on back a little bit, Anna Mae. Stressed Annalise is eyeing these drugs in Bonnie\u2019s medicine cabinet again\u2026 The Vicodin, some cough syrup\u2026 Is Annalise going to give up liquor for lean?\n\nIn another instance of what-the-fuck-are-you-thinking, Frank calls Bonnie\u2019s house, knowing he\u2019s recorded, and ultimately talks to (an almost totally silent) Annalise. Seriously\u2014in what universe is anyone supposed to believe he\u2019s not trying to take the fall for her? So suspicious. I guess the point is that everyone is a mess without her leadership, but\u2026 I truly need some competence to balance out all the wild and suspicious shit everyone has been up to.\n\nSpeaking of wild and suspicious shit, Annalise puts two and two together on President Hargrove\u2019s recent odd behavior and realizes she\u2019s been working with Atwood. I kind of wish Annalise had cussed her out instead of indignantly leaving, but I guess that wouldn\u2019t help her case much. Dah, well. So much for their weird little frenemyship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another hilarious instance of everyone being able to help Annalise more than Bonnie, Frank, defending himself (and actually impressing Annalise!), convinces a judge to grant a subpoena and turn over all Atwood\u2019s communications for the day of the fire and the resulting investigation. He also reveals Atwood\u2019s little relationship with Nate\u2014it looks like she ended up setting herself up by setting Nate up. Damn. Sucks to suck, Atwood. Frank, as he should be, is quite pleased with himself. If only Bonnie\u2019s ineffectual ass were in jail instead of him. Oddly, Denver is chewing Atwood out as if he didn\u2019t already know all of what happened\u2026 you\u2019re just mad y\u2019all got caught. And\u2026 Nate\u2019s off the hook! He\u2019s not mad at Annalise! GIVE ME NATE BODY, DAMMIT.\n\nIn a surprisingly touching scene, Annalise lets Laurel know that Wes\u2026 was cremated. Shit. Well, no chance of reexamining the body. Atwood was not fucking around. The scene Annalise and Laurel have is one of the most emotional and well-done recently in the show, with both getting into their feelings in a more complex way than all the flailing and screaming we\u2019ve seen in the show of late. The grieving process as written seemed overdone and grating before\u2014the shock, confusion, sadness, and anger in this scene was actually moving in comparison. YES for making me give a damn about these characters again!\n\nFinally\u2026 Asher and Bonnie point out the fact that Connor has been an annoying little asshole and outright accuse him of being the anonymous source\u2026 Even Michaela has to agree he\u2019s been doing the most. And\u2026 Uh oh. As Connor gets back home later, it looks like Oli found something suspicious, too: Connor actually checked his voicemail the night of the fire\u2026 and left his apartment way before it happened. RUH ROH. And sure enough\u2026 He was at the house\u2026 GIVING WES CPR. HOOOOOLY SHIT. Obviously, this brings up a lot of questions\u2026 Though it actually doesn\u2019t make me think Connor did it. If he did, it definitely wasn\u2019t on purpose. I\u2019m still confused about his behavior, though\u2014just guilt, maybe? Honestly, him asking to check into what Annalise did could just as easily cast more suspicion on him. And if he was in the house, he probably knows Annalise didn\u2019t do it. I also still don\u2019t want to make a judgment until I know exactly where Annalise\u2019s ass was that entire day\u2026 Especially since we keep finding out new people were in the house. Shit, next episode we\u2019re probably going to find out that I was in the house. As a matter of fact, we were ALL in the house. Maybe we all killed Wes. In any case, this episode was a little uneventful, relatively\u2026 they must have spent all their money on the finale.

Like, this is a fucking mess as a eulogy, but on the lowest of keys her whole speech was exactly how I feel about white people since Faygo Impeach got elected. Random crying white girl sad about\u2026 ??? \u201cIt\u2019s not your tragedy.\u201d Tell her, Laurel. (I\u2019m projecting.)

Turns out mama has occasional episodes of dementia\u2014daddy tries to reassure Annalise that she just makes stuff up sometimes, at which point Annalise lets him know mama actually did burn down the house and kill his brother years ago. Papa is stunned, and Annalise hits him with the classic \u201col\u2019 fool ass\u201d facial expression Black women have been shooting at clueless Black men for centuries upon centuries.\n\nWe go back to wandering, grieving Laurel, who finds Nate and guilts him into showing her Wes\u2019s body. Goodness. Everybody is shaming this man today. They open up the body bag to find\u2026 A nigga who is not Wes. WHO IS THIS NIGGA? We may never know. We probably won\u2019t. What we do know is that\u2026 they have no idea where Wes\u2019s body actually is. They lost the body. They. Lost. The. Damn. Body. Look\u2026 I\u2019m no forensics expert. But bodies are like\u2026 Kind of heavy. How does one not only mistakenly misplace a body, but put another body in its place without realizing the switch happened? Did they mix up Wes and this other dude? What perfect storm of logistical skill and pure foolery needs to happen for a whole entire body to be misplaced, particularly one central to a high-profile murder investigation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, Nate gets getting chewed out for taking Laurel to see the body in the first place by A.D.A. Renee Sexy-But-Can\u2019t-Actwood and\u2026 that other dude. I really do wish Atwood\u2019s acting were better. I really want to like her as an antagonist for Annalise. Bonnie finds out about the rogue corpse, and she thinks there\u2019s a silver lining: the loss of the body proves Annalise is being framed. I\u2026 am not a lawyer, but that sounds a little flimsy. Annalise, more focused on her mother than anything, seems to think so, too.\n\nAs she tries to put a plan in place for mama, Annalise has an argument with her daddy during visitation, and we get into some more of her familial trauma\u2014papa knew his brother was sexually abusing Annalise but seemed to be drinking/absent and ignored the reality of it, driving mama to burn the house and kill Annalise\u2019s uncle. I find some of Shonda\u2019s dips into race heavy-handed, but I actually like this one, in large part because it doesn\u2019t feel as forced as others\u2014the way the characters move into and out of silence around the past events feels genuine and brings up a lot of problems with how we deal with sexual assault in Black families. In any case, papa bullshits around it a little, but he also verbally puts a boot up Annalise\u2019s ass and tells her to get up and defend herself instead of wallowing. I could use more Roger Robinson reads in this show, truth be told. Instead, I get the anticlimax of Laurel and Frank being angsty at each other some more, and then Connor being angsty at everyone and reminding us that we don\u2019t know who killed Wes yet\u2026 Okay.\n\nAt the eventual meeting with the judge, Atwood is unable to come up with a better explanation than saying it\u2019s \u201can unfortunate clerical error.\u201d Um. That\u2019s a hell of a misfile, girl. Bonnie throws a Hail Mary and calls the loss of the body a \u201ccivil rights issue,\u201d and Atwood reacts with the same \u201cBish, whet?\u201d face everyone watching the show did. Bonnie is truly trying it. In one of the most comical cuts in the show so far, Bonnie asks for Annalise to be released on bail (again)\u2026 only for us to immediately cut to a scene of her saying the judge refused to release Annalise on bail. LOL. Bonnie\u2019s new plan is to try and get a new judge\u2026 I guess after that doesn\u2019t work, she can try to get a new set of state laws and maybe a new Constitution. Bonnie, girl, you\u2019ll get it one day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnnalise (who had clearly already phoned it in asking Bonnie for help in the first place) decides to stop moping and get out herself, taunting her cellmate into beating her ass. Um, well. That\u2019s certainly a plan. Proving that she can\u2019t succeed without Annalise\u2019s help, Bonnie finally gets Annalise out on bail with the threat that she\u2019ll release pictures of Annalise\u2019s beaten face to the press along with the aforementioned civil rights lawsuit. I guess Bonnie\u2019s unhealthy dependency streak will continue. Go figure. Annalise lies to mama about the charges getting dropped, so I guess that\u2019s all we\u2019ll see of Cicely for a while.\n\nThe last five minutes basically show all the characters losing their shit. Oli, having successfully lied to the police, is losing his. Connor rounds out their dysfunctional relationship with his clear cries for help that are more annoying than relatable at this point. Oh, and\u2026 Oli saved a copy of what he erased from Annalise\u2019s phone the night of the fire. RUH ROH.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t go an episode without the writers trying to make me give a fuck about Frank and Bonnie and whatever bullshit they have going on. So Frank calls Bonnie, and apparently, he fired Paper Boi because he was too competent. Jesus. Ugh. I want to know Paper Boi\u2019s backstory as an attorney! I want to see Paper Boi fighting crime. Paper Boi vs. the Forces of Evil. Make it happen, Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe end the episode with Atwood and Company meeting late one night\u2026 Apparently someone from the D.A.\u2019s office signed off on Wes\u2019s body being transferred to another morgue. They then pull out paperwork with Nate\u2019s signature\u2026 Looks like Nate is getting set up. Yikes. Seems like that sexual harassment threat can only go but so far. Maybe between this and mama\u2019s shaming, Nate will end up back on Team Annalise. Or maybe not\u2026 It looks like Nate\u2019s foray into Annalise\u2019s house the night of the fire led him right to\u2026 Wes. And the meeting looked tense. Nate keeps wondering if the autopsy said Wes was dead before the fire\u2026 HMMMM. Did Nate do it?! Honestly, I feel like probably not. But it would be interesting as hell. And with Nate\u2019s chest and abs making heartbreakingly few cameos lately, I could use interesting for him.", "keywords": ["bonnie", "murder", "season", "mama", "nate", "cry", "wes", "black", "laurel", "recap", "body", "12", "annalises", "episode", "paper", "annalise", "away"], "polarity": 0.044427782287157276, "subjectivity": 0.4527610930735932},

She\u2019s able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. That stuff is minutiae. It\u2019s not that important.\u201d\n\nThe biggest surprise of the night came when Denzel Washington won his first SAG Award for best actor for his role in Fences. Many people, including Washington, thought the award was going to Casey Affleck, and his speech reflected that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know, I am a God-fearing man. I\u2019m supposed to have faith, but I didn\u2019t have faith. God bless you all, all the other actors.

But I am prepared!\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s co-star in Fences, Viola Davis, made history when she became the first black woman to win five SAG Awards. Davis won in the best supporting actress in a motion picture category. Davis used her speech to thank Fences\u2019 playwright, August Wilson.\n\n\u201cWhat August did so beautifully is he honored the average man, who happened to be a man of color,\u201d she said at the podium. \u201cAnd sometimes we don\u2019t have to shake the world and move the world and create anything that is going to be in the history book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that we breathed and lived a life and was a god to our children, just that, means that we have a story and it deserves to be told,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe deserve to be in the canon of any\u2014in the center of any narrative that\u2019s written out there. And that\u2019s what August did. He elevated my father, my mother, my uncles who had eighth- and fifth-grade educations, and he just encapsulated them in history.\u201d\n\nThe final award of the night went to the cast of Hidden Figures, who also used the opportunity to speak about love prevailing, when they won for best movie ensemble.\n\n\n\nTaraji P. Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Octavia Spencer accepted the award, and Henson reminded people what happens when you come together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis story is about unity,\u201d Henson said. \u201cThis story is about what happens when we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race. We win. Love wins. Every time.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the awards show, the most poignant afterthoughts came from Davis when she spoke about inclusion and #OscarsSoWhite. According to Davis, she doesn\u2019t think that was the reason black people took home awards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of typecasting\u2014age, sex, color, dark-skinned, light-skinned,\u201d said Davis. \u201cResponse to OscarsSoWhite? No. I think that every nominee, from Naomie Harris to Octavia Spencer to Hidden Figures to Fences to Moonlight to Mahershala Ali, are up there because they deserve to be there. They\u2019re not there because of the color of their skin. They put in the work. So the answer to that is no.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also spoke about next month\u2019s Oscar and the \u201ctrend\u201d of diversity and inclusion.\n\n\u201cFeb. 27 is gonna come, and now what?\u201d Davis said. \u201cIs it just going to be a trend to talk about inclusion\u2014and I\u2019d rather say \u2018inclusion\u2019 than \u2018diversity\u2019\u2014or is it going to be a norm that we\u2019re all part of the narrative, that all of our stories deserve to be told, and that art indeed has to reflect life and our culture?

Wilson\u2019s masterful storytelling about a working-class family living in a historic Pittsburgh neighborhood and fighting for survival, personally and professionally, jumps off the screen under Washington\u2019s brilliant direction. Wilson\u2019s splendid storytelling blends perfectly with Washington\u2019s keen ability to capture the aesthetic and dramatic elements of the play while creating a visual representation of black life that is thoughtful, intense and cinematic.\n\nWashington has proved his directing chops before at the helm of films like Antwone Fisher, The Great Debaters and, now, Fences. Like Wilson, Washington has a profound ability to explore African-American life on-screen, including heavy topics like racism, economic disenfranchisement, sexism and familial dysfunction, in a way that is accessible to broad audiences while managing to privilege and preserve black culture and expression.\n\nSet in the 1950s, the film has Washington playing the lead character of Troy Maxson, a former Negro League baseball star who now works as a trash collector. The story opens up with Maxson, who has filed a complaint with the union because there are no black garbage truck drivers. Maxson explains that the job of the lifter is much more physically demanding than that of the driver, who checks off addresses, reads the paper, navigates through neighborhoods and is ostensibly paid more.\n\nViola Davis\u2019 performance as Rose, Maxson\u2019s doting wife, is staggering. Rose gives Troy as good as she gets through intense yet loving banter, hard work and commitment. The love the two share is on full display as they vacillate between serious and comical interactions while supporting each other in their day-to-day lives, however mundane or complicated they may be.\n\nIn an understated performance that steals the spotlight from Washington and Davis at times, Stephen Henderson plays Jim Bono, Troy\u2019s best friend, who serves as a sort of chorus figure, watching from the outside, weighing in with pearls of wisdom, yet still being very much an essential part of the narrative. Bono (as he is referred to in the play and film), who met Troy as a young man in prison, is as much a part of the family as Gabriel (referred to as Gabe in the film), Troy\u2019s brother, played splendidly by Mykelti Williamson, and Cory (Jovan Adepo), Rose and Troy\u2019s son, who\u2019s chasing a dream of playing football and learning that his main obstacle is not society or the low odds of success but his father, Troy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTroy is haunted by his mistreatment as a Negro League player by Major League Baseball and does not want his youngest son to suffer the same fate. Cory, who wants to be an athlete like his father more than anything, quickly learns that Troy is flawed and unforgiving, despite expecting forgiveness for the continued mistreatment of the family, which includes Lyons (Russell Hornsby), Troy\u2019s oldest son by another woman, who is a slick, aspiring musician. Lyons shows up on every payday with his hand out and arms swinging. Lyons\u2019 sly grin belies the anger he has for Troy, who missed his childhood while serving 15 years in prison for an unintended crime.\n\nWilliamson offers an endearing performance as Gabe, who is childlike because of a traumatic brain injury suffered in World War II. Gabe serves as the conscience of the family, living and loving on his own terms despite his injury. Even in his childlike mind, Gabe understands that there is something greater for us all and wants to make sure the Maxsons and the city of Pittsburgh know it. As Troy\u2019s son Cory finds his confidence and strength as a man, so does Adepo, whose acting stands up to Washington\u2019s performance in the second act.\n\nFences is rampant with symbolism, as Troy works on building a fence for Rose, first with Cory and then Bono. The home serves as a metaphor for the family, and the fence as a metaphor for decisions that affect the family. It becomes abundantly clear to audiences that you can have all the pieces needed for completing the fence, but if there isn\u2019t a real purpose or true commitment to the task at hand, then all of the bad things you\u2019re trying to keep out come right in and take a seat at your dining room table\u2014or, in this case, in Cory\u2019s bedroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatching the Maxson family unravel and attempt to rebuild after Troy does the unthinkable is hard to watch, but it's impossible to look away because of the complicated characters, magnetic performances, heart-stopping dialogue and truly splendid writing and direction. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen captures the Maxsons\u2019 move from hope to helplessness through vibrant imagery followed by muted tones reminiscent of character-driven films like A Raisin in the Sun (1961) and The Pawnbroker (1964).\n\nWashington\u2019s, Davis\u2019 and Henderson\u2019s reprisals of their superb 2010 Broadway performances, which earned Washington and Davis Tony Awards for best lead actor and actress, do not disappoint. Washington takes us on an episodic journey through love, pain, betrayal and redemption, and with such heavy topics, the audience will struggle through it. With performances that will literally take your breath away, Fences is a must-see film offering a timeless critique of a family trying to determine who should be on each side of the fence, one fence post at a time.\n\nFences hits theaters Christmas Day.

Her premise \u2014 and this is one several agents, authors, and editors agree with \u2014 was that the news coming out of Washington has been so bizarre and ridiculous and absurd that we (collectively) haven't had as much of a need to read fiction for entertainment. Also, the perpetual diarrhea stream of Trump-related stories has so dominated the news cycle that there isn't as much space for anything else.\n\n\n\nMonika Woods, a literary agent at Curtis Brown LTD, said that amid the rapid news cycle from fall of 2016 to early 2017, \u201cFiction writers were booked on \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 and they had to be rebooked and rebooked and rebooked. Even New York Times bestselling authors with books out in Fall 2016 struggled.\u201d Industry insiders noted that Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Here I Am and James Gleick\u2019s Time Travel: A History, for example, failed to meet sales expectations, even though both authors had their previous novels on the New York Times Bestsellers List. Sarah Bowlin, former editor at Henry Holt and current literary agent at Aevitas Creative Management, echoed Woods\u2019s thoughts, saying, \u201cWhen you have a news day of four different revelations, there\u2019s less room in a cultural conversation to talk about a debut or bestselling author.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Fortunately, this has resulted in a hypervisibility for Black and Brown writers, as, to quote Jerkins, \"the same identities that are being persecuted and demonized by the Trump administration are finding a warm welcome from an increasingly diverse literary audience that is eager to hear vulnerable voices.\")\n\nAnd then, literally seconds after I finished reading that, I clicked on and read Anthony Scaramucci's Mooch Eruption in The New Yorker, demonstratively proving the truth of everything Jerkins said. How the fuck are authors supposed to compete with a freakin White House communications director who leaks every fucking thing to a reporter while calling him to bitch about and expose leakers? I will never say or write anything more compelling and ridiculous and hilarious than \"I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\" (Which might actually be the way I introduce myself to people from now on. The next time someone shakes my hand and asks my name, I'm going to say \"I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\")\n\nAnyway, the most interesting revelation in the Mooch's rant (to me at least) is one I've had for months now. The men of the White House are obsessed with penises. Engrossed with wangs. Bedeviled with cocks. Bewitched with dicks. All of their policies and beliefs reflect this dick-obsessed world view. They want to ban transgender people from the military. And remove sex education from schools. And make gay men go through intensive reeducation camps, like learning how not to be gay is like training to be a yogi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, naturally, is par for the course for the right. As a working and active obsession with what people decide to do with their penises and vaginas is the second question on the conservative questionnaire, right after \"(fill in the blank) Lives Matter.\" But what makes the particular brand of charlatans and chickenhawks currently in the White House special (well, special-er) is that they're obsessed with each other's dick's too! There's Anthony Scaramucci sharing that Steve Bannon must have had his ribs removed or something and giving us the WORST. IMAGERY. EVER. There's \"Reince Penis\" \u2014 which apparently is the White House inner-sanctum nickname for Reince Priebus. (And what I will refer to him as for the rest of my days.) And there's The Ribless Wonder himself, Steve Bannon, who reportedly called Paul Ryan a \"limp dicked motherfucker\" and whose favorite insult is \"cuck\" \u2014 a transparently racist term derived from a porn genre where White husbands watch their wives have sex with well-endowed Black men. These men have balls on the brain! Cock on the conscience! Their medulla oblongatas are peaking with peckers!\n\nOf course, there are many possible reasons for their wang infatuations. Including one that reminds me of the time my inspection stickers were expired and I rode dirty for like three weeks and, because I was so self-conscious about my own substandard sticker, suddenly became obsessed with everyone else's. I had severe inspection sticker envy. And maybe they're obsessed with dicks because they're dicks themselves. Sentient penises with crackling foreskins writing policy and enacting laws. (No one has looked more like an 80-year-old's, swinging-happy-and-free-in-the-YMCA-locker-room flaccid wang than Steve Bannon.)\n\nWho knows?

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face. In a since-deleted post entitled \u201cPORTRAIT PERVERSION\u201d published today on his blog, an author mysteriously dubbed \u201cHannity Staff\u201d writes:\n\nControversy surrounding Kehinde Wiley\u2019s wildly non-traditional portrait of the Commander-in-Chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling; with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique -concealing images of sperm within his paintings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for more explanation than that, you will not find it in the article, which is still available to read via cache. It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face.

We wish her the best in future endeavors and are grateful for her service.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sanders tends to lead her contentious White House press briefings with the mantra \u201cI\u2019m gonna huff and puff and blow the FAKE NEWS media away with my lies.\u201d So why would I believe any of her bullshit now?\n\n\n\nCertainly not when more plausible scenarios have been presented before me like those from New York Times reporter Yamiche Alcindor. Although Alcindor notes that a White House source is disputing that claim, other outlets like the Wall Street Journal are, too, reporting that Omarosa was \u201cphysically dragged and escorted off the campus.\u201d As are reporters like American Urban Radio Network\u2019s April Ryan, whom if you recall, is a former friend of Omarosa\u2019s and accused The Apprentice alum of trying to \u201cphysically intimidate her\u201d following a rift.\n\n\n\nI can definitely see Omarosa cursing out John Kelly. And considering his treatment of black women recently, he\u2019s probably thanking White Jesus and White Santa that he has rid himself of her. There have been reports of Kelly not exactly enjoying Omarosa being around. In fact, it was those \u201cmounting tensions\u201d with Kelly that\u2019s allegedly led to her dismissal guised as a resignation\u2014which explains previous stories of her being the most \u201cdespised person in the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just have one question for Omarosa: Was it worth it, sis?\n\nC\u2019mon: Omarosa wanted a title and she aligned herself with a racist to get it.\n\nIn July 2016, Omarosa officially joined the Trump campaign as director of African-American outreach. No one, especially not someone like her who spent time at the White House in the 1990s, actually believed that this astonishingly stupid man with no government experience was primed to run the nation, even if his delusions convinced him otherwise. Yes, she and Trump worked together when she was a cast member on The Apprentice and he served as a producer of her old TV One dating show The Ultimate Merger, but c\u2019mon: Omarosa wanted a title and she aligned herself with a racist to get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter whatever rapport they may have had, the reality is Omarosa was a black woman working with a white supremacist who cozied up to other white supremacists and has long proven himself to be a disloyal narcissist. How did she expect this to end?\n\nOf course she had to be dragged out of the place. She sacrificed what little reputation she had as a pastor and a woman with a PhD to work with the village idiot and his band of sheetless Klansmen. Unfortunately, while she did earn the title \u201cassistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison\u201d and a salary of $179,700 (the maximum salary for any White House staffer), what does she have to show for it?\n\nShe\u2019s been clowned for finally getting a job and then mocked for no one knowing what she does with her job. Any reporting about her job is mostly related to black Republicans hating her (all 14 of them, I guess) and get a meaningless executive order tied to HBCUs signed. Oh wait, we found out she brought her homegirls to the White House for a bridal shower and got shut down by folks curious about the activities of someone who barely seems to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Omarosa has been silent while Sweet Potato Saddam has attacked black women such as ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill, Rep. Frederica Wilson, and Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson. She\u2019s been silent through her boss\u2019 thinly-veiled racist attacks on NFL players and their right to protest systemic racism he and his administration help perpetuate.\n\nJust imagine Omarosa trying to roll up at the next Essence festival.\n\nIn sum, black people hate the president more than ever, and after being awarded with a job title at The White House for purported \u201cloyalty,\u201d Omarosa had her black ass allegedly dragged out of The White House. Speaking of \u201cThe Blacks\u201d as her now ex-boss likes to call us, she is forever tainted. Perhaps some might forgive her, but most of us will not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust imagine Omarosa trying to roll up at the next Essence festival. They\u2019re going to have to hold various aunties back from throwing crawfish tails at her head for this betrayal. Same goes for the Soul Train Awards, the BET Awards, or anywhere else her red carpet loving self tries to show up at. Hell, Omarosa will probably have to duck \u201cthe saints\u201d at The Stellar Awards, too, who can\u2019t wait to call her everything but a child of God in the name of Jesus. The same goes for conferences, too, given she showed up at this year\u2019s NABJ Conference ready to knuck and buck and fight with veteran news anchor Ed Gordon over questions of her aligning herself with that apricot-hued bigot.\n\n\n\nFor those who might bring up Kanye West, let me say that one, I haven\u2019t forgotten and shade him accordingly, and two, Omarosa didn\u2019t drop Late Registration. Likewise, I stopped paying Steve Harvey a lot of mind, but even he was smart enough to try and backtrack. No, Omarosa is more like the political equivalent of Mean Mary (Tina Campbell) of Mary Mary: stubborn, smug, and nasty about her support of the president and anyone who questions her over it.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what Omarosa is going to do next, but it couldn\u2019t have been all worth it.

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.\n\nHolmes calls the children of interracial marriage born between 1960 and 1985 \u201cthe Loving Generation,\u201d though where I\u2019m from, we just call us mixed. Or black. Mostly black. Or \u201cYou know you black, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have quite a few qualms about the piece, especially as a mixed person who identifies as black whose picture is included in the actual op-ed\u2014which, petty or not, makes me feel as if I co-signed the opinions and perspective. I did not. All of us who are pictured in the op-ed are also part of a supplement to the documentary series. I can\u2019t speak for anybody else involved, but I took issue with much of the op-ed because our experiences as mixed people are varied in a way that the piece mutes.\n\n1. I HATE the title. \u201cBlack With (Some) White Privilege\u201d conjures up that time Very Smart Brotha\u2019s own Damon Young wrote \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People..\u201d I got why folks hated that title then (even if I agreed in principle with his argument), and I hate this even more. Damon\u2019s piece stated that male privilege exists and that black males have some privilege by virtue of being male. THIS piece alleges that mixed kids exercise some sort of white privilege by virtue of having a white parent. I think this entire premise is flawed; it is ENTIRELY circumstantial. She\u2019s somehow conflating colorism with proximity to whiteness, and they\u2019re two entirely different things.\n\nYou can be light-skinned with two black parents and receive the same benefits from lightness as a person who is mixed. And what if you\u2019re a dark-skinned mixed person\u2014somebody whose background is entirely impossible to tell from skin tone\u2014and receive no \u201cbenefits\u201d? Then what? Do you still have some white privilege because of your white parent? Like, do they need to show up to prove it? Maybe you just can\u2019t use it in person, only on paper?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I don\u2019t like this idea that there was some overarching political decision that so many black-and-white couples made after the Supreme Court decision to somehow stick it (no pun intended) to white supremacy by creating mixed children. While I\u2019m sure that some white folks absolutely rebelled in the form of their bedroom decisions, and some black folks took that opportunity, do we really believe that people are thinking about a Supreme Court decision when they meet and go through life together? I doubt it. If there\u2019s any proximity argument, I think this is where it exists. Most of these relationships\u2014whether married or not\u2014were born of desire, love and actual proximity.\n\n3. This passage:\n\nHow does having one white parent change that \u201ctwice as good\u201d calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how you have an idea, then you find ideas to support it even if holes can be shot through it? So there are more mixed people than you\u2019d expect in the \u201cleaders and luminaries\u201d category. OK. Holmes points out several at the beginning of the piece, namely actors, politicos, entertainers, athletes, etc.\n\nFor some, in particular entertainers and politicos, it would be asinine to suggest that their skin tone\u2014folks like Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Halle Berry\u2014doesn\u2019t play a role in their success; their being mixed also contributed to their skin tone, of course. Carey may be an outlier because of her once-in-a-lifetime talent (the same with Derek Jeter and Jason Kidd, also name-checked in the article). But proximity to whiteness didn\u2019t help them out as much as their complexion. And how do you reconcile that with folks like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna (and, hell, Muhammad Ali) who are (or was) light-skinned with two black parents? Are they just otherworldly talents? What about their white proximity?\n\n4. Then this passage:\n\nSometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not proximity, it\u2019s access to white people that begets other access to white people and the white power structure. I\u2019m connected to white people, so other white folks can tell and thus make an easier pathway toward success. Which, again, works if you can tell that a person is mixed and thus make a conscious decision because of it.\n\nWhat about the rest of us who aren\u2019t that easily discernible as mixed? What about our success? Not all heroes wear capes, and not all mixed people look like Meghan Markle. Or Vanessa Williams. Some of us actually aren\u2019t that noticeable and are considered light-skinned black folks by society writ large until we show up with or tell you we have a white parent. Doors don\u2019t open at that point either, by the way.\n\n5. And this:\n\nIt\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree that President Barack Obama\u2019s proximity to whiteness absolutely helped shape his worldview, and being around white people who loved him unequivocally was a boon for him. Did that make him believe he could be the first black president? Eh. My black parents made me believe that I could, too. But being president seems like a terrible job, so I\u2019ve never had the smallest of inklings to want to go down that road. Now, I suppose the question is, did I actually think that I could? Whereas maybe Obama always believed it with his whole heart? That\u2019s a legit question.\n\n6. Holy mother of God:\n\nI knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness \u2014 and my own perception and self-consciousness of it \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the foreground. What I didn\u2019t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I\u2019d accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m mixed\u2014my mother is a white woman\u2014and I have never moved around white people with relative ease, though I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means, either. In fact, short of my white mother, grandmother and stepfather, I am rarely around whiteness. I live in predominantly black cities and went to an HBCU and could literally put \u201cprofessional black person\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without a hint of comedy. I think most folks would call me successful, so how would we qualify that success? And what about dark-skinned black people who move with ease around white people?\n\n7. For heaven\u2019s sake:\n\nTurns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. \u201cAt my job, there\u2019s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, is that because there\u2019s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting promotions and why we\u2019re moving forward?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can\u2019t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love my mother, who is white. We do nothing but argue and have nothing in common. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m just an exception to this whole mixed life that others manage to live.\n\n8. Yep:\n\nThe writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told \u201cThe Loving Generation\u201d director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. \u201cOur ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,\u201d she said. She wonders, however, what the return is \u2014 that is, where do we go from here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed-race fluidity? What is that? Is that a thing? (It\u2019s not.) I\u2019m mixed and I view life through a very, very black-perspective lens. Because that\u2019s my life; I\u2019m black. How do you even see things with a white perspective? What is that? I\u2019m REALLY asking. \u201cMixed-race fluidity\u201d implies that you have some choices and can move easily between worlds. I don\u2019t care to do that, but in my experiences, that\u2019s not a thing. Being mixed just means that you don\u2019t choose black, not that you are somehow white. Because that\u2019s not a choice you actually have outside of the confines of your own mind and friends who let you cook.\n\n9. It goes on, but that\u2019s my larger issue with this piece: You can\u2019t decide that colorism isn\u2019t at the heart of whatever \u201cprivilege\u201d is being attributed to whiteness. Mixed people come in so many different shades that you can\u2019t always tell. Sure, some mixed folks are lighter and thus, perhaps, benefit in ways that other mixed folks may not, but that\u2019s not because they\u2019re mixed; it\u2019s because they\u2019re light-skinned.\n\nWhat about me? I\u2019m light-skinned, but I seriously doubt that there\u2019s some significant benefit I\u2019ve received, even though I\u2019d wager that I have received some by virtue of my less-than-threatening visage. Saying that black folks receive white privilege is problematic because it entirely DISCOUNTS light-skinned points, something we joke about in the black community that is a real thing. You don\u2019t need to be half-white for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The most I\u2019ve ever discussed being \u201cmixed\u201d has been over the past six months. My life has been a largely black one since I was a child. I was raised in a black household, with some summers spent with my white mom in quasi-rural Michigan, where I was always aware of my blackness. Articles such as this push me further into the belief that my parents really did me a solid by not giving me a choice or considering me to be mixed in order to make sure I honored both of my parents. I am able to do so without trying to claim some racial connection that white people have spent centuries trying to remove from me.\n\nPlus, why would I want that? I can love my white mother and be black. But more important, to me, it\u2019s REALLY OK to be black. I don\u2019t need to focus on the white proximity or the adjacency or the gaze. I can be equally successful as a black person who fully embraces that part of myself. There\u2019s a reason I never think about whether my being mixed is partially responsible for my success\u2014I don\u2019t make it a thing. I don\u2019t allow others to focus on it. It\u2019s why I not only get to go to the cookout, but I can also bring macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can acknowledge that I receive some benefits because I\u2019m light-skinned\u2014because I am. I also have the wherewithal to acknowledge that my black parents (and sometimes, ironically, my white mother) raised a black man who is comfortable with his accomplishments, without also feeling as if the whiteness in my veins that nobody knows exists is the reason for those accomplishments. That\u2019s my beef with the piece and its centering so much whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause it really is OK to black.", "keywords": ["white", "proximity", "thoughts", "anna", "folks", "york", "mixed", "oped", "im", "black", "holmes", "whiteness", "thats", "privilege", "dont", "times"], "polarity": 0.08471439626681555, "subjectivity": 0.38245688451333604},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\u201d the former president said as the audience chuckled.\n\nBarack Obama was painted sitting on a wooden chair among dense foliage with pops of colorful flowers. That was a purposeful touch by artist Wiley, who noted that some of the flowers carry special meaning to the president and his journey through life. The chrysanthemums give a nod to Chicago, the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where the President grew up, and of course the African blue lilies give nod to his Kenyan heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ability to be the first African American to paint the first African American President of the United States; it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI was humbled by this invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President I thank you for giving me a chance, and I thank you for giving this nation a chance to experience your splendor on a global scale,\u201d the artist added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newest additions to the gallery will be on view to the public beginning Feb. 13.", "keywords": ["president", "barack", "official", "michelle", "told", "shining", "history", "artist", "black", "obama", "portrait", "obamas", "african", "wiley", "moment", "using", "unveiling"], "polarity": 0.15363906926406928, "subjectivity": 0.39663419913419906},

It\u2019s the job of the other side of the aisle to sit there, hands crossed and brows furrowed like they\u2019re lactose-intolerant and just ate three soft serve cones from McDonald\u2019s because they got really excited that the machine was working.\n\nOf course, if he\u2019d ever watched one of these things before, he\u2019d know that.\n\nIn fact, if he had watched a certain speech to a joint session of Congress, let\u2019s say in 2009, when President Barack Obama was delivering it, he would know that icy silence was a step up from yelling, \u201cYou lie!\u201d\u2014as Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) did.\n\nThen, Wilson called his outburst a \u201clack of civility.\u201d And the White House, through then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accepted Wilson\u2019s later apology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can disagree without being disagreeable,\u201d Emanuel reportedly told Wilson.\n\nAs flippant as Trump is about categorizing his enemies as treasonous, and as obvious as it is to a layperson that this dotard is working off the combined triggers of the Russia investigation, the diving stock market (whose gains he just took credit for about a week ago) and some double-cheeseburger meat sweats, it\u2019s important to remember that these words have meaning\u2014particularly to his base.\n\nCalling one\u2019s enemies un-American has been a standard line among a portion of the GOP for some time now, but it\u2019s been such a go-to tactic for Trump and his team that it\u2019s become borderline unremarkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the increasing normalcy of it all that ought to have us shook.\n\nAt this rate, if Trump keeps tearing pages out of the Little Authoritarian\u2019s Guidebook to Subverting Democracy, there\u2019ll be nothing but the binding left.\n\n", "keywords": ["treasonous", "president", "know", "trump", "clapping", "little", "unamerican", "watched", "really", "sotu", "feelings", "treason", "hed", "wilson", "democrats"], "polarity": 0.050580163883735305, "subjectivity": 0.49327088916374634},

His first piece in the HLR was on marijuana, which he concedes has had a vast effect on the black community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy goal with the piece was simply to provide another perspective on the current legalization debates, which I felt haven\u2019t been reckoning enough with the harms done by prohibition, particularly to poor communities and communities of color,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cGiven that I think prohibition has proven a massive injustice, I think it\u2019s necessary to repair those harms with the wealth generated by legalization.

He was 78. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cBra Hugh, as he was affectionately known, opened many doors for me in South Africa and across the continent. He placed me on the front row of African history and culture.\n\n\u201cHe helped me gain access to Nelson Mandela and other South African government officials, business people, and of course, a plethora of artists and musicians.\n\n\u201cI remember while researching the book, we spent hours in Witbank, the township near Pretoria, where he was born. Bra Hugh wanted me to feel and understand the rituals and nuances of his upbringing. I remember standing with him on the dusty railroad tracks in the township gaining a deeper understanding of his soul-stirring song, \u2018Stimela\u2019 \u201c (video). That song is about the life of coal miners from southern and central Africa conscripted to work for long hours and little pay in unhealthy South African mines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn another afternoon he was driving me through Alexandria Township when he stopped his sedan, pulled out his horn and began serenading the neighbors. He introduced me to Miriam Makeba, who took me into her confidence, cooked dinner for me on many occasions, and shared stories over the years about her anti-Apartheid work in the [States]. His sister Barbara [Masekela], South Africa\u2019s Ambassador to Washington, D.C. in the 1990s, was another source for details and good conversation.\u201d Masekela and Makeba married in 1964, but divorced after two years.\n\nRussonello added in his obituary, \u201cMr. Masekela came to the forefront of his country\u2019s music scene in the 1950s, when he became a pioneer of South African jazz as a member of the Jazz Epistles, a bebop sextet that included the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim and other future stars. After a move to the United States in 1960, he won international acclaim and carried the mantle of his country\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\n\u201cHis biggest hit was \u2018Grazing in the Grass,\u2019 a peppy instrumental from 1968 with a twirling trumpet hook and a jangly cowbell rhythm. In the 1980s, as the struggle against apartheid hit a fever pitch, he worked often with fellow expatriate musicians, and with others from different African nations. On songs like \u2018Stimela (Coal Train),\u2019 \u2018Mace and Grenades\u2019 and the anthem \u2018Mandela (Bring Him Back Home),\u2019 he played spiraling, plump-toned trumpet lines and sang of fortitude and resisting oppression in a gravelly tenor, landing somewhere between a storyteller\u2019s incantation and a folk singer\u2019s croon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the 1970s and \u201880s, he collaborated with musicians across sub-Saharan Africa, constantly expanding his style to accommodate a range of traditions. ...\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Roland Martin on TVOne\u2019s News One Now (video), Masekela bemoaned the lack of respect for black and African history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Africa, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been convinced that our heritage is barbaric, it\u2019s savage, it\u2019s primitive, it\u2019s heathen, it\u2019s pagan. And we\u2019ve bought that, so we celebrate other cultures instead and put ourselves into other cultures and pushed our heritage to the side. We can\u2019t even remember Motown, it\u2019s a little example. . . .\n\n\u201cI was talking to somebody in the dressing room, and I said like, if you look at the British, when Kate and William were getting married, they showed us like their heritage from thousands of years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201c . . . Some of us can\u2019t even remember the Underground Railroad or Harriet Tubman. You can ask an adult today, what\u2019s the Underground Railroad? . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so convinced that our heritage is backward and we are ashamed of it and as a result, we have nothing to sell, and so we are consumers. And so like, just on hair alone, we spent $100 billion a year, and the men are wearing that hair vicariously. I believe that if you\u2019re a society that doesn\u2019t know where it comes from, you\u2019re a society that isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cHugh and I began discussing jump-starting his memoir project in 1995. He had piles of legal pad handwritten notes from an earlier effort with Quincy Troupe. It took nine years, but we got it done! \u2018Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela\u2019 was published by Crown in April 2004. Jacana Publishers released the South Africa edition in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe worked on the book everywhere...at his farm in South Africa, my house in South Africa, my townhouse in Oxford, MS, when I was teaching at Ole Miss, and in hotel rooms in New York in between his gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was in the 8th grade when I first heard \u2018Grazing in the Grass\u2019 in 1968. That\u2019s when his music began to influence me. I met Hugh 10 years later in 1978, when I was a photo intern at Jet [m]agazine in Chicago. I went to cover a concert of his with Herb Alpert. They were performing at the Park West Club on Chicago\u2019s north side.\n\n\u201cMy 1995 Howard University doctoral dissertation, which explored African American kinship ties with South Africans and the Anti-Apartheid Movement, laid the research groundwork for Still Grazing.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 video interview, Cheers said he was planning a photo book, \u201cHugh Masekela: An Illustrated Life,\u201d to be published in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was still in development with the picture book concept with Bra Hugh and his staff,\u201d Cheers messaged Tuesday. \u201cWe tabled those plans when his health challenges began taking a toll in 2016. I spent time with Masekela last August in South Africa. We communicated via text during the fall.\u201d\n\nThe legendary musician died in Johannesburg on Tuesday after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer.\n\nThe family said in a statement, \u201cWe will, in due course, release details of memorial and burial services. Hugh Masekela was someone who always engaged robustly with the press on musical and social and political issues. We laud the press for respecting his privacy through his convalescence and during this, our time of grief. . . . \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobin Denselow, the Guardian: Hugh Masekela obituary\n\nHugh Masekela official site\n\nObama-Farrakhan Photo Published for First Time\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was during a mid-2005 Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) meeting on Capitol Hill when award-winning journalist Askia Muhammad captured one of the most significant photos of his career,\u201d Hazel Trice Edney reported Saturday for her TriceEdneyWire.\n\n\n\n\u201cMuhammad had doggedly covered then Chicago Sen. Barack Obama since he \u2018first laid eyes on him\u2019 at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Now, here was the Senator in a warm conversation with constituent and fellow Chicagoan Minister Louis Farrakhan. As leader of the Nation of Islam, Farrakhan is another star in Black America, but one whose name is synonymous with controversy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasting no time, Muhammad snapped the news photo. But moments later, he faced a dilemma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cObama had already become the darling of national Democratic politics. And the scent of a presidential run was strong.\n\n\u201cMuhammad and others almost immediately realized that the public release of this photo could mean major trouble down the road. Mainly because of bigotry and fear-mongering, the public release of that photo could doom America\u2019s chances of electing Obama as its first black president.\n\n\u201cMuhammad had not even left the scene when he received a call and the photo was being summoned by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Muhammad ultimately surrendered the disk to Minister Farrakhan\u2019s chief of staff. And it remained one of America\u2019s best hidden secrets for the next 12 years. ...\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe kept a copy for himself, however.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, more than a decade later, the glowing photograph of now former President Barack Obama and Minister Louis Farrakhan has been published in a book by Muhammad to be released Jan. 31 - \u2018The Autobiography of Charles 67X\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlacks, Latinos Cite CNN for Objectivity on Cable\n\nBlacks and Hispanics choose CNN as the news source \u201cbelieved to be objective,\u201d while whites favored Fox News, according to a survey from the Gallup Organization and the Knight Foundation discussed Tuesday.\n\nThe pollsters asked respondents to choose among Fox News, CNN, NPR, local news (nonspecific), BBC, MSNBC, \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d NBC News, the New York Times and ABC News.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhites chose Fox News, 29 percent to 10 percent each for CNN and NPR; blacks picked CNN, 28 percent to 9 percent for MSNBC and 8 percent for local news (Fox garnered 6 percent). Hispanics chose CNN, 21 percent, with 14 percent for Fox News. The other outlets were 7 percent and under.\n\nThe findings came in an overall study that concluded, \u201cAmericans believe the news media have an important role to play in democracy, particularly in terms of informing the public, yet they do not believe the media are fulfilling that role.\u201d It also concluded, \u201cAmericans\u2019 perceptions of the news media are generally negative, and their perceptions of bias have grown considerably from a generation ago. A majority cannot name an objective news source.\u201d\n\nHowever, the survey found African Americans, and to some degree Hispanics, on the other side of these issues, with respondents identifying as Republicans and/or white taking the opposing position. Blacks, Hispanics and Democrats expressed more positive views of the news media than did whites, independents and Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CNN finding is surprising in that MSNBC released Nielsen ratings on Jan. 8 that showed MSNBC finishing 2017 as the No. 1 network for all of cable in African American viewership for prime time (Monday through Friday, 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.). \u201cMSNBC delivered 483,096 African-American viewers, ahead of CNN, VH1, ESPN, OWN, TNT and BET,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong other results, the report said, \u201ca majority of blacks, 55%, rely on TV or radio talk shows to stay up to date, compared with 42% of Hispanics, 40% of whites and 34% of Asians.\u201d\n\nThirty-four percent of blacks said they shared news stories online, compared with 32 percent of Hispanics, 30 percent of independents, 27 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 25 percent of whites. Fifty-seven percent of blacks felt that social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter played a positive role in the news environment, compared with 54 percent of Hispanics and 37 percent of whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe survey provided a backdrop for a two-hour program, \u201cAmericans & the Media: Sorting Fact from Fake News\u201d (transcript), Tuesday at the Washington Post, featuring journalists and media critics. In a discussion of the effect of Donald J. Trump on the press corps, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks said the term \u201cfake news\u201d is \u201cputting a target on our heads,\u201d repeating that she had received death threats.\n\nRyan spoke as news reports said that Brandon Griesemer, 19, of Novi, Mich., was arrested last week and now faces federal criminal charges following an FBI investigation alleging that he called CNN headquarters multiple times with threats to \u201cgun down\u201d employees of the network for producing \u201cfake news,\u201d as Allie Gross reported for the Detroit Free Press.\n\nPanelists such as Stephen F. Hayes, editor of the Weekly Standard, noted that Trump had elevated genuine \u201cfake news\u201d outlets - which traffic in conspiracy theories, by giving them access to White House press briefings. He cited Gateway Pundit as one such outfit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes also said that conservatives had complained for years about liberal bias in the media but were too often dismissed as \u201cthere they go again.\u201d Panelists faulted the blurring of lines between news and opinion and urged all news media to label clearly the differences. When Stephanie McCrummen of the Washington Post, a native of Alabama, went to interview residents to pursue the story of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s sexual misconduct, residents were surprised that she was there to listen and not assert her opinion, they said.\n\nTrump was portrayed as making his presidency a show, with Jay Rosen of New York University calling him a competing news organization.\n\nThe poll results were based on self-administered mail surveys with a random sample of 19,196 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. \u201cGallup oversampled households known to include harder-to-reach respondents, specifically blacks, Hispanics and young adults,\u201d the organization said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u2018Best Actor\u2019 Surprised by Lack of Black Reporters\n\n\u201cAfter the SAG Awards Jaleesa Lashay, a reporter from Blacktree TV, asked Sterling K. Brown one of the most difficult questions he probably had all night,\u201d Olivia Butler wrote Tuesday for TVOne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Are you aware of the disparities between the opportunities given to black journalists in comparison to our white counterparts?

I researched this because I, too, had a hard time believing it, but he\u2019s only 32 years old, and he grew up in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\n\n\nWhat we already know is that Miller has always been a political asshole. He\u2019s worked for some of the most divisive right-wing Congress members, including as a spokesperson for former Rep. Michele Bachmann, who believes that Donald Trump should deport people who won\u2019t swear allegiance to the United States, and for former Rep. John Shadegg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore coming over to the White House, Miller worked as a policy adviser and communications director for conservative Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who hates marijuana and black people, but not in that order.\n\nA New York Times profile on Miller shows that in his short 32 years on this earth, Miller has been gearing up to be in this White House with this administration his whole life\u2014because Miller has always been an asshole, dating as far back as when he was just 16.\n\nFrom the New York Times piece on Miller, here is what he thought about janitors and being forced to pick up his own trash:\n\nStanding behind the microphone before a hostile amphitheater crowd, Mr. Miller \u2014 then a 16-year-old candidate for a student government post, now a 32-year-old senior policy adviser to President Trump \u2014 steered quickly into an unlikely campaign plank: ensuring that the janitorial staff was really earning its money. \u201cAm I the only one,\u201d he asked, \u201cwho is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt his Santa Monica high school, Miller once did a patriotic striptease to reveal an American-flag T-shirt because that\u2019s how the right-wingers do it; they also want to have sex with the flag.\n\n\u201cMr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest,\u201d the New York Times reports.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t proof that Miller was grooming himself to sit next to one of the most powerful assholes in America, get this from the New York Times profile:\n\n[Miller] jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls\u2019 track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls\u2019 team from another school, not his own.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiller also allegedly called Jason Islas, who is Latino and was a junior high school friend of Miller\u2019s, to note why they could no longer be friends one year.\n\n\u201cHe gives me this litany of reasons,\u201d Islas told the Times. Miller noted that Islas was socially awkward and had acne. But his last reason was the most telling of who Miller would grow to become.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe mentioned my Latino heritage as one of the reasons,\u201d Islas said. \u201cI remember coming away from the conversation being like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, the White House press secretary\u2014who didn\u2019t go to school with Miller, so I\u2019m not sure how she knows what the hell she\u2019s talking about\u2014claims that Islas\u2019 version of events is \u201ca completely inaccurate characterization of their relationship, or lack thereof,\u201d disputing his recollection and suggesting that the two were more acquaintances than friends, the Times reports.\n\nAs a teen, Miller didn\u2019t like that the school had morning announcements in both English and Spanish. He wrote an editorial pondering why there were \u201cusually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school,\u201d according to the Times.\n\nHe also confronted Latino classmates when he heard them speaking Spanish.\n\n\u201cHe tended to make some of the Spanish-language stuff very personal,\u201d Moises Castillo, a classmate, told the Times. \u201cThere was a \u2018If you\u2019re not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think this is unequivocal proof that some assholes are made and others are born.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["white", "policy", "profile", "school", "life", "told", "york", "senior", "islas", "hes", "stephen", "miller", "house", "times"], "polarity": 0.04694696969696969, "subjectivity": 0.3956499518999518},

Of course, Kool-Aid was an ingredient. It was \u201cKool-Aid wine,\u201d after all, not \u201cHi-C wine\u201d or bitch-ass \u201cSunny Delight wine.\u201d But I could never determine what else was in there.\n\nWas it coconut oil? Pimento beans? Avocados? Old Bay? Pancake mix? Vanilla extract? Chicken stock? Melted Now and Laters?\n\nThe composition of the Kool-Aid wine continued to confound me. Until one day when I was 10 or 11 and I happened to be hiding in a living room closet with a clear view to the kitchen. And I finally was able to see what my dad used to make this exquisite and sublime refreshment.\n\nTwo packets of grape Kool-Aid. And a lemon.\n\nThat\u2019s it. There was nothing special at all about the Kool-Aid wine. It was just regular-ass Kool-Aid with a Giant Eagle lemon squeezed into it.

I did, however, have lemons and La Croix. So I decided to put both into the Ninja to see if I\u2019d be able to make some lemonade with a twist. And I did! Except the twist was, \u201cThis shit is fucking terrible and tastes like carbonated hot dog water.\u201d\n\nAnd, sometimes, like with my dad\u2019s Kool-Aid wine, the collaboration works.\n\nThe latter is true with the above painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice (Janet Jackson) and Lucky (Tupac) from the movie Poetic Justice. It shouldn\u2019t work. Especially since, when I first saw the painting, my initial thought was that this was a real-time rendering of how Justice and Lucky would look today, in 2018. It wasn\u2019t until the third or fourth viewing that I realized it was Michelle and Barack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich then made me realize that although I hadn\u2019t realized I needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life, I totally, absolutely, definitely needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life. And I only didn\u2019t know that I needed it because I didn\u2019t know it existed.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting, for 25 years now, for something to replace the metaphysical import of Kool-Aid wine.

Trump furthered his argument for pettiest president of all time Saturday morning when he presumably woke up, ate some leftover KFC for breakfast, watched cartoons for a few minutes and, as he sat under the complex machinery that applies his wig and spray tan, decided that he didn\u2019t want Stephen Curry at the White House.\n\nTrump used his Vienna-sausage-like Twitter fingers to disinvite Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry from the perfunctory trip to the White House usually made by the champions of the NBA.\n\nThat\u2019s right. While you were sleeping\u2014as the country stands on the brink of thermonuclear war; while affordable health care is about to be stripped from millions of Americans; as tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes and Godzilla (no, wait, that\u2019s Kanye) try to kill us\u2014the president of the United Gotdayum States of America is up early starting Twitter beefs.\n\nThis can\u2019t be life.\n\nUSA Today reports that Curry had this to say, earlier, about attending the White House: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. That\u2019s kind of the nucleus of my belief \u2026 (but) it\u2019s not just me going to the White House. If it was, this would be a pretty short conversation.\u201d When asked why he didn\u2019t want to go and what message he would be sending, Curry added:\n\n\u201cThat we don\u2019t stand for basically what our President has \u2013 the things that he\u2019s said and the things that he hasn\u2019t said in the right times, that we won\u2019t stand for it. And by acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country and what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye to. It\u2019s not just the act of not going there. There are things you have to do on the back end to actually push that message into motion. \u201c(Athletes are) all trying to do what we can. We\u2019re using our platorms, using our opportunities to shed light on that, so that\u2019s kind of where I stand on it. I don\u2019t think us not going to the White House is going to miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I know you\u2019re wondering how this all works. How Trump can disinvite Curry from the White House if he had already announced he wasn\u2019t going. It\u2019s like how you ask a certain girl out in college (oooh ... let\u2019s just hypothetically say her name was Sharonda James) and she turns you down, so you say, \u201cI didn\u2019t like her that much anyway.\u201d (You hear that, Sharonda?

The one with the trailer that broke the internet. The one with every single black actor in Hollywood not already cast on BET or TV One. The one directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), who is the most recognizable brother out of Oakland, Calif., not named Marshawn Lynch.\n\nWe saw the trailer. We laughed, we cried, we tried to make a time machine to get to February faster, and now we\u2019re sharing what we saw with you.\n\nWhile other people lined up for panel discussions about how to battle HIV in the Trump era or juvenile-justice reform, about 150 or so people lined up quietly, then filed into a small lecture hall to catch a glimpse of an imaginary African country that is about to completely transform Marvel superhero movies and Hollywood in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile some of the footage had been shown during Comicon this summer, this was the first time Black Panther footage would be seen by a 95 percent black audience. It was like a test screening for a movie we\u2019d already bought tickets for in our heads.\n\nModerator Jay Harris of ESPN introduced the star-studded panel, including director Coogler; actress Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead); Belinda Frazier, head of diversity and outreach at Disney; Nate Moore, the film\u2019s executive producer; and Rick Loverd, the director of Science and Entertainment Exchange at the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nSeriously, this was like the fantasy version of a black science-and-comic-nerd panel. After somberly reading the \u201cYou better not pirate this clip or Disney will hunt you down and everyone you\u2019ve ever loved\u201d speech, the lights were dimmed and the footage came up on-screen. Here are the highlights:\n\nThe trailer opens with King T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) in a black tailored suit walking into a red-carpeted casino with a Dora Milaje (the special all-female Wakandan royal security force) on each arm\u2014Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira). They\u2019re scoping out the place, talking through hidden microphones, looking for mercenary Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKlaue arrives with about 10 goons and starts bragging about what\u2019s in his pants (literally) and trying to negotiate a deal with Agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) for a briefcase holding a small sample of an ore called vibranium. One of his goons notices the Dora Milaje, the deal goes bad, bullets start flying, and everybody was kung fu fighting.\n\nThe action is kinetic, like a mixture of Coogler\u2019s fight scenes from Creed and the manic bullet ballets from Kingsman movies. Okoye and Nakia pull out spears and start fighting off henchmen, and T\u2019Challa is diving over tables while Klaue is shooting at Ross, T\u2019Challa and everyone else to make his escape. T\u2019Challa effortlessly makes a 20-foot leap into the upper balcony to chase after Klaue, only to have to dodge a slew of lasers as Klaue\u2019s hand transforms into a cannon of some kind. Then the scene ends.\n\nIn the next scene, T\u2019Challa is seen running through brightly lit city streets chasing an SUV. As he runs, his formal casino wear morphs around his body, seamlessly changing him into the Black Panther costume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther jumps on top of the fleeing SUV while you see Okoye pull out a gigantic golden spear and throw it in front of the vehicle, where it props up like a light post. The car smashes full speed into the spear. The spear holds its ground as the car flips over, and as it does, you see Black Panther leap from the top of the roof of the car, onto a nearby building, where he begins to run up the side\u2014like Spider-Man, but with better coordination.\n\nNext you see Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and T\u2019Challa prepare to battle in the sacred falls that have been shown in previous trailers. It\u2019s clear that in the movie, King T\u2019Challa will be challenged several times for leadership of Wakanda in ritual combat.\n\nAs T\u2019Challa and Killmonger square off, you see a red battle suit similar to Black Panther\u2019s form around Killmonger, and he leaps at the king. They fight, kicking, punching and swinging, before falling off a waterfall together, fighting all the way down into the cloudy waters below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn what appears to be another leadership challenge, M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), the leader of the White Gorilla Cult, steps out of a cave into the sacred lake to battle T\u2019Challa. He\u2019s much larger than Wakanda\u2019s king and wears a large mask that resembles an ape.\n\nAfter that, there are a series of quick scenes showing Black Panther dropping out of a airplane, a secret lab full of weapons and Black Panther suits being tested, more butt-kicking, and Michael B. Jordan scowling at T\u2019Challa.\n\nWhen the trailer ended, the room cheered, once we stopped wiping tears of absolute joy from our eyes. The panel seemed legitimately thrilled with their work: Gurira smiled like a kid who knows she\u2019s going to win the science fair, and Coogler was amped to answer questions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn audience member asked how technology derived from vibranium\u2014the rare ore found only in Wakanda that is part of everything from Captain America\u2019s shield to Ultron\u2019s robot army\u2014played a role in how they set up the film. Coogler compared Wakanda\u2019s relationship with vibranium to the Congo\u2019s relationship with the mineral coltan in the real world.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize, but coltan is one of the most vital minerals on planet Earth. Due to its unique properties, coltan is in every cellphone, electric car and missile-guidance system in the world, and it\u2019s pretty much only found in the Congo.\n\nThe Congo has been attacked, colonized and renamed several times over the years, but imagine if that didn\u2019t happen? Imagine if the Congolese discovered and capitalized on coltan technology, and managed to fight off Western colonization. How might that nation have evolved? Just how powerful would it have become?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the story of Wakanda, with super-smooth black royal superheroes thrown into the mix.\n\n\u201cWe asked ourselves, did the vibranium make Wakandans special, or were Wakandans already something special and made something of vibranium? We decided it was the Wakandans,\u201d said Coogler.\n\n\n\nPanelists talked about everything from vibranium\u2019s impact on Wakandan aeronautics to the cultural importance of seeing a movie about black people running a black country for little black children all over the world. (Black Panther will actually have a cross-nation release on the African continent, in addition to opening in the United States, a first for Disney films.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see,\u201d remarked panelist Rick Loverd, who pointed out that in the years after the Hunger Games films and Pixar\u2019s release of Brave, there was a 50 percent increase in girls signing up for archery classes.\n\nHe said he believes that Black Panther will spark interest in science and tech as well as travel to Africa in a whole generation of black Americans who\u2019ve never seen this kind of rich cultural depiction before.\n\nEverything about this movie screams international adventure, action and cultural resonance that few Marvel movies, if not movies, period, have ever accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait till February to get your Black Panther experience going, don\u2019t worry.

It has to continue the Marvel Cinematic Universe, be a good Spider-Man movie after three straight critical flops and introduce Marvel\u2019s new phase of casting \u201cdiversity.\u201d Does it succeed?\n\nNot really.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming is a fun movie, and a decent continuation of the series, but it lacks heart and is an utter fail for Marvel diversity. It\u2019s nice that Spider-Man comes home to a nongentrified neighborhood, but the movie goes out of its way to let you know that white guys are still running things.\n\n\n\nI think that in the movies we\u2019ve already made, and certainly in the movies that are coming up, it will be as inclusive a group of characters as one could want.\n\nThat is a quote from Marvel Studios grand poobah Kevin Feige to (ironically) Vulture magazine last year. Marvel has been under fire for some time from critics and, most importantly, fans for the lack of diversity in its cinematic universe. Racebending an 80-year-old World War II character like Nick Fury from a cigar-smoking white guy to a take-no-shit black guy in 2008 was a great move. In the subsequent eight years, though, Marvel went through almost 10 straight movies without a black woman having more than two lines, hardly had any Asian-American or Latino actors on-screen, and had a real bad case of \u201cwhitewashing.\u201d This despite the increasing dribbles of diversity that are occurring in core Marvel Comics.\n\nSpider-Man was supposed to be different.\n\nFor the last year, producers and directors were literally doing yoga stretches to pat themselves on the back about how \u201cdiverse\u201d the new Spider-Man would be, and how Peter Parker\u2019s world would look like the real world. Unfortunately, Homecoming only gives you that self-congratulatory, \u201cHey, we put a Black History Month flyer in the break room.

Peter comfortably speaks Spanish, and the hallways of his high school look like the United Nations. Most of Spider-Man\u2019s secondary villains, like the Shocker and the soon-to-be Scorpion, are played by well-known or at least recognizable actors of color. Moreover, even bit parts like the school principal and gym teacher are people of color, which helps flesh out the feeling that you are actually in a living, breathing, modern-day New York City. Nevertheless, as the characters get closer to Peter, the diversity becomes less impressive and more like window dressing.\n\nWhile most of the Vulture\u2019s henchmen are black and brown, Adrian Toomes himself (played with smoldering fury by Michael Keaton) is most definitely a \u201cregular blue-collar\u201d white guy, who the film makes a point of showing \u201cisn\u2019t very PC.\u201d Peter\u2019s high school tormentor Flash Thompson, played by Latino actor Tony Revolori, is good as a modern-day bully, a rich and smart jock who is more interested in putting Peter down than in putting his face in a locker, but he also doesn\u2019t play much of a role in this rebooted version of Peter\u2019s life.\n\nNed, Peter\u2019s best friend, played by Filipino actor Jacob Batalon, gets a lot of screen time, but his character is straight out of the Asian-Minority Sidekick to a White Hero handbook. Spit some funny lines, look amazed, live vicariously, and your greatest aspiration is to be the backup tech guy for the white hero. We literally saw this same role in Green Lantern.\n\nWhat makes Ned even more frustrating on the diversity front is that he\u2019s essentially lifted from Ganke, the best friend of Miles Morales, the black-Latino Spider-Man who is the main friendly neighborhood Spider-Man in the comics now. Even more frustrating, Donald Glover, who campaigned for the lead in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and who many fans thought would make a great Peter Parker or Miles Morales, steals the show in the few scenes he\u2019s in. He plays a character named Aaron Davis, who, in the comics, is actually Miles Morales\u2019 techno-thief uncle the Prowler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Spider-Man: Homecoming can use elements from Miles\u2019 life and even make reference to him with a huge star, but for some reason it just somehow couldn\u2019t find a way to cast the black guy as a Spider-Man lead. It\u2019s the movie equivalent of looking through a restaurant window and seeing the waiter gesticulate wildly that they\u2019re closed, but you damn well see that people are still walking in and ordering food: You can serve me; you just don\u2019t want to.\n\nArguably the biggest fail in Spider-Man: Homecoming are the two female leads: Laura Harrier as love interest Liz, and Zendaya playing red-headed Daria-esque \u201cMichelle\u201d\u2014who comic fans think might be you-know-who from the Spider-Man canon. While some people praise the casting of two women of color in Peter\u2019s life, it\u2019s actually still faux diversity and re-enforcing the status quo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Hollywood, comic book films\u2019 diversity still means giving white guys their choice of mixed-race or light-skinned, Hollywood-approved women of color as love interests. We see it in The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok with Tessa Thompson, etc. Change a white-girl comic character to a hot black woman? Barely a peep from fans. Consider casting a man or woman of color as the action or romantic lead? Utter chaos.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a critique of WOC getting jobs; that\u2019s a good thing. However, it just highlights the fact that hipster progressive-Hollywood racism allows for every sidekick, schoolteacher and love interest to be turned from white to minority in the name of \u201cdiversity,\u201d so long as it\u2019s always a straight white guy as the romantic lead driving the story\u2014even the villains. It also doesn\u2019t help that in Spider-Man: Homecoming, the relationship between Peter Parker and Liz (whose last name is \u201cAllen\u201d in the comics but who has no last name in the movie, for plot purposes) is absolutely, 100 percent chemistry-free.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming is a fun movie, but not one that will stick with you for long. It\u2019s significantly better on the diversity front than whitewashed Doctor Strange, or the minority-as-comedy-relief-sidekick-brigade antics of Ant-Man; and the references to race, history and culture by a group of smart high school kids are organic and believable in the film. But it falls way short of the fully integrated POC in Captain America: Civil War. It feels more like a mashup of a 1980s high school teen flick and Agent Cody Banks, with a few talking minority extras who are still revolving around the white-guy hero and villain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get that we\u2019re still a year away from Black Panther (lines already forming for the step and repeat with Barack, Michelle and DeRay), but Marvel can still do much better. Spider-Man\u2019s neighborhood may be more friendly, but as long as Marvel keeps centering white guys, he\u2019s still got the proportionate strength of a gentrifier.", "keywords": ["white", "spiderman", "peter", "school", "movie", "makes", "push", "marvel", "black", "diversity", "homecoming", "spideysense", "guy"], "polarity": 0.15554747905494173, "subjectivity": 0.4353137741197442},

Some also say it was the news breaking shortly before the election that there had been a BET party at the White House where Bell Biv DeVoe reunited to perform \u201cPoison.\u201d Admittedly, I am the only person I\u2019ve heard express this theory, but as sure as the FBI shot down Otis Redding\u2019s plane to break the spirit of black people in 1967, history will bear me out.\n\n\n\nOne year and some change after the Election, as the nation is on the brink of being engulfed by fascism and obliterated by nuclear war, we might consider other factors that led us here. In The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s magnum opus of Dominican history, a character opines that the cruelty that Dominicans show one another is the aftermath of having been under the rule of a murderous, racist dictator for 31 years. \u201cTen million Trujillos is all we are,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the matter of Donald Trump, I am suggesting the reverse. Maybe each of us brought this fate on ourselves by being too much like Trump. Not specifically the pathological-liar, rich, white developer person from Queens, N.Y., whose father attended a Ku Klux Klan rally, but Donald Trump, a transhistorical spirit of Absolute Wrongness. And we need to extract whatever\u2019s inside us that could possibly resemble that.\n\n1. Don\u2019t surround yourself exclusively with the same type of person.\n\nAlmost any picture of Donald Trump in President Barack Obama\u2019s old office looks the same: a crowd of shockingly unattractive elderly white men, from King White Walker Pence to Paul Mush-My-Face Ryan, celebrating a lunch of the bones of your child. Sometimes there\u2019s a wraithlike white woman in there. This is not just judging a book by its cover; read about Rex Tillerson and Steven Mnuchin, for example. These guys (and one or two ladies) are really the same: grotesquely wealthy, vitamin D-deficient, cruel, thoughtless and incompetent except in the game of fleecing other humans and raping the earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s you. Perhaps you feel your friends and acquaintances are a rich, diverse stew of politically progressive strivers, primarily black and middle-class, a couple of nice whites, but also those two Asian-American friends, one Korean, the other Chinese. But how does your group look to those two friends, the two nonblack ones whose names your other friends keep confusing?\n\nThe un-Trump move here is to expand your horizons. Get to know a straight-up Marxist who can tell you what the U.S. did to Chile in the 1980s. Familiarize yourself with the worldview of black lesbian anarchists. Get to know your local purveyor of halal treats or one of the exceedingly dapper elderly Ethiopian gentlemen who convene outside your local coffee shop. Imagine yourself in the Oval Office surrounded by something like America\u2014not majority white, but a full range of different skin colors and hairstyles and different religious head coverings. And the next time one of your black friends confuses Jen with Kimberly, tell them that shit is racist.\n\n2. Familiarize yourself with the Constitution.\n\nSince it seems doubtful that your president has not read this particular law of the land, you seriously need to brush up. For example, did you know that our Constitution gives the executive branch the right to \u201cput sulky and unpatriotic blackes [sic] in the stocks on a public square of his choice\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut since Donald Trump seems largely unaware of his job description and is employing a just-do\u2013it-and-let-the-American Civil Liberties Union-come-after-me approach, it would behoove you to know the articles and certainly the amendments\u2014the First, 13th and 14th being of particular interest. And, oh yes, the 25th.\n\n3. Re-evaluate your relationship with reality television.\n\nIt is indisputable that reality television, the utterly mediocre The Apprentice, elevated Trump to the highest post in the most powerful country in the world. This must be addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan you at least level-down your watching? Yes, I know, Cardi B, but thanks to reality television, the United States is flirting with the idea of nuclear war. Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d can be the soundtrack to the postnuclear ashes of our society.\n\nAnd you might think about that while re-evaluating your relationship to Twitter, as well, since those digital screens are DT\u2019s direct line to your soul. The words of a revolutionary (if sexist) bard come to mind: \u201cYo, why don\u2019t you just back up from the Twitter, read a book or something? Read about yourself, learn your culture; you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n4. Stop eating burned steak.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that Donald Trump has in common with a noncrazy black person is that he does not enjoy a bloody steak. Intriguingly, eating charred-crisp steak is a key cultural practice among roughly the same group of Americans once likeliest to eat boiled pig intestines. Who can say why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would hazard that as marginalized people, we did not want to be reminded of the proximity of meat (edible) to cow (animated, brown-eyed). Also, while chitlins have fallen from favor in my generation (leaving los boricuas y los mexicanos to take up the charge with tripe), it bears mentioning that chitlins are, in fact, very well cooked.\n\nAt any rate, the black community can be seen anywhere from fancy French bistros to Outback insisting on filet mignon the consistency and color of hockey pucks. But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s preference, it must not be ours. If this is a problem, give up steak. That meat actually is a mammal with soulful eyes, and the American appetite for consuming cow is helping to heat up the climate and destroy human life. Wait, maybe I should have started there. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. Give up the steak already, damn.\n\n5. Don\u2019t be a bragging pussy grabber.\n\nMentioned if there is something you do analogous to grabbing women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it on the Access Hollywood bus. For example, the other day at the library with my sons, I overheard a security guard complaining to another about having to pay child support. The second guard (here I\u2019m paraphrasing but absolutely not lying) said, \u201cMan, I got so many women pregnant, but none of them ever came to me looking for anything like that. None of them!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you may want to point a long, Obama-like finger at that admittedly African-American man and mutter a racist platitude about broken family values. Or you might want to give a sociological lecture about the aftermath of slave-family structure and contemporary assaults on black male masculinity. But that was this guy\u2019s grabbing of women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it to Billy Bush. Everyone has their version. Don\u2019t do yours.\n\n\n\n6. Prepare for public speaking engagements.\n\nRemember when Charlie Sheen had a public breakdown that got him fired from his multimillion-dollar job and decided to go on a 20-city tour titled, \u201cMy Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option\u201d? He launched in Detroit, primarily yelling a nonsensical string of catchphrases, including \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cwinning.\u201d I would bet my next check that many people who paid for those tickets went on to enjoy the live performances of Candidate Cheeto. But unlike Candidate Cheeto, who became president, Sheen was rightfully booed off the stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheen\u2019s \u201ctour\u201d was the rehearsal for this hot hell right here. Trump rambles off the top belligerently at press conferences, when some poor overworked Nazi aide probably poured hours into a teleprompter script; he does it in front of the U.N.; he does it at white power campaign rallies (why is this orange individual having campaign rallies? I mean, Pence I could see ... ); he does it in front of piles of manila folders; he gets up in front of cameras feeding satellites throughout the galaxy. He says whatever ignorant shit occurs to him, and when members of his death cult cheer, he says more of it. He improvises; he scats. It\u2019s not jazz, though; it\u2019s acid for the eyes, ears and soul.\n\nAnd it is why you and I must prepare. Maybe not to speak to millions about the fate of their health care or jobs or very existence, but to give a presentation to our co-workers, to a speech at our houses of worship or for an oral presentation for class (as a professor, I really beseech you on this one; I\u2019ve died during countless oral presentations). Maybe don\u2019t do what I\u2019ve seen every person who \u201cwrote their own\u201d wedding vows do, which was very obviously make up some shit right there at the altar. Let\u2019s prepare, and rehearse and say it because Trump wouldn\u2019t do it, and because it\u2019s classy and it\u2019s right.\n\n7. Let President Obama go.\n\nI have actually found it surprising the degree to which Donald Trump\u2019s agenda consists of pinpointing actions taken by the previous president, poking at them with his tiny, graceless hands and leaving orange, dusty smears. This appears to be his only vision beyond looting the treasury and whipping up frenzied crowds of the very people who will be crushed to dust by his policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy counsel here is for those of us who can\u2019t get our mind off Obama for different reasons. Maybe you spent the last eight years saying, \u201cNigga didn\u2019t do nuthin but drone, deport and talk down to black men,\u201d and somehow the rise of Trump makes you even angrier about Obama\u2019s failings. Or maybe when things seem apocalyptic, you go to a special place in your mind where Barack and Michelle invite you to dinner and then put on Anita Baker\u2019s greatest hits, offer you a cordial and ask if you want to slip into something more comfortable.\n\nBut, most likely, you\u2019re hoping that man will save you. I know I am. You can keep crying neoliberalism and calling him a good Republican, but Obama is undeniable. He got elected with an African name and a black Chicago wife, and he managed to keep all those black people safe in the White House for eight years. Do you know how many people tried to jump that fence and make him stop inviting rappers up in there?\n\nThough I partake in many of the left\u2019s critiques of him, I can\u2019t help respecting him more since learning that his lean shoulder was all that was holding the door against the Purge we are living now. It makes me want him to full-on lead the opposition in Candidate Obama \u201908 mode, but more like a cross between Che Guevara, Malcolm X, Shirley Chisholm and Harriet Tubman\u2019s shotgun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he\u2019s done.\n\nHe\u2019s gone to a beautiful house in Kalorama, a Washington, D.C., neighborhood that is also home to Jared and Ivanka. He emerges every now and then to spit a few bars about health care, but mainly he saves his hot 16s for million-dollar speaking engagements with billion-dollar white people all around the world.\n\nThis is not a dis. He\u2019s commissioning the first black painters ever to do the presidential portraits, one of them the relatively unknown Amy Sherald. I know he loves us, but we\u2019re running on fumes here. Gil Scott-Heron once said there\u2019s no such thing as a superman. We have to save ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing makes us more like Donald Trump than being obsessed with Donald Trump, passing his name back and forth like a virus. Even if it feels like he is personally torturing you, you cannot let him continue to enjoy having achieved his lifelong goal of being this country\u2019s, and maybe the world\u2019s, most mesmerizing spectacle. This is a piss-poor show, and he\u2019s watching us watching it while doing a lot of diddling with little appendages.\n\nMore importantly, watching, clicking, losing sleep and fuming about this individual is not what will stop him (or the congressional Republicans goodlordamighty, whom I haven\u2019t even addressed here) from disastrously altering human history. But do you know what will stop him (and them)\u2014I mean, besides being less like Trump? Great.

And listen, I know there was a whole plotline where she couldn\u2019t have sex or she would kill dudes by touching them. But I mean, couldn\u2019t she just get some gloves? I digress.\n\nMy previous convictions are irrelevant anyway. The next time someone asks me what superpower I want, my answer is just going to be \u201cSerena Williams.\u201d Because you simply cannot convince me she isn\u2019t a superhero at this point.\n\nWe all know that Serena is the best women's tennis player alive, and arguably the best of all time.

All while not even being a full-time professional athlete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t know is that when Serena isn\u2019t busy assaulting folks on the tennis court, she is out here fighting crime.\n\nSeriously. Serena busted out of a restaurant and chased down a petty thief without even batting an eye. I can\u2019t even bother to give the teenagers who insist on playing music out loud from their cell-phones during my daily morning anything more than a stinkeye. The cops certainly wouldn\u2019t have recovered it for her, even if she had Find My iPhone turned on (as I painfully learned the time my phone was stolen from a DSW). Props to her for saving the world from a 3,000 word Gawker article breaking down the leak of myriad of texts and voicemails of varying levels of simpitude and whiny passive-aggression of Aubrey Graham.*\n\nAt this point, do I even need to really make a case for Serena to be the next Avenger? I mean, what does Captain America do really besides be big and hot? We can kick him off the boat and bring some much needed diversity to the roster. Hulk doesn\u2019t even want to be an Avenger!

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you.

Gucci demanded that the retailer immediately stop selling any garments or accessories that bore Gucci\u2019s federally trademarked green-red-and-green or blue-red-and-blue striping patterns. Gucci has had trademark registrations on those striping patterns going back as far as 1988.\n\nForever 21 responded in June 2017 by filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, arguing:\n\nMany clothing and accessory items adorned with decorative stripes colored blue-red-blue or green-red-green are sold by countless third parties. ... The colors red, blue, and green, and stripe designs, are among the most favorite, popular and widely used colors and design features on clothing.\n\nThe company contended:\n\nGucci should not be allowed to claim that Gucci, alone, has a monopoly on all blue-red-blue and green-red-green striped clothing and accessory items\u201d and stated \u201cConsumers are not likely to be confused into believing the Striped Products sold in Forever 21\u2019s stores by Forever 21 are manufactured by, sponsored by, authorized by, or otherwise associated or affiliated with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForever 21 asked the court to cancel the at least nine different trademark registrations Gucci has over the patterns, terminate any pending applications for trademarks on the patterns and quash any potential trademark-infringement claims Gucci has against Forever 21.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Fernando M. Olguin sided with Forever 21, stating, \u201cForever 21\u2019s trademark cancellation non-infringement claims are viable\u201d and should be decided at trial.\n\nThe judge also rejected Gucci\u2019s request to dismiss Forever 21\u2019s trademark-cancellation claim, arguing that when consumers see those striping patterns, they do not automatically associate then with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaura Chapman, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin who is representing Forever 21 in the case, said in a statement to TFL Tuesday, \u201cForever 21 feels very strongly that Gucci improperly sought trademark registrations for these popular designs in a wrongful effort to monopolize them, and that these designs should be freely available for use by anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added that the case highlights more than 100 examples of other brands using that type of striping pattern, including Louis Vuitton, Versace, Valentino, St. John, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Gap and J. Crew, among many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cForever 21 believes Gucci\u2019s trademark registrations and applications should be cancelled by the court and looks forward to continuing to litigate this case to a fair and just result,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nA spokesman for Gucci said, \u201cIn an effort to distract from its own blatant infringements, Forever 21 is attempting to attack some of Gucci\u2019s most famous and iconic trademarks. This will not deter Gucci from pursuing its own claims against Forever 21 as part of its ongoing commitment to the vigorous protection of its valuable intellectual property rights and distinctive brand identity.\u201d\n\nGucci is an iconic brand with many years in the game, and putting aside what the judge in the case has said, I think we can all agree that Gucci\u2019s striping pattern is recognizable as being theirs and have been for many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I would agree that someone going into Forever 21 knows good and damn well that they aren\u2019t buying anything Gucci in a store with prices that low, and there would be no confusion about whether or not Gucci made the garments and accessories.\n\nThere is, however, something to be said for brand recognition. Even customers shopping in Forever 21 would agree that those stripes look like Gucci\u2019s; they just also know they aren\u2019t buying Gucci in Forever 21.", "keywords": ["forever", "red", "green", "21", "trademark", "stripes", "designs", "guccis", "registrations", "case", "patterns", "gucci", "striping"], "polarity": 0.20939393939393935, "subjectivity": 0.5103030303030303},

His rich legacy of entrepreneurship and possibility lives on to this day.\n\n\n\nHow appropriate, then, that his life is being memorialized in a PBS documentary, Pioneers: Reginald F. Lewis and the Making of a Billion Dollar Empire, during Black History Month. Lewis, before his untimely death in 1993 at age 50, seemingly made black history at every turn.\n\n\n\nLewis was the first African American ever to close an overseas leveraged buyout deal for $985 million. In addition to being the first black billion-dollar deal-maker, Lewis was the first African American to open a law firm on wall street; the first to be accepted to Harvard Law School without applying; and one of the first black men in America to have a museum named after him\u2014the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture in his native Baltimore.\n\n\n\nGeraldine Moriba, executive producer of the documentary, said that one thing that surprised her about Lewis was how so many people who didn\u2019t know him credit him with a stark influence on their lives.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve never met him and have no direct connection to him or any of his businesses have said to me they would not have gone into business or finance or banking if they had not heard his story,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I heard that again and again and again.\u201d\n\n\n\nLewis is what we now call a \u201cserial entrepreneur\u201d who started his first business at the age of 10 (a newspaper business where he had other children working for him AND he sold the business at a profit some years later). After attending the prestigious Dunbar High School in Baltimore where he was a star quarterback, he went on to attend an HBCU, Virginia State University, on a football scholarship.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his senior year, Lewis attended a summer program at Harvard Law funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and excelled to such an extent that at the end of the program he was invited to attend the law school, the only person in the 148-year history to be admitted before applying. Within two years of graduation, he started his own law firm focusing on corporate law and, according to a biography on the Lewis Museum\u2019s website, \u201chelped many minority-owned businesses secure badly needed capital using Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies (venture capital firms formed by corporations or foundations, operating under the aegis of the Small Business Administration).\u201d\n\n\n\nLoida Lewis, Reginald\u2019s widow and an incredible businessperson in her own right (she took over his business a year after his death and turned it around within one year), says this was the right time for his story to be told. \u201cIt\u2019s been many years, so anyone under 40 would not have heard of Mr. Lewis. They should know that an African American man accomplished so much. Always pushing the envelope,\u201d says Mrs. Lewis.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis legacy, he said it himself, was \u2018Keep going no matter what,\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cNot that he didn\u2019t have any failures; he had many failures. But he kept going.\u201d She says that after Lewis left Harvard Law and joined a prestigious law firm, they told him after two years he wasn\u2019t going to make partner. But he didn\u2019t let that stop him. He founded his own law firm and went on to make history with the deals he made, though she noted that he failed three times before his first big one\u2013but that he learned from each of those failures.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis\u2019 first successful deal was a $22.5-million leveraged buyout of the McCall Pattern Company, which he nursed back to health and led to the two most profitable years in the company\u2019s 113-year history. In the summer of 1987, Lewis sold McCall, making a $50 million profit.\n\n\n\nNext up was the deal that made him famous. The museum writes:\n\n\n\nIn October 1987, Reginald purchased the international division of Beatrice Foods, with holdings in 31 countries, which became known as TLC Beatrice International. At $985 million, the deal was the largest leveraged buyout at the time of overseas assets by an American company. As Chairman and CEO, he moved quickly to reposition the company, pay down the debt, and vastly increase the company\u2019s worth. By 1992, the company had sales of over $1.6 billion annually, and Reginald was sharing his time between his company\u2019s offices in New York and an office in Paris (most of the company\u2019s businesses were in Europe).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoida Lewis, who describes her late husband as \u201cvery dynamic, very intesnse, very driven, very ambitious, and very hardworking,\u201d also noted that as a husband and father (they had two children together, Leslie and Christina), he was \u201cvery loving, very tender, very sensitive.\u201d She admitted that he had a legendary temper but that he always made amends if he offended.\n\n\n\nThese days, Mrs. Lewis spends time with her grandchildren in her lovely home on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, which is filled with glorious art, including Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and a Picasso, and brags about her two daughters, both of whom also went to Harvard. The oldest, Leslie Lewis, is an actor who created a stage play called \u201cA Miracle in Rwanda\u201d about a woman saved from the massacre in Rwanda; her youngest, Christina Lewis Halpern, created a nonprofit, All Star Code, that trains black and brown boys to code during the summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo in their own way, they\u2019re continuing Mr. Lewis\u2019 legacy,\u201d says Mrs. Lewis, who notes that Mr. Lewis was also a great philanthropist.\n\n\n\nThe Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, founded the same year he made the TLC Beatrice deal, gave an unsolicited $1 million to Howard University. In 1992, Reginald donated $3 million to Harvard Law School\u2014the largest grant in the history of the school at the time. In gratitude, the school renamed its International Law Center the Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center.\n\nFor Moriba, Lewis\u2019 legacy was making what seemed impossible into reality.\n\n\u201cI think his legacy is that he opened doors and he created hope where it didn\u2019t necessarily exist,\u201d Moriba says. \u201cHe became a model of how to be successful and made it real. That\u2019s his legacy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film will air on the New York City tristate region\u2019s local PBS stations and premieres Friday, Feb. 16, at 8 p.m. on WLIW 21; Sunday, Feb. 18, at 7:30 p.m. on WNET 13; and Saturday, Feb. 24, at 7 p.m. on NJTV.

I\u2019ve watched one-and-a-half entire seasons of the OWN religious drama, and I thought I could pick her out of a lineup, but there is something to be said for makeup and disappearing into a role, which ol\u2019 Grace Greenleaf did in this beautiful, Little Mermaid-inspired musical.\n\nOpening night was pretty fascinating. And I have legendary New York society columnist Audrey Bernard to thank for the experience as I was her guest. Celebrities like Orange Is the New Black\u2019s Laverne Cox and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s Tituss Burgess were there looking taut and fierce. Everyone was dressed to impress. Hair done. Nails done. Everything did.\n\nThe actors were on 11 because they were giving it their all. The audience was pumped. And the musical was so refreshing and sweet, it was easy to get caught up in the joy it wrought. (The after-party at New York\u2019s Copacabana wasn\u2019t too shabby, either.)\n\nOnce on This Island was probably my favorite event of the last two weeks I\u2019d gone to, matched only by a very interesting dinner I had at the home of Loida N. Lewis\u2014widow of legendary businessman Reginald F. Lewis\u2014who commemorated her late husband\u2019s almost-billion-dollar business deal to purchase TLC Beatrice back in 1987\u201430 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis was the richest African American in the U.S. in the 1980s and was the first African American to have a billion-dollar business.\n\nBut more on that later on Antisocial, my column about going to events as an occasional social anxiety sufferer in order to get over said social anxiety! Sorry that it\u2019s been a minute. I\u2019ve still been going to all the things and meeting random folks while not passing out from said meetings, but was a wee bit busy \u2014then exhausted\u2014from both our The Root 100 gala in November and working through the entire Thanksgiving holiday, then launching our new beauty vertical, The Glow Up, with supermodel Veronica Webb.\n\nNo shocker here: I\u2019ve been too tired to blog. But I\u2019m back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root 100 Gala\n\nFor me, The Root 100 was like giving birth to triplets at a wedding that\u2019s being televised. Everyone\u2019s asking you questions. Everyone wants to talk to you when all you want to do is pass out, preferably in a dark room with a door that locks. I had plans to be chatty and happy, but alas, my brain wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen because it\u2019s a complete and total asshole.\n\nSome people when they\u2019re really tired or hungry are just mean or crabby; I suffer mass system failure where I can\u2019t really read or form sentences. Our co-hosts, Angela Rye and A.J. Calloway, as well as our founding publisher, Donna Byrd, can attest that my facial expression for the bulk of the evening before I had to get up and speak was \u201cshook.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I was. So shook. Very shook. Shooketh to the core.\n\nI was so stressed that day, I forgot to eat and was extremely nervous about the evening going poorly. But nothing even remotely terrible came to pass; in fact, the whole thing went wonderfully, thanks to our TV team at Fusion and our in-house team at Gizmodo Media Group. GMG\u2019s Victor Jeffreys (the dude who does everything) and Taryn Schweitzer (the woman who also does everything, too, but backward and in heels) made sure I didn\u2019t just sit there and pass out, which was much appreciated. I couldn\u2019t ask for better, more caring co-workers than those who bring you tequila and talk you off a ledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more (and see more) about The Root 100 here.\n\nHigher Heights: Black Women Lead\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter surviving our own very epic, very crazy, very special gala on Nov. 9, I went to Higher Heights\u2019 Black Women Lead event at the Rainbow Room in New York City\u2019s Rockefeller Center on Nov. 13. I was there as a guest of political strategist L. Joy Williams and producer and author Crystal McCrary. There, I ran into BET\u2019s \u00fcber-booked \u2019n\u2019 busy late-night host Robin Thede and Page Six TV\u2019s Bevy Smith and met Netflix\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It co-executive producer (and wife of Spike Lee) Tonya Lewis Lee.\n\nAt this event, for once, I was very comfortable. Perhaps it was because it was nearly all black women. (I do feel safer when we\u2019re in numbers. Like at that mecca of black womanhood, Essence magazine\u2019s annual music festival in New Orleans.) Perhaps it was because I knew a significant number of people in the room\u2014several who were at The Root 100 a few days prior. Or maybe it was because my brain for once was being nice and letting me just chill and enjoy things. I\u2019m not sure. I only remember being moved by Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams\u2019 speech and agreeing with Higher Heights\u2019 overall mission of electing more black women to public service.\n\nAs a black woman who leads (and as someone who took the place of another great black woman who knew how to run things), more black women in charge sounds amazing. More black women in the statehouses. More black women on judicial benches. More black women on the city councils and in Congress. Let\u2019s do this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Deadspin Awards\n\nBecause our events team at GMG is a glutton for punishment, right after they did The Root 100, they had to put on the Deadspin Awards, a drunken bacchanal of sports-based debauchery and athlete-related jokes. I\u2019m pretty sure the sponsor was Kraken rum because I drank at least six rum and Cokes as I tried to survive my own feelings of death and despair from a venue that was full of so many people hooting and hollering about \u201cthe sports,\u201d a thing of which is a source of terror and shame.\n\nYou see? \u201cThe sports\u201d were the reason that while I may have had a father who was home every night and paid all the bills and whatnot, he did not come home every night from a long day at the math-management mines of McDonnell Douglas to play with his precocious children. No. He came home to watch one-and-a-half hours of news followed by four to five hours of \u201cthe sports.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI purposely learned how to like \u201cthe sports\u201d when I was a teen just so I could have a normal conversation with him, since my father loves to talk about \u201cthe sports.\u201d I only know who Terry Bradshaw is because of my father. I only know that the Showtime Lakers were great because of my father. I can read a baseball box score (sort of) because of my father and my pathetic desire to get him to pay attention to me, his middle daughter, back when I was awkward and tiny.\n\nSo \u201cthe sports\u201d and I have a few hangups. Going to the Deadspin Awards was like confronting all my \u201cAm I good enough?\u201d sports-related anxieties over my dad. While my father and I get along famously now and love each other very much, he will still cut a call with me short to talk to his longtime buddy about \u201cthe sports,\u201d because ... priorities. Who does my father love more? Me or several hours of NASCAR? Don\u2019t ask him because I don\u2019t want to know the truth.\n\nThe Deadspin Awards were fun, though, and very hilarious. I even got interviewed by Jezebel\u2019s culture editor, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, for what I assume was a Facebook Live where she asked me my garbage sports opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she asked me what my favorite sport was, I said, \u201cNone of them,\u201d which was honest! Then I lied and said \u201ctennis,\u201d a sport I do enjoy watching if (and only if) an actual Williams sister is involved. Outside of that, tennis can kiss my entire ass.\n\nI wish I\u2019d said that last part out loud, but alas, I was still stone-cold sober when Julianne interviewed me. Lying about liking tennis was about the best I could do in a pinch.\n\n30th Anniversary of Reginald F. Lewis\u2019 Billion-Dollar Deal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no money like a lot of money.\n\n\n\nAs someone who spent a significant portion of her writing career eating Top Ramen and $1 burgers from Sonic so I could afford my rent in Bakersfield, Calif., of all places, I\u2019ve come to appreciate what my father spent most of my adult life trying to impart upon me.\n\n\u201cBaby, you just need to make more money.\u201d\n\n\n\n(The \u201cStop borrowing money from me\u201d part was implied.)\n\nNow that I\u2019m not a starving writer but a thriving editor, I get to contemplate things I\u2019ve never contemplated before. Like, should I buy property? You ... don\u2019t raid your 401(k) for emergency cash over and over until it\u2019s worthless? What\u2019s a stock and a bond? Savings? I ... I have a savings?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure if business tycoon Reginald F. Lewis were still with us and heard anything about my bank statements, he would laugh his ass off, being that he was worth more than $400 million at the time of his untimely death at 50 from brain cancer. He, at that point in his life, had acquired and amassed a $1 billion business\u2014the first African American to do so\u2014and had homes in New York and Paris.\n\nThese are goals I probably won\u2019t meet. But maybe by learning more about Lewis and his business acumen, I can learn how not to go into massive debt living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. Or I could listen to my dad. Both probably have good advice!\n\nIn order for more people to learn the lessons of Lewis, his wife, Loida N. Lewis, held a dinner at her lovely Upper East Side home in New York City on the 30th anniversary of Lewis\u2019 $985 million deal for TLC Beatrice on Nov. 30.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the dinner, I met Good Morning America\u2019s own, former pro-football player Michael Strahan, who was given the Young Entrepreneur Salute for his own strides in the world of business. Strahan, who jokingly said that he had a million jobs, is clearly someone who ascribes to the belief that if you have more than one revenue stream, you\u2019ll never go broke. With clothing lines, TV production, the GMA gig, acting roles, among many others, he\u2019s someone clearly worthy of recognition just based on the hustle alone. He\u2019s also extremely kind and gracious, charming and friendly, as we bonded over dinner over the fact that both our fathers are graduates of the historically black university Prairie View A&M in Texas.\n\nMost of the guests at the dinner were in the press, including TV journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien; TV personality Bevy Smith; Len Burnett, co-founder and publisher of Uptown magazine; MediaTakeOut\u2019s Fred Mwangaguhunga; iOne Digital President Detavio Samuels; Michael Clarke, vice president of digital advertising sales for Entertainment Studios and The Grio; TV personality, producer and blogger Patrick L. Riley; and several others, including members of the Lewis family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had a great time chatting up Loida and Reginald Lewis\u2019 daughter, the founder and director of All Star Code, Christina Lewis Halpern, and her husband, Daniel Halpern\u2014so great that we lost track of time talking about the pending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry of Wales (something I wrote about for the Washington Post last week).\n\nAs I was very gently coaxed out the door by Christina\u2019s mother while she and I exchanged information and pleasantries, I was proud of myself because unlike nearly every event I went to in October and November, I managed not to have an anxiety attack or die. In fact, I simply had a very good time chatting and eating and trying caviar that wasn\u2019t on a sushi roll for the first time. I\u2019d forgotten all about the two hours\u2019 worth of heart palpitations I had had over whether I would have a meltdown (nothing like worrying about impending doom before it\u2019s had a chance to happen). Once I got there, everyone was so warm and funny and friendly\u2014and gossiping about the latest Matt Lauer news\u2014that I forgot to be the self-conscious nerd I typically am. I was happy and chatty and felt really good. Maybe I\u2019m getting better? Is all this going out working? Am I turning into a normal person who can enjoy things?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly time will tell.", "keywords": ["reginald", "jitters", "father", "tv", "100", "black", "consider", "women", "opening", "ive", "im", "deal", "good", "night", "root", "lewis", "gives", "f", "islands"], "polarity": 0.19228871281623577, "subjectivity": 0.5118507651879207},

Gucci demanded that the retailer immediately stop selling any garments or accessories that bore Gucci\u2019s federally trademarked green-red-and-green or blue-red-and-blue striping patterns. Gucci has had trademark registrations on those striping patterns going back as far as 1988.\n\nForever 21 responded in June 2017 by filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, arguing:\n\nMany clothing and accessory items adorned with decorative stripes colored blue-red-blue or green-red-green are sold by countless third parties. ... The colors red, blue, and green, and stripe designs, are among the most favorite, popular and widely used colors and design features on clothing.\n\nThe company contended:\n\nGucci should not be allowed to claim that Gucci, alone, has a monopoly on all blue-red-blue and green-red-green striped clothing and accessory items\u201d and stated \u201cConsumers are not likely to be confused into believing the Striped Products sold in Forever 21\u2019s stores by Forever 21 are manufactured by, sponsored by, authorized by, or otherwise associated or affiliated with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForever 21 asked the court to cancel the at least nine different trademark registrations Gucci has over the patterns, terminate any pending applications for trademarks on the patterns and quash any potential trademark-infringement claims Gucci has against Forever 21.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Fernando M. Olguin sided with Forever 21, stating, \u201cForever 21\u2019s trademark cancellation non-infringement claims are viable\u201d and should be decided at trial.\n\nThe judge also rejected Gucci\u2019s request to dismiss Forever 21\u2019s trademark-cancellation claim, arguing that when consumers see those striping patterns, they do not automatically associate then with Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaura Chapman, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin who is representing Forever 21 in the case, said in a statement to TFL Tuesday, \u201cForever 21 feels very strongly that Gucci improperly sought trademark registrations for these popular designs in a wrongful effort to monopolize them, and that these designs should be freely available for use by anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added that the case highlights more than 100 examples of other brands using that type of striping pattern, including Louis Vuitton, Versace, Valentino, St. John, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Gap and J. Crew, among many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cForever 21 believes Gucci\u2019s trademark registrations and applications should be cancelled by the court and looks forward to continuing to litigate this case to a fair and just result,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nA spokesman for Gucci said, \u201cIn an effort to distract from its own blatant infringements, Forever 21 is attempting to attack some of Gucci\u2019s most famous and iconic trademarks. This will not deter Gucci from pursuing its own claims against Forever 21 as part of its ongoing commitment to the vigorous protection of its valuable intellectual property rights and distinctive brand identity.\u201d\n\nGucci is an iconic brand with many years in the game, and putting aside what the judge in the case has said, I think we can all agree that Gucci\u2019s striping pattern is recognizable as being theirs and have been for many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I would agree that someone going into Forever 21 knows good and damn well that they aren\u2019t buying anything Gucci in a store with prices that low, and there would be no confusion about whether or not Gucci made the garments and accessories.\n\nThere is, however, something to be said for brand recognition. Even customers shopping in Forever 21 would agree that those stripes look like Gucci\u2019s; they just also know they aren\u2019t buying Gucci in Forever 21.", "keywords": ["forever", "red", "green", "21", "trademark", "stripes", "designs", "guccis", "registrations", "case", "patterns", "gucci", "striping"], "polarity": 0.20939393939393935, "subjectivity": 0.5103030303030303},

You don\u2019t care about King\u2019s service to this country, especially considering that the previous president, who has been a disciple of King\u2019s legacy, has served as Donald Trump\u2019s template for what not to do. Donald has spent his first year in office undoing Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, while casually emboldening white supremacy and white nationalism.\n\n\n\nMelania married the man, so she gets no slack.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep.

She even mentioned cyberbullying, which was a bit ironic, since her husband is often seen as one of the biggest cyberbullies of all time.\n\nThe full remarks of Trump\u2019s speech were transcribed by a writer from the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Show me your civic lessons of today and I will show you your civic leaders of tomorrow. Show me your history lessons of today and I will show you your political leaders of tomorrow.

Our choices on how we raise and educate our children will in fact provide the blueprint for the next generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat lessons does she think her husband is teaching not only their young son but an entire nation of young people who see their president on social media and on television saying the first thing that pops into his head without any type of filter? How do the comments he made in his U.N. speech align with what she thinks the children of the world learn from the adults around them? Does she see any irony in this at all?\n\nShe continued:\n\nWe must remember that they are watching and listening so we must never miss an opportunity to teach life\u2019s many ethical lessons along the way. As adults we are not merely responsible. We are accountable. I hope you will join me in committing ourselves to teaching the next generation to live by and honor the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is my paramount in today\u2019s society and my focus as first lady.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sounds like a speech Melania Trump should have been giving to her husband at the dinner table, not to foreign dignitaries at the U.N. who have likely not shown their asses even a fraction as much as Donald Trump has. Is he responsible? Is he accountable? Is he living by and honoring the Golden Rule?\n\n\u201cIt remains our generation\u2019s moral imperative to take responsibility for what our children learn.

Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States?

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president.

I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer.

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States? Nope.

Like, even if Slovenia\u2019s new favorite daughter chose to pose nude back in her modeling days, it was wrong for the New York Post to publish those photos as it sought to exploit her sexuality and demean her. Similarly, as I wrote last fall, Melania has long seemed uncomfortable with the spotlight that came with being a candidate\u2019s spouse, since she only signed up to be a rich man\u2019s wife and hawk some jewelry.\n\n\n\nHowever, while those two truths may exist, there is another that takes precedence: She married a bigoted megalomaniac, a vile monster with only minuscule traces of characteristics associated with humanity who had discussed a potential presidential run as far back as wife No. 1. Perhaps, like most of us, she assumed that her narcissistic nitwit of a husband was merely bullshitting, but there was always the risk that he would actually go through with a real foray into presidential politics.\n\nSo when it comes to the question of whether or not she deserves pity, ask yourself another question first: Why bother?\n\nOver the weekend, Melania looked noticeably uncomfortable at every event associated with her husband\u2019s inauguration. The visible discomfort was so obvious that some outlets reached out to body experts to further explain what may have been going on in Melania\u2019s mind. On the pair\u2019s awkward, rhythm-challenged inaugural dance, body-language expert and professional speaker Patti Wood noted to Mic that Melania leaned away from her husband, Parmesan Putin.\n\n\u201cThat typically says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to merge with you as a partner,\u2019\u201d Wood explained, adding that Tangerine was \u201cpulling her in sexually.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the leader of the Aryan version of Love & Hip Hop: New York\u2019s Creep Squad behaved exactly the way you\u2019d expect\u2014to Melania\u2019s apparent horror. That, coupled with a GIF of a visibly bothered Melania, has sparked cries of \u201cFree Melania.\u201d No matter how well intentioned these efforts, there are ample reasons to scream up \u201cHell nah\u201d in response.\n\nEven when feeling somewhat bad for her, I always kept in the back pocket of my mind that she willfully chose to marry a racist, sexist jackass dedicated to the hobby of being disrespectful. As we move forward with this shit show of an administration, it\u2019s time for all of us to keep such a tidbit front and center. We should also recall that when it comes to bigotry, Melania was an active participant in the very racist conspiracy theory that fueled her husband\u2019s political rise.\n\nNearly six years ago, Melania appeared on Joy Behar\u2019s HLN show and used her status as an immigrant to lend credence to the idea that President Barack Obama needed to show his papers to prove he\u2019s a U.S. citizen. As fate would have it, last year it was reported that Melania worked as a model without a proper visa. The Trump campaign promised a press conference featuring Melania to address the matter, but as with Parmesan Putin\u2019s tax returns, we never saw it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on that very appearance on Behar\u2019s show, Melania touted many of the talking points (he\u2019s a brilliant businessman, negotiator and straight shooter) that would guide her husband\u2019s presidential campaign. One imagines that she might have told him in private, \u201cI was just playing, you orange bitch; don\u2019t do this to me!\u201d but it\u2019s still all her fault for leaving traces of her lipstick on his nonsense.\n\nIf her facial expressions are any indication, the next four years (or however long he lasts) will be painful. Still, there\u2019s only so much sympathy one can have for a wealthy white woman who had no problem going on national television to help her boneheaded, racist husband achieve his goal of delegitimizing the first black president of the United States to cement himself as a political force. Let\u2019s just say that if \u201cso much sympathy\u201d could be converted into currency, it would amount to a single peso.\n\nY\u2019all want to free Melania?

When the press and public demand that the president address issues that he clearly doesn\u2019t care about, it only makes the problem worse\u2014like a teacher squeezing an insincere apology out of a bully who\u2019s just going to hit you again the moment she leaves the room.\n\nTrump spoke Thursday about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["president", "pretend", "trump", "shooting", "school", "speech", "mental", "took", "thats", "health", "republicans", "cares", "dont", "shootings", "listened"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

The photograph went viral, often accompanied on social media with the expression, \u201cI feel sorry for Melania Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was just one of many pieces of evidence that Melania Trump deserves sympathy; that she is unhappy, that her husband treats her poorly or, more hopefully, that she hates her husband. In addition to the photograph, other evidence was offered: a video of the couple dancing at the inaugural ball and a side-by-side comparison of former President Obama accompanying Michelle during the 2009 White House transition. Obama is thoughtful, he waits for Michelle before he walks up the steps of their new home to greet then-President George W. Bush. In contrast, Donald Trump greets the Obamas without his wife and she hurries to make her way up the stairs alone, accompanied into the house by the Obamas who are more considerate\u2014more respectful\u2014than her own husband.\n\nThe images, particularly the comparison to President Obama, reinforce a narrative that is easy enough to believe (likely because it\u2019s true): that Obama is a better man than Trump and thus treats women accordingly. The Obamas, in turn, express their sympathy for Melania, a poor woman married to a tyrant, by showing their graciousness, a hallmark of the Obama White House, actions that speak volumes about their humanity and morality. Here, Melania is a victim of her husband\u2019s brutishness; she is passive and silent, has no political opinions but instead is a sort of tabula rasa for America\u2019s women, on which her treatment is proof of President Trump\u2019s innate misogyny. President Trump\u2019s casual misuse of his wife is a domestic tragedy with national implications. But that narrative only works if, in fact, you believe that Melania is a blank slate or, at least, a woman simply acted on rather than a woman actively collaborating with her husband\u2019s ideologies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the past is any indication, Melania is no passive victim. Recently a 2011 interview with Melania on the Joy Behar Show went viral on Twitter. In the interview, Melania defends her husband\u2019s adamant commitment to the birther conspiracy born of the Tea Party\u2014his belief that President Obama is not an American citizen, that he was born in Kenya and that his Hawaii-issued birth certificate was, in fact, a forgery. \u201cDo you want to see President Obama\u2019s birth certificate or not?\u201d Melania asks Behar. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Behar responds. \u201cIt\u2019s not a birth certificate,\u201d Melania says as she shakes her head. Here, Melania recites her husband\u2019s conspiratorial and fictitious claims, ones Donald Trump repeated for five years until, in September 2016, he \u201cconceded\u201d that they were untrue. Melania has never indicated whether or not she agrees with that concession.\n\n\n\nBut Melania has always been willing to defend her husband and to employ tactics that typify the Trump approach to the world. After journalist Julia Ioffe published a profile of Melania in GQ, Melania denounced the piece, calling it \u201cyet another example of the dishonest media and their disingenuous reporting.\u201d When Ioffe received a barrage of anti-Semitic messages and threats, Melania said, that Ioffe \u201cprovoked them.\u201d Later, Melania almost trollishly announced that, as First Lady, she would launch a campaign to prevent bullying on the internet, denouncing social media\u2019s \u201cmean and rough\u201d culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media aside, she\u2019s proven that she\u2019s a willing scribe of the Trump hagiography. In October, Melania sat down with CNN to defend her husband after a leaked tape caught her husband bragging about sexually assaulting women. She called his language \u201cboy talk\u201d and blamed the tape\u2019s release on the conspiratorial \u201cleft-wing media.\u201d When asked about the sizable number of women who have accused her husband of sexual assault, she demonstrated that she was no listless vessel, but in full possession of autonomy: \u201cI know he respects women but he is defending himself because they are all lies,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nLike Ivanka Trump, whose brand and subsequent media narratives have worked to distance her from her father\u2019s repugnant ideologies from racist birtherism to sexual assault, Melania is no innocent. She\u2019s willing to vocally defend her husband\u2014not only to stand next to him for the sake of political spectacle or personal gain, but to do the obligatory media tours and, like her step-daughter, insist that he respects women.\n\nMelania Trump is hardly a stand-in for American women, she is neither a victim nor is she lacking agency. Rather she\u2019s an active participant working to construct Donald Trump\u2019s narrative, readily available to put a gauzy domestic veil on his racism and misogyny.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

Ultimately she was fired from the show but never lost her cunning, conniving and treacherously deceitful ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was these character traits that made her endearing to the orange-tinged KFC-grease stain in office.

To help you get through this process, we present to you \u201cThe 6 Stages of Grief Over the Obamas Leaving the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\n1. Shock and Denial\n\nWhat? Barack and Michelle only have a month left in office? No! I still haven\u2019t bought them a housewarming gift. I went to the White House and didn\u2019t see a picture of Jesus having dinner with Martin, Malcolm, Tupac, Biggie and Harriet Tubman, so I was going to get a print for them to hang in the Lincoln Bedroom. Where did the time go? It seems like only yesterday, Republicans and conservatives were screaming, \u201cNot my president\u201d and vowing to obstruct the new commander in chief at every turn, and a scant eight years later, they\u2019re calling it unpatriotic and hateful! Man, time really flies when you\u2019re stabilizing the global economy, rebounding from the worst recession since the Great Depression, providing affordable health care to the entire country and killing the most wanted man on the planet!\n\nAnd what the hell are we supposed to do without Michelle? We\u2019re supposed to just go all willy-nilly from an Ivy League-educated barrister to an Eastern European plagiarist whose facial expression always looks like she\u2019s struggling to solve the Soul Train scramble board? That\u2019s not fair to the American people. As a matter of fact, I think your math might be off a little bit. I swear it can\u2019t be eight years already. Are you sure you counted all the days? Leap years, too? I don\u2019t believe you. I\u2019m gonna double-check.\n\n\n\n2. Pain and Guilt\n\nYeah, you were right. It has been a whole eight years. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. Barack and Michelle are really leaving. The White House chef is packing up the Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt and everything! This hurts too much. The uncertainty is giving me the bubble guts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel like this is all my fault. I think we all took the Obamas for granted. Maybe we just assumed our next president would know that \u201cbigly\u201d wasn\u2019t a word and that \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d is a couple of Greeks, but not a book of the Bible. Do you think Melania knows how to Dougie? You think Trump knows any Al Green songs or has any idea what \u201cHotline Bling\u201d is? (Although I\u2019m willing to bet there was at least one blond-haired white boy on his boarding school rowing team named \u201cDrake.\u201d) We didn\u2019t appreciate them when we had them, and now that Michelle and Barack are almost gone, what are we to do?\n\n\n\n3. Anger\n\nNo, I\u2019m not mad.\n\nOK, maybe I\u2019m a little upset.\n\nYou know what, America? You\u2019re damn right I\u2019m mad! Most of all, I\u2019m disappointed in all the white people. Now that you are faced with the prospect of returning to the era of dim-witted white men leading our country, you want to ask for a mulligan and change the Electoral College. Now, that\u2019s white privilege! Maybe you didn\u2019t know this, but ain\u2019t no do-overs in the Constitution, bih! You screwed up royally! It was just eight years ago when we had a leader who achieved all of his success because of his daddy, and an evil, white-haired vice president running everything behind the scenes! You wanna go back to that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I have to blame some of this on Barack Obama, too! He\u2019s been president for eight years. He saw the political and economic morass he inherited and he knew these other pea-brained, privileged politicians had neither the intellectual heft nor the perseverance to lead this nation. He knows how fragile white people are. Donald Trump probably hasn\u2019t sat on a toilet that wasn\u2019t gold-plated since he was a toddler (when he had a platinum training potty), and Hillary Clinton fainted after spending an entire day sitting down. Sitting down! Do you know how many times President Obama probably had pneumonia these past eight years?\n\nNone. Because he had s\u2014t to do.\n\nYet during these last eight years, Obama didn\u2019t see fit to gather some of the best quantum physicists, theoretical engineers and molecular scientists to create a time machine that would allow him to go back to the past and clone himself. The fact that our next president and first lady aren\u2019t named Darack and Rochelle Obama is a travesty, and I\u2019m placing all of the upcoming failures of the Trump administration (of which there will be many) squarely on the shoulders of Barack Obama\u2019s poor, non-time-machine agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I know it isn\u2019t his fault. Maybe I\u2019m a little too emotional right now.\n\n\n\n4. Bargaining\n\nMaybe we can make a deal. Can Barack and Michelle get an extension? If Barack Obama has been subject to every conceivable racist stereotype during the last eight years, why must his term end now? Why can\u2019t his presidency end on C.P. Time? Maybe Barack can just delay the Trump inauguration. I bet we can extend Barack and Michelle\u2019s stay at least a couple of months if they keep sending Donald texts that say, \u201cAlmost there. Pulling up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, I know. Here\u2019s a plan:\n\nBarack and Michelle can go back to the White House, ring the doorbell and, when Melania answers, tell her that they left their hot sauce, their Quran or some other b.s. white people believe black people can\u2019t live without. When they let the Obamas in, Barack just grabs Trump\u2019s phone and tweets, \u201cI quit.\u201d Apparently\u2014according to the lazy, new-millennium mainstream media\u2014Trump\u2019s tweet\u2019s are legally binding statements that rank somewhere between the Declaration of Independence and the red words in the New Testament. I bet it would work, because the fact-checking process in most media sources consists of someone reading over social media, shrugging their shoulders and mouthing the universal declaration of editorial journalistic integrity:\n\n\u201cSeems legit.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Depression\n\nAs the end of the Obama presidency draws closer, each day gets tougher. Every morning I wake up wondering if this is the last day I\u2019ll have health care. Every night I go to sleep knowing this may be my last because Donald Trump may wake up in the middle of the night and tweet something that leads to World War III.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI already miss the Obamas so much. Sasha and Malia feel like a part of my family. Am I going to get to see my little cousins again? In my head, Sasha was always starting something and blaming it on Malia. I bet she tattled on Malia all the time, too. And just like the stronger, older sibling, Malia took it because she loved her little Sasha\u2014even if she could be a little aggravating. See how I created that entire scenario in my head from nothing but press photos and imagination?\n\nThat\u2019s because for eight years, the Obamas allowed black people to dream. It wasn\u2019t just about what Barack and Michelle accomplished that made them great. It was about what they represented. For every year of America\u2019s existence, until a few years ago, the idea of a black president was\u2014at most\u2014a good, but too-outrageous-to-consider premise. It was for comedy sketches and science fiction movies. Then came the Obamas. An unblemished black man with a charming and successful black wife and a beautiful black family. They were an unbelievable possibility that actually came true and made us think anything was achievable.\n\nAnd now they\u2019re leaving.\n\n\n\n6. Acceptance\n\nIn a few weeks, the Obama portion of American history will come to an end. We think we are prepared. We are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Barack Obama will go down as the first black president. Even though the country seems intent on regression, maybe America will progress. Maybe the wall of presidential portraits will one day be more diverse than 42 white men and that one black dude. Or maybe this is a moment in time we were fortunate to have witnessed.\n\nI can imagine, years from now, when I am sitting on the passenger side of my great-great-grandson\u2019s anti-matter hovercraft, that he will turn down the satellite in-dash hologram machine giving us news about another police light-sabering of an unarmed black man, and ask me about the days of yore when we had a black president, and I will tell him about the two thousand, nine hundred and twenty days when a black man was the leader of the free world. How proud we were. How safe we were. How we prospered.\n\nUntil that day comes, I will hold on to these last few moments and remember the past seven years, 10 months, one week and two days (not that I\u2019m counting). I will not be rattled by the prospect of what is to come. I will not allow these last remnants of this time to be tarnished by hate or fear. When it is over, I will be glad I experienced it, and think back on it with a smile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019m gon\u2019 cry in the car.", "keywords": ["white", "barack", "president", "grief", "days", "stages", "im", "obama", "black", "maybe", "obamas", "michelle", "think"], "polarity": 0.031644630041011625, "subjectivity": 0.3816309239006607},

News broke Tuesday that Mueller seems to really be digging into the idea that the president attempted to obstruct the investigation on multiple occasions, but that doesn\u2019t bother Big Donnie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he is reported to have said.\n\nMe too, Big Donnie.\n\nI think it should be broadcast around the world so that we can all be watching at the moment his addled-brain ass goes completely off script and starts volunteering information that Mueller didn\u2019t even ask for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know how he likes to brag about himself. Please, let him tell us how he outsmarted everyone by firing Michael Flynn, firing James Comey and punking Jeff Sessions into a stunned silence.\n\nWe want to know.\n\nListen. You wouldn\u2019t even have to charge a lot of money to make big money off this event because everyone would want to watch. This would probably be the one and only pay-per-view event that everyone would watch legally instead of through bootleg methods because the price would be worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you listening to me, Cox Communications?

As the Washington Post reports, the 32-year-old carpenter grew concerned about the safety of his 3-year-old twins and 1-year old son. The Post notes that the early-morning sighting capped \u201ca string of attempted intrusions\u201d into his home in recent weeks.\n\nSo Rodriguez did what many might do when confronted with a stranger on their property: He called the cops.\n\nThe officers did find the trespasser but didn\u2019t arrest him because they had no probable cause, police say. They did end up arresting Rodriguez. As CNN reports, after asking for his ID, cops discovered that he had an outstanding warrant they believed to be criminal. Not long after calling the police to investigate a possible intruder, Rodriguez, who is an undocumented immigrant, found himself in the back of a squad car.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next, according to the Post:\n\nRodriguez overheard an officer discussing by speakerphone with a voice on the other end of the line. It was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cortes said. \u201cDo you want us to bring him to you?\u201d the officer asked, Rodriguez later recalled. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d the voice responded. Minutes later, the officers left Rodriguez at a nearby ICE field office. Rodriguez was shackled and later taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, one of the largest detention facilities in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, the warrant wasn\u2019t criminal at all. According to the Tukwila Police Department\u2019s own admissions, it misinterpreted the nature of the warrant against Rodriguez. It was actually an administrative warrant, related to a missed court hearing from 2004, when authorities in Texas discovered that he had entered the country illegally.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Luis Cortes Romero, told the Post that his client never received the notice to attend the mandatory court meeting, but missing it triggered a removal order.\n\nThis makes Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, essentially, a mistake. The Tukwila PD confirmed that it \u201cdoes not respond to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals on their behalf.\u201d The only reason Rodriguez was arrested was that his administrative warrant appeared like a criminal one in the National Criminal Information Center database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement now refuses to release Rodriguez, according to his lawyer. He maintains that his client has no criminal record. Rodriguez could be deported within a matter of days, leaving his young children without a father.\n\n\n\nThe arrest falls in line with one of the more troubling trends of the Donald Trump administration. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed in the last year. The Washington Post found that ICE had detained 37,734 undocumented \u201cnoncriminal\u201d immigrants in 2017. This was twice the number arrested in Barack Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious concerns, of upending the lives of thousands of people and disrupting families and communities, the immigrant crackdown has also triggered a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on crime reporting across the country. Undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crimes like robbery and sexual assault have refused to report them for fear of being handed over to ICE, according to police and immigration advocates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Police Department, which says it has \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to develop and maintain relations with its large immigrant and refugee population, says that it will not be responding to administrative warrants from ICE going forward.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer has requested a stay of removal for the carpenter on humanitarian grounds, the Post reports.

To serve one\u2019s God is a mighty purpose. It requires selflessness and compassion.\n\n\n\nSo it is with all due respect that I ask, what the fuck happened to Mark Burns? I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling. To date, Burns has some 87,300 followers on Twitter and an additional 4,500 on Instagram. Not to mention, he pastors a church, which means he\u2019s preaching his love of Trump and all things Trumpian to rooms full of black people. And. They. Are. Listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to two points: 1) We cannot dismiss Burns, and 2) What the fuck happened to him? Like, what level of self-hatred must you endure to fall this far? He\u2019s 38 years old, which means that someone in his life had to love him enough to induce him to the revolutionary sounds of N.W.A. Where was he during the No Limit movement? Has he ever been \u201cBout It, Bout It\u201d?\n\nDid he not watch the Diff\u2019rent Strokes episode where Dudley was almost molested by the bicycle-store owner, but for a quick-thinking Arnold? That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K. Brown, to tweet this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat happened. And this man is ministering to other black people. He\u2019s widening his platform daily and is one of the few public black faces that are helping to grease the asses of other black folks so that Trump\u2019s foot can fit. I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers. The Trump Organization is exactly the kind of company that relies on the H-2B visa program for low-skilled workers. Vox reviewed recruiting files submitted to the US Department of Labor for two Trump properties in Florida (including Mar-a-Lago) and one in New York from the start of 2016 through the end of 2017.

By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

The way it would work is that those on government assistance would receive less money on their EBT cards, and in return they\u2019d be sent a box of items including \u201cshelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit and vegetables.\u201d The boxes would not include fresh fruits or vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, recipients would receive canned meat.

According to a scathing bit of news from Vanity Fair, not only is Kelly\u2019s time coming to an end, but Ivanka is already looking for his replacement.\n\nHere\u2019s how Vanity Fair breaks it down:\n\nTwo prominent Republicans in frequent contact with the White House told me that Trump has discussed choosing Kelly\u2019s successor in recent days, asking a close friend what he thought about David Urban, a veteran Washington lobbyist and political operative who helped engineer Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania. Ivanka is also playing a central role in the search, quietly field-testing ideas with people. \u201cIvanka is the most worried about it. She\u2019s trying to figure who replaces Kelly,\u201d a person who\u2019s spoken with her said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the magazine, the only reason Kelly hasn\u2019t been tossed out of the White House like Uncle Phil used to do Jazzy Jeff is that Trump knows that firing another senior staff member would do nothing but bring more trouble to his wobbly tenure.\n\nSources told Vanity Fair that Kelly doesn\u2019t want to be in the White House anymore and is only holding on to stay longer than Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff.\n\nThe seam started to split between Kelly and Trump after Kelly did an interview noting that the president\u2019s position had evolved since campaigning for office. The president was reportedly furious that Kelly would leak that truth on national television, since anyone with working ears and a decent set of eyes knows that his positions have moved more than an air hockey puck. Shortly after Kelly\u2019s interview, Trump took to Twitter, as he\u2019s been known to do, tweeting: \u201cThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who didn\u2019t see all of this coming? In fact, many people were surprised that Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was highly respected, would agree to work with a president who\u2019s been a hot button and arguably on the wrong side of history since running for office.\n\nKelly has been credited with streamlining who has access to the president and was instrumental in kicking hangers-on Omarosa Manigault Newman and Steve Bannon out of the White House. But Trump can\u2019t stand it when someone else is seen as the adult to his petulant-child antics, so of course this was never going to work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more Kelly plays up that he\u2019s being the adult in the room\u2014that it\u2019s basically combat duty and he\u2019s serving the country\u2014that kind of thing drives Trump nuts,\u201d a Republican close to the White House told Vanity Fair.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has fumed to friends that Kelly acts like he\u2019s running the government while Trump tweets and watches television.\n\nAlso, Trump reportedly told one friend: \u201cI\u2019ve got another nut job here who thinks he\u2019s running things,\u201d referring to Kelly, Vanity Fair reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the White House will tell you that this is more fake news and that there\u2019s nothing wrong between Kelly and Trump. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what the White House did.\n\nA White House official told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s categorically false that Trump is unhappy with Kelly. He\u2019s only ever referred to him as the general, tough, can be rough, and commands respect.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t believe anything that comes out of the White House. If they were a pair of pants, they\u2019d be on fire. If they were a journalist, they\u2019d be BuzzFeed Benny. If they were a black woman, they\u2019d be Rachel Dolezal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s just a matter of time until Kelly announces that he\u2019s leaving the White House for a job in the mainstream, where he can better serve the Trump administration\u2014which is starting to be the company line.\n\nRead more at Vanity Fair.", "keywords": ["white", "john", "vanity", "trump", "told", "worn", "theyd", "kelly", "trumps", "report", "fair", "running", "staff", "welcome", "chief", "hes", "house"], "polarity": 0.10879365079365076, "subjectivity": 0.48612698412698396},

Obama\u2019s soaring speech, followed by Springsteen\u2019s song, offered a momentary respite from the grief, dread and shock many Americans experienced after the election of Donald Trump.\n\nAs the night came to a close and Michelle and Barack Obama walked off the stage hand in hand, one era was ending and another was coming into sharper view. Obama\u2019s and Springsteen\u2019s messages blended together to reassure listeners that everything would be all right: \u201cLeave behind your sorrows/Let this day be the last/Tomorrow there\u2019ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.\u201d\n\nOne year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a majority of Americans know that everything is not all right. The darkness that Springsteen sang about has not passed. Instead, it has surrounded and battered us on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Just when we think things can\u2019t get any worse, news breaks of another ill-informed, inappropriate and unpresidential tweet.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s lead role in escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea created mass hysteria in Hawaii when an emergency message was sent in error about a ballistic missile threat. Hawaiians and tourists ran to seek shelter and wrote frantic goodbyes via text message to their loved ones. Pick your nightmare. Anything is possible\u2014even nuclear holocaust\u2014with Trump as president.\n\nWe have serious cause to question whether our democratic principles will endure. Let\u2019s face the facts: The president of the United States is a racist, a xenophobe, a sexual predator, a chauvinist, and a thin-skinned and small-minded man who lacks empathy, morality and competence. He knows too little history to recognize that he is on the wrong side of it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not only naive but it is dangerous to excuse Trump\u2019s words and actions with a wave of the hand and an assertion, as House Speaker Paul Ryan made after \u201ccandid conversations\u201d with Trump, that \u201chis heart is in the right place.\u201d\n\nIt is equally wrongheaded to claim that we could not have known that Trump would disparage women and people of color as viciously as he has. Recall Trump\u2019s comments before the election about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia or his view that Mexico was sending \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to America. Indeed, Trump catapulted himself into the political arena by ruthlessly questioning the citizenship status and the birth certificate of the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s racist deeds did not begin with his run for president or his decision to absolve neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., for their hateful acts this summer. For the last 40 years, Trump has actively engaged in stoking this country\u2019s racist fires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department sued Trump in 1973 for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in some of his housing developments to African Americans. In 1989 Trump spent $85,000 on full-page advertisements in New York City newspapers that called for the death penalty for the African-American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the city\u2019s Central Park.\n\nAmericans knew who they were voting for, and still, they elected Trump.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past two years, Trump has dishonored the day that celebrates the life of Martin Luther King Jr. While former presidents\u2014Republicans and Democrats alike\u2014have honored the wishes of the King family and participated in a day of service, this year, Trump played golf.\n\nLast year, during the weekend of the King holiday, Trump mischaracterized the district of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) as \u201cfalling apart (not to mention crime-infested)\u201d and \u201cin horrible shape.\u201d This was yet another example of Trump\u2019s ignorance: The district, which includes parts of Atlanta and its suburbs, is, in fact, a prosperous hub of tech companies and colleges.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination approaches this April, we must steel ourselves for more unpresidential behavior, as we have no reason to expect anything else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d should come as no surprise to those who are familiar with his long history of racism and who have followed his rise to power. But what makes these comments so disturbing is not whether they prove that Trump is a racist. We already knew that. His comments erode American values.\n\n\n\nA poll released Thursday showed a free fall in other nations\u2019 approval of American leadership, with such approval down 18 points to a historical low of 30 percent. The United States lags behind Germany and China and ranks just slightly ahead of Russia. Recall that on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly boasted that he would restore the respect that Obama had supposedly lost while in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Springsteen\u2019s song underscores American ideals and uses the image of a train as a powerful metaphor for America as a nation of immigrants. Springsteen calls for a motley group of passengers to board a train and meet him in the \u201cland of hope and dreams.\u201d This train, we are told, carries \u201csaints and sinners,\u201d \u201closers and winners,\u201d \u201cwhores and gamblers,\u201d \u201clost souls,\u201d the \u201cbrokenhearted,\u201d \u201cthieves and sweet souls departed,\u201d and \u201cfools and kings.\u201d These passengers do not need tickets, Springsteen explains; all they have to do is \u201cjust get on board.\u201d\n\nOne could argue that throughout his presidency, Obama told people in the United States and around the world that in America, a singular opportunity existed to take a seat on the train that Springsteen describes. Obama reminded us that \u201cin no other country on earth is [his] story even possible.\u201d The son of a Kenyan immigrant, a black man named Barack Hussein Obama had ascended to the highest office in the United States.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible. America will be a fundamentally different country. We have already seen parents separated from their children and deported after living in the United States for 30 years. The lives of 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d continue to hang in the balance after Trump ended the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we give up on the hard work of maintaining a vibrant and diverse democracy and if we stop striving to become a \u201cmore perfect union,\u201d we will become more isolated and more diminished in the eyes of the world than we are now. We have always fallen short of our ideals, but the current occupant of the White House appears woefully ignorant of what those ideals are.\n\n\n\nTrump sorely needs a history lesson to learn about the untold contributions of immigrants who built this country and risked their lives to defend it. Trump has no curiosity or knowledge about the realities of the lives of Haitian immigrants, who he believes \u201call have AIDS.\u201d Nor does he understand Haiti\u2019s historic achievement of becoming the world\u2019s first black republic in 1804.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe fails to grasp the consequences of military interventions, imperialism and economic exploitation that Haiti has faced. He believes that Nigerians live in \u201chuts\u201d and remains unaware that according to the U.S. census, Nigerian immigrants eclipse both whites and Asians and have the highest levels of education in the country.\n\nIt will be a herculean, if not impossible, task to disabuse Trump of the numerous stereotypes, unsophisticated thoughts and outright incorrect ideas that he holds.\n\nOne wonders if Trump knows that Founding Father and fellow New Yorker Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant born to unmarried parents on the West Indian island of Nevis.

That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E.

He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns.

The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week.

If there were a Pulitzer for \u201cWriting While Aggressively White,\u201d this passage would definitely be a nominee:\n\nImagine a woman named Mary Turner, who lives in Wheeling, West Virginia. She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

Trump obstructed justice to suppress the tape of him splish-splashing naked in a puddle of post-orgy Soviet urine like an albino walrus wallowing in a pool of off-brand apple juice. Authorities will reveal how he rigged the election, stuffed his pocket full of rubles and manipulated the Justice Department to cover it up.\n\n\n\nEven worse ... none of it will matter.\n\nWhen dissecting the authoritarian-esque rise of the lace-front-wearing chief executive, pundits strain to explain why Trump is bulletproof. They point to partisanship, conservatism and the recently discovered phenomenon of working-class white oppression as the reason that 83 percent of white Republicans and 47 percent of all white people still approve of the job he is doing as president.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s legislative failures, unrepentant racism, and unfortunate allergy to facts and truth, The Donald\u2019s devotees will not admit that he has committed a single misstep. He has convinced congressional Republicans, Fox News watchers and people who consider Nick Cannon \u201ctoo urban\u201d that verifiable evidence means nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them, thousands of media outlets have formed a secret cabal to perpetuate fake news. The FBI, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d have all manufactured his decadeslong connection with Russia. Random women have all made up similar lies about his sexual misdeeds. Even science and math have joined the party to misstate his popular vote totals, his poll numbers and how many people showed up to his inauguration. There is only one way to explain why logic and reason no longer apply to the president:\n\nDonald Trump is a God.\n\nTrumpism has evolved from a political ideology into a religion with an unerring tyrannical messiah at the center of it all. He is no longer a politician, he is a religious figure, and admitting it is the first step to understanding the cultlike devotion to Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gospel According to Trump\n\nI do not make this claim without acknowledging the fact that I, too, have made a god out of a mere mortal. Even before I knew or understood what religion or a Bible was, my mother was my first deity, and her words might as well have been written in red in a religious text.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s acolytes toward him, when it came to my mother, I believed that whatever came out of her mouth was the unadulterated truth. In the rare instances that I questioned her, she responded to my queries with the same reasoning offered by the president or a Baptist preacher forced to answer a biblical inconsistency:\n\nBecause she said so.\n\nWhen someone points out that immigrants are less likely to commit a crime, that white men commit more acts of terrorism or that the economy is a product of Obama\u2019s policies, Trump bypasses reason and doubles down on rhetoric. Even though net immigration has been negative for more than 10 years, Trump\u2019s followers believe that kicking out Mexicans and Muslims will magically transform America into a utopian paradise in the same way that some Christians show up on Sundays to pay 10 percent of their income to an already wealthy pastor to buy a seat in the VIP section of the afterlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s fans dismiss anyone who questions as an unholy blasphemer using their carnal mind. Nothing has to make sense. He said it. That\u2019s enough.\n\nThus sayeth Trump.\n\nTrump Is Great and Worthy of Praise\n\nWhen talking about Trump\u2019s disciples, we often imagine poor whites in the South and Appalachia who haven\u2019t had anyone so blond and worthy of reverence since Rick Flair hung up his unitard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even learned men have converted to the cult of Trump, as his Cabinet meetings have become eerily similar to the last supper or the final Kool-Aid brunch in Jonestown, Guyana, replete with seemingly intelligent people showering him with praise. He even opens every meeting with praise and worship devotional service:\n\nHe is no longer campaigning, but like other religious figures, Trump travels around the country holding tent revivals and rallies whipping crowds into Holy Ghost-like frenzies when he preaches. He\u2019s not doing this for votes. He\u2019s just spreading his gospel to the masses, calling NFL players \u201csons of bitches\u201d and explaining how he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City and shoot a man, all to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire Republican Party has joined the church, including the seemingly sane apostle Paul Ryan, who gushed over Trump\u2019s \u201cexquisite leadership.\u201d Ben Carson even thanked his lord and savior for Donald Trump in a recent White House prayer.\n\nLater this year, Trump will go all out and order the U.S. armed forces to honor him with a formal military parade. The Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden criticized the plans for a formally attired military display as \u201cThird World bullshit,\u201d but those of us who have attended a black church know that the choir always marches in on the pastor\u2019s anniversary.\n\nTrump Is a Miracle-Maker\n\n\u201cHe performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.\u201d \u2014Job 5:9\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone examining the cult of Trump cannot ignore his incredible record of accomplishments:\n\n\n\nThere might be some people who fact-check these claims and discover that none of them are true, but those people aren\u2019t true believers. When members of his congregation casually dismiss truth as \u201cfake news,\u201d they are essentially accusing the press of being false prophets trying to smear their savior. Anyone who besmirches his sanctity is a heathen, a liar or\u2014even worse\u2014a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will tell you that he kept America safe from terrorism because they don\u2019t count the Las Vegas killing, the Texas church massacre, the Unite the Right killing, or any of the long list of mass shootings and hate crimes as \u201cterrorist events,\u201d in the same way that God answers prayers when anything good happens, but it\u2019s Satan\u2019s fault when anything bad occurs.\n\nThat\u2019s how the cult of Trump works. It also explains why trying to apply reason to the presidency of Donald Trump is an exercise in futility. Facts are irrelevant. Logic is meaningless.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis followers will never believe he\u2019s racist. Republican voters will continue to reject the claims of the 18 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Fox News won\u2019t even cover any scandal that doesn\u2019t have to do with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Trump is Teflon. He will never be impeached out of office, even if the FBI investigation turns up concrete evidence that shows he colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.\n\nThe fact that he has been deified by white America is not likely to change.

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10.

Now a new report raises questions as to whether there is more to Trump\u2019s history with Daniels than just a one-time encounter.\n\nJacob Weisberg reports on Slate that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told him that she\u2019d had an affair with Trump that began after she met him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. The sexual relationship continued for nearly a year, according to her account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her conversations with Weisberg\u2014which took place between August and October 2016\u2014Daniels said that she could describe things about Trump that only someone who had seen him naked would know, and contrary to what Marla Maples is supposed to have said, Trump was not that great in bed.\n\nTrump allegedly made several unkept promises to Daniels, telling her that he would buy her a condo in Tampa, Fla., and that he would feature her in a season of Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels told Weisberg that she had proof of the affair. She had the phone numbers of Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant Rhonda Graff and his bodyguard Keith Schiller, who helped her arrange rendezvous with Trump.\n\nFrom Slate:\n\nGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t think an extramarital affair would be a highly significant story. What interested me more was Daniels\u2019 allegation that Trump had negotiated to buy her silence. Daniels said that, through intermediaries, she and Trump had worked out an agreement for the presidential candidate to pay her a six-figure sum to keep quiet. More specifically, she said her lawyer Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based attorney who specializes in claims against celebrities, had worked out the terms with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time Daniels spoke with Weisberg, she indicated that she believed Trump was stalling on the agreement to pay her the $130,000.\n\nA week after the 2016 election, she stopped returning calls, and a friend of hers told Weisberg that she had, in fact, taken the money from Trump.\n\nSounds messy, but it also sounds just like Trump. He\u2019s just sloppy all around.\n\nAnd, apparently, bad in bed. Poor Melania.\n\nRead more at Slate.", "keywords": ["trump", "told", "trumps", "donald", "daniels", "silence", "stormy", "weisberg", "worked", "affair", "slate", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.12758136924803593, "subjectivity": 0.4973905723905724},

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed. And they\u2019ll probably be scanning for a teacup to smack out of your hands.", "keywords": ["white", "khalid", "probably", "man", "airports", "tell", "random", "ive", "black", "person", "woman", "telling", "look"], "polarity": -0.01694444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.4044642857142857},

But the news cycle that seems to find Russia under every rock has become too repetitive and overwhelming for me to bear any longer.\n\nWithout question, it\u2019s clear that Moscow tried to exploit Americans\u2019 political views through social media during the 2016 presidential election. Not only have America\u2019s intelligence communities determined as much, but the heads of the social media platforms that Russian-backed entities exploited concur. Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014be it his former national security adviser Mike Flynn or ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2014have ties to Moscow that point to possible collusion.\n\nJulia Ioffe of The Atlantic recently reported that Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks via private messages on Twitter concerning damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Hope Hicks may have tried to hide emails concerning a mysterious meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians tied to the Kremlin. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News that the Russian government breached U.S. voting systems.\n\nThese stories are revealing but are few and far between. When we aren\u2019t hearing groundbreaking news on the Russian investigation, which is not common, we\u2019re inundated with talking heads discussing how shady Trump and his cronies are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYawn. We know already.\n\nMy problem with the news cycle is that it is ignoring white America\u2019s complicity in the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the first place. If Russian bots can undo in one election cycle what it took centuries to build, does America have a democracy at all? And if we are to believe that disinformation campaigns turned the outcome for Trump (there is no evidence of that), why didn\u2019t most voters of color cast ballots for him?\n\nA lack of a self-reflective discourse in mainstream media\u2019s coverage essentially scapegoats Russia for the debacle that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. It\u2019s one thing to cover the Russia investigation. It\u2019s another to ignore or downplay why white people voted for a man who refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, even when America\u2019s top intelligence agencies confirmed Putin\u2019s role in attempting to undermine the U.S. political process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia coverage devoid of this angle ignores the social chasms that compel white people to choose their race over allegiance to their country. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s challenging for me to watch and read news of Russia\u2019s threat to democracy when America is doing a great job of destroying it all by itself.\n\n\n\nMy cynicism is rooted in the knowledge of America\u2019s barbaric resolve to strip black people of their rights to fully experience the democracy that, coincidentally, did not come under attack until Russia unleashed a legion of Twitter trolls.\n\n\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t afford me the luxury of binary analysis. I can\u2019t just look at the Kremlin\u2019s threats against America without recognizing the internal threats that Moscow actively attempted to exploit\u2014threats that have a personal impact on my life as a black person. I don\u2019t enjoy the full spectrum of citizenship; nor does the rest of black America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve endured more than 200 years of slavery, decades of Jim Crow, mob violence and voter suppression. These horrendous periods still haunt America. The Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voter Rights Act in 2013. GOP-led state legislatures actively passed voter-ID laws that make voting harder. America\u2019s police state kills black people at disproportionate rates, and governments at the federal and state levels are actively undermining health care access.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t flow with the \u201cRussia is attacking our democracy\u201d angle because America is doing a better job of it. Of course, we can admit that Russian meddling isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019d be more inclined to engage media that explores Americans\u2019 complicity in it. I know what\u2019s wrong with this country, and it isn\u2019t Russia. It\u2019s racist white Trump supporters. If they had followed the conscience of people of color (especially black women), American democracy wouldn\u2019t be under the threat it\u2019s currently in.\n\nTo see countless white men (former ambassadors, think tank types, legislators and the running chorus of talking heads) appear on network television extolling the virtues of America\u2019s so-called democracy that Russia wants to undermine annoys me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs journalists, it is our job to report the facts. That racism both fueled Trump\u2019s victory and has consequently made us more susceptible to foreign attack only makes the stakes of the Russia investigation even higher. But major networks and print outlets will not lead with stories exploring white America\u2019s obsession with racism. That would upset too many advertisers\u2014and white viewers. But it would be the beginning of the type of intersectional Russia coverage that could help an audience better understand Russia and America\u2019s imperial aims and how election meddling plays a role in it.\n\nAs soon as Trump is arrested or forced to resign, I fear interest in Russia will fade, and that would be a pity. There has rarely been a better time than now to learn about the complexities of Russian imperialism and the lessons it can teach us about America\u2019s shortcomings at home and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth nations actively vie for world supremacy through a range of tactics, including political interference in some cases and through military force in others. Our media can play a vital role of explaining U.S.-Russia relations within this context. Such deep dives require media outlets and the white men who run them to understand how white supremacy and empire work.\n\n\n\nAnother problem with our media\u2019s fixation on Russia-gate is that other important news stories are getting little to no attention. Trump is belligerently calling for a nuclear arms race. As late as the mid-1980s, there were some 75,000 nuclear weapons in the world, mostly between Russia and the United States. Calm-headed diplomacy between Moscow and Washington, D.C., over the decades cut that figure down to around 15,000.\n\nThe new Nuclear Posture Review clearly shows that America isn\u2019t interested in cutting anymore nukes; nor is Trump interested in using his alleged good relationship with Putin to convince the Russian leader to reverse his own lust for nukes. All eyes are on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but Trump\u2019s love for nuclear weapons may very well convince Russia that there is no need to scale back its arsenal, making the world a less safe place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while politics between Russia and America on Earth are frayed, their relationship in space is strong. Roscosmos, Russia\u2019s space agency, and NASA announced the Deep Space Getaway program last year, part of a larger project to send humans to the moon. It is one of the few areas in which both nations must get along. Exploring why Moscow and Washington are cooperating in space would reveal that the two nations aren\u2019t always at odds and that they do need each other.\n\nAnd as much as the media love to cover Putin as an authoritarian the Russian people foolishly support, it is important to consider that most of white America supported Trump, who seemingly envies his Russian counterpart\u2019s anti-democratic ways. Indeed, Putin and Trump supporters may have a lot in common.\n\nSimply viewing Russia as an attacker of American values without investigating how Americans are destroying them in far worse ways isn\u2019t good Russia reporting. It simply blames Russia for Trump. That is insulting to the Russian people and Americans who know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil mainstream newsrooms make proper paradigm shifts in how they report the complexities of why Russia is doing what it is doing and why Americans are susceptible to it, we\u2019ll continue to suffer through one-sided reporting that indirectly weakens the democracy that American media strive to defend.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "democracy", "russia", "trump", "americas", "moscow", "america", "media", "nuclear", "boring", "russian"], "polarity": 0.06519909237300542, "subjectivity": 0.3877371018675368},

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["negro", "magical", "white", "magically", "movie", "mr", "reasons", "mother", "church", "shit", "does", "charlie", "negrod"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Omarosa was the devil\u2019s best worker and sold her soul to join an administration that cared nothing about anyone who looked anything like her. So why is she here now, and who are the tears for?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s too late for Omarosa to act as if her joining the Trump administration was a mistake. She loaned her blackness to his ministry. She sold her people out for a paycheck. She was one of the few black voices stanning for the president. This was a calculated and concerted effort. She campaigned for this man, spoke on his behalf, issued vague threats and challenged journalist April Ryan, who was only trying to do the Lord\u2019s work for her people.\n\nMake no mistake about it: Everything Omarosa does is calculated. Which is the reason she hopped right out of the White House and onto another reality show. This is her attempt to try to ingratiate her snakelike way into human form. This is merely an attempt to revamp her image, since one thing Omarosa cannot handle is being a nonmotherfucking factor; but in losing her executive-privilege guest pass to the presidential refrigerator, she has also lost her relevancy.\n\nIn spades terms: Omarosa outbid her hand.\n\nIn DJ Khaled terms:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m surprised that she was able to conjure enough emotion and zoo dirt inside the vacant and trampled space where her soul used to be to actually leak human tears. Omarosa\u2019s relevancy ended right about the time when Trump had his folks toss her ass out of the White House, so this swan song of sadness and erstwhile regret\u2014as if she was forced to take a job with a person who has emboldened white supremacy across the country\u2014is not only phony as fuck but also offensive.

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["white", "know", "enemies", "allies", "flight", "world", "need", "speak", "im", "going", "men", "work", "airport", "dont"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Just when you think that the allegations coming from one of the most revered and respected adobes worldwide can\u2019t get any worse, the entire White House\u2014staff, administration, housekeeping\u2014is like, \u201cHold my folders.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the White House was rocked by allegations that Staff Secretary Rob Porter abused two of his ex-wives. The rumors were supported by photos showing one of Porter\u2019s ex-wives with a black eye. Now several sources are reporting that the White House was fully aware of claims that Porter was a serial abuser and not only hired him but also allowed him to continue an untrammeled rise within the administration\u2014including dating Trump\u2019s fake daughter, Hope Hicks, to whom the president affectionately creepily refers as \u201cHopie\u201d and \u201cHopester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, the president knew for months that Porter had been accused of domestic abuse, and even after Tuesday\u2019s bombshell report by the Daily Mail, which included claims that Porter was both verbally and physically abusive to his ex-wives, the White House was still scrambling to keep him on staff.\n\nPorter denied the allegations but resigned Wednesday. The White House, however, announced shortly after his resignation that Porter wouldn\u2019t be leaving the White House immediately, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,\u201d Porter said in a statement provided by the White House, Axios reports. \u201cMy commitment to public service speaks for itself. I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question, why is the White House working so hard to keep Porter on staff? Well, I can\u2019t make this any plainer: Porter is dating Hopie! Hopie is not only the president\u2019s fake daughter (totally normal for this president to have a fake daughter; seriously, there is nothing to see here) but is also considered a member of the untouchable staff, which includes the president\u2019s actual family. CNN notes that before Porter resigned, Hopie, who serves as the White House communications director, helped draft a supportive statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him,\u201d the statement from Kelly reads, CNN reports.\n\nKelly now notes that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the allegations against Porter but stands by his initial statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, get this, CNN notes that the claims against Porter were found during a routine background check by the FBI a year ago. So Porter worked at the White House for a year, worked very closely with the president and his chief of staff, but didn\u2019t have security clearance? Where they do that at?\n\nClearly, President \u201cGrab \u2019em by the Pussy\u201d is no feminist. Hell, he told the repugnantly smug Piers Morgan as much during a recent interview. He\u2019s never been a champion of women\u2019s rights, yet 53 percent of white women voted against their self-interests to put him in office.\n\nThis president is trash, and clearly everyone around him is such. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that the president is flying by the seat of his pants and wearing his KFC bucket on his head because he has no clue what he\u2019s doing in the White House and doesn\u2019t care whom he offends. Porter shouldn\u2019t have needed to resign because he never should have been hired! But they knew that and did it anyway because, well ...

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment.

That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["white", "probably", "know", "things", "guys", "charge", "im", "black", "wrong", "maybe", "men", "stop", "letting", "saying"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

And quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of laying my favorite brands down because the dumb folks in corporate communications elected to take a college course on the importance of Star Wars instead of African-American history.\n\n\n\nSo in an effort to prevent us all from giving up any more good body washes, hair products and cereals, I\u2019ve put together this list of Black Twitter-wrath-proof marketing practices for all those in need.\n\n1. Lay Down Our Edges\n\nThis one is pretty un-fuck-with-able. Forget the wardrobe and accessories\u2014what\u2019s sis\u2019 edges looking like? If a toothbrush wasn\u2019t involved in the making of the hairstyle, go back and try again (please don\u2019t try to understand this logic; just go with it). If a proper gel or styling agent cannot be located, be sure to check with the model. Nine times out of 10, she knew y\u2019all would get it wrong and likely has all necessary styling equipment in her bag, and/or has a homegirl around the corner who can be there in 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Racism Cannot Be Cured With a Kardashian\n\nI\u2019m sure the bronzer, large number of black men, enlarged lips, cornrows and build-a-booties would lead you to believe otherwise, but trust me on this one.\n\n\n\n3. All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s impact vs. intent, and the former overshadows the latter. If you have to apologize, consider issuing an apology in the form of more diverse hires and inclusive marketing practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. When All Else Fails, Just Use the Honey Bunches of Oats Lady or Michelle Obama\n\nWe love the ish out of both of these women and would never question their judgment or discernment. If you\u2019ve got a friend in them, you\u2019ve got a friend in us.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "racism", "things", "marketing", "youre", "black", "mind", "try", "person", "work", "sure", "companies", "dont"], "polarity": 0.05085418348130211, "subjectivity": 0.4227064837234329},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us. This was particularly the case with his Bill Cosby-heavy rape jokes (e.g., \u201cHe rapes but he saves!\u201d), and his weirdly obsessive jokes at the expense of queer and trans folx.\n\nIt was fairly disappointing, to say the least, to see someone willing to push the envelope in one area of oppression (racism) and willfully refusing to adapt to the times in other areas (homophobia and transphobia).\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was surely gonna be an omen of what was to come in 2017: that killing our darlings and letting down our idols was going to be oh so necessary ... as there was absolutely no guarantee that they were going to grow and change with us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what an omen it was.", "keywords": ["white", "2017", "straight", "racist", "black", "women", "woman", "moments", "example", "experienced", "disappointing", "unjust", "simmons"], "polarity": 0.04550587067253737, "subjectivity": 0.4992853288686623},

But the first and most important thing that this capsule should hold is the text of Mark Lilla\u2019s \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism.\u201d\n\nAlthough published in November 2016, several days after Donald Trump was elected president, it managed to be both predictive of 2017 and indicative of it. It\u2019s also perhaps still the most prominent example of a new subgenre of disclosure that was born after the election and spread into 2017, where white people attempt to explain and sympathize with other white people\u2019s problematic political leanings without using the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracism.\u201d\n\nAnd like Citizen Kane and other form-subverting standard-bearers before him, Lilla invented his own rules for this genre by not only ignoring the role that race plays in our cultural and political landscape but also blaming the \u201crhetoric of diversity\u201d\u2014people merely wishing that their racial and cultural differences be respected and acknowledged because, for many of us, it\u2019s literally a lifesaving proposition\u2014for Trump\u2019s rise. As I said in an essay I wrote about this piece last year, he\u2019s the \u201cFrank Lloyd Wright of whitesplaining.\u201d\n\nAnd then what followed in 2017 was example after example of progressive and liberal white people stretching like Elastigirl to explain themselves and their cousins without indicting themselves and failing miserably, showing us their whole entire asses in the process. It was as if all of the cluelessness and obliviousness were gathered together and ground up, mixed into a stew with a generous batch of performative sobriety and then served to us on a slice of avocado toast.\n\nOf course, we\u2014well, most of us\u2014didn\u2019t need liberal white people to remind us that they\u2019re white. This is not something we have the privilege to forget because niggas with selective amnesia get dead. But us not needing to be reminded hasn\u2019t stopped them from trying to. It\u2019s as if they all went to the same convention this year where they were forced to wear name tags that read, \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m white, though,\u201d and they all forgot to take them off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMind you, this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Acknowledgment of the possession of whiteness\u2014and all that it means\u2014is a vital initial step in attempting to rectify America\u2019s race-based wrongs. But what happened instead for many of these liberal whites was that this knowledge wasn\u2019t self-determined.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t them realizing that they\u2019re white. It was everyone else watching them act and react and then acknowledging just how aggressively white these actions were. And then the acknowledgment of whiteness reminded these liberals and progressives that they could always slip back into the safe confines of it when convenient.\n\nPerhaps, when Lilla\u2019s piece is placed in the capsule, we can put it on a slice of avocado toast, too. I\u2019m sure whoever discovers it will be hungry, and what better way to give them an accurate taste of 2017?", "keywords": ["white", "reminded", "wasnt", "theyre", "2017", "example", "liberal", "thing", "slice", "capsule"], "polarity": 0.07625231910946197, "subjectivity": 0.35547825190682325},

Robert E. Lee as \u201can honorable man who gave up his country to fight for his state\u201d\u2014a claim that is categorically untrue.\n\n\u201cMen and women of good faith on both sides made their stand,\u201d Kelly continued during his interview with Ingraham, evoking his boss\u2019s controversial comments about this summer\u2019s deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. At that time, Donald Trump displayed his sympathy toward neo-Nazis and white nationalists by lauding the \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides of the protests. (In retrospect, it\u2019s possible Kelly fed him that line.)\n\nBut the most appalling and dangerous argument Kelly offered Monday night was that a \u201clack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs many finer minds than mine have noted, Kelly\u2019s comments were at once ludicrous, irresponsible, deeply ahistorical and soaked in the vinegar of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more notable responses came from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who delivered a blistering critique on Kelly\u2019s comments in a Twitter thread posted early Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLee wasn\u2019t some agnostic pressed into war. He was a dude who thought torture was cool,\u201d Coates also tweeted, and added an account from one of Lee\u2019s former slaves, written in a recent Atlantic article, about how the honorable general would have saltwater thrown on his slaves\u2019 backs after they were whipped\u2014\u201cnot satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s Civil War comments were shocking to some because the general was always presumed to be the \u201cadult in the room\u201d amid the Trump administration.\n\nHe lost that distinction, widely, when he attacked Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) in the wake of Trump\u2019s controversial call to a Gold Star widow. Calling Wilson an \u201cempty barrel,\u201d Kelly illustrated his disgust with the black lawmaker from Florida with a story about a speech she made that was completely untrue.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen confronted with video evidence of his lie, Kelly didn\u2019t apologize. The episode revealed a lot about the general\u2019s character\u2014about what may have drawn him to Trump in the first place\u2014and busted the myth that he may be some sort of moderating influence on the president.\n\nThere is absolute nothing moderate about \u201ccompromising\u201d on human bondage.\n\nDid Kelly think, as many good white men of his ilk do, that he was being reasonable? That compromise is, in and of itself, a virtue? Or did Kelly, in some way, hope to shift the conversation away from what was by many accounts a long and arduous day at the White House?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as ridiculous and bigoted as Kelly\u2019s comments were, they speak directly to the hearts of Trump\u2019s fervent base. Invoking the honor and virtues of the Confederacy is the sort of cattle call that drove white people to Tennessee to proclaim \u201cWhite lives matter\u201d this weekend.\n\nOr, is it what so many people of color know in this country to be true\u2014that the good white men so often entrusted with protecting and guiding America know the least about it? That they don\u2019t, in fact, care about the country enough to move past their own idealized role in it?\n\n\n\nLee fought against the United States. We don\u2019t teach the Civil War this way because, as with most aspects of our history, Americans are reluctant to face it head-on. The \u201cUnion Army\u201d is a euphemism\u2014it was the U.S. military against which the Confederacy, a separate country, with its own president and its own money and its expressed commitment to keeping and expanding slavery, took arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is who and what Kelly was defending.\n\nKelly\u2019s Civil War comments leave no doubt about who Kelly is. But the real horror, made clear time and time again this year, is that Kelly is certainly not alone, and that good white men and women like him aren\u2019t afraid to follow his lead.\n\n", "keywords": ["john", "white", "trump", "led", "kelly", "comments", "trumps", "country", "war", "civil", "good", "night", "compromise", "lack"], "polarity": 0.10312722103766882, "subjectivity": 0.4952025586353945},

Up yours!\u201d\n\nBut when Joy Reid came at Tucker with actual facts after Carlson invited anti-immigrant Canadian immigrant Mark Steyn on his show to rant about Hispanics turning Arizona into North Mexico, and asked another guest, \u201cHow many big tech companies were started by people from Central and South America?\u201d Carlson could only resort to the tried-and-true tactic of \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn her show, AM Joy, Reid invited Jennifer Mendelsohn on to talk about her research into the family history of prominent immigration foes. Mendelsohn revealed that Carlson\u2019s great-great-grandfather emigrated from Switzerland to America because of the Swiss economy and bleak moneymaking prospects, and Reid accused Carlson of having a \u201cblatantly white nationalist view of what immigration should look like.\u201d\n\nTucker wasn\u2019t having that shit. He dug into his bag of facts and emerged with a rebuttal that amounted to \u201cI\u2019m rubber, you are glue ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKicking off his argument with the lie that he is at war with \u201cproponents of open borders,\u201d the expert squinter went on to explain how \u201cReid\u2019s entire public career has been built on race-baiting.\u201d (Calling opponents of Trump\u2019s ethnic cleansing plan \u201cproponents of open borders\u201d is like calling pro-choice advocates \u201cbaby-murderers\u201d \u2026 oh, wait. They actually do that.)\n\n\u201cReid can\u2019t explain why this country so badly needs to import millions of additional poor people,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody on the left can explain that because there\u2019s no real answer, so they attempt to short-circuit the conversation with slurs.\u201d\n\nI have to side with Tucker on this one. There is absolutely no reason for Reid to call Tucker a \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d except for the fact that Carlson repeatedly invites white nationalists on to demonize immigrants of color, espouses white nationalist views (because he never talks about white immigrants like his great-great-granddaddy or the aforementioned Canadian immigrant) and bellows the white nationalist talking point about America\u2019s \u201cidentity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo aside from the fact that Tucker fits the definition of white nationalism, Reid must be \u201crace-baiting.\u201d Now that I think about it, I\u2019m putting all of my bitcoins on Tucker Carlson to wave the green flag at the race war. Maybe you should, too.\n\nYou can take that to the bank because, according to Tucker Carlson, I\u2019m a racist.\n\nTrust me, he would know.", "keywords": ["wants", "white", "know", "tucker", "beefing", "america", "start", "war", "nationalist", "im", "reid", "joy", "hes", "race", "carlson"], "polarity": -0.004967037319978491, "subjectivity": 0.3494510935687406},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

The Brooklyn College professor\u2019s most recent paper explored the challenges white teachers face while trying to connect with students in large urban school districts. It also contained all the right buzzwords to be swept up in the right-wing media\u2019s ever-escalating culture war.\n\nAfter the self-styled watchdog Campus Reform blogged about Rubel\u2019s paper on Jan. 8, it was subsequently picked up on conservative, alt-right, and neo-Nazi outfits, including The American Spectator, InfoWars, Breitbart, Stormfront, Frontpage, and Fox News, among others. Rubel\u2019s photograph was plastered across TV\u2019s largest cable news channel without a request for her to comment. She and her colleagues were bombarded with sexist and anti-Semitic hate mail and phone calls. The top of her Google results are now largely populated by this faux story.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSplinter spoke with Rubel this week about the research that set it all off\u2014and what it\u2019s like to be at the center of an alt-right media firestorm. Her remarks have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nUsually when we publish papers, almost nobody has access to them. They\u2019re behind a paywall for everyone besides university students or faculty, and no one is going to pay $50 to read something. But this particular journal happened to be an open-access online journal, so everyone could click on it or do simple keyword searches through Google Scholar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this article, which I published in late December, I profile three teachers who are really excellent at what I and other people call dominant practices\u2014helping people access mathematics, like in after-school programs and summer camps. But they have a lot more trouble with critical practices, which are harder to do and especially hard for white people to do. Those are connecting mathematics to the everyday lives of your students, particularly when your students come from communities that you know nothing about and might even be afraid of.\n\n\n\nFox News ran two stories. One clip brought on a student who doesn\u2019t know me and has never met me, as if he has some kind of perspective. But they didn\u2019t even ask me to speak for myself. It was unbelievable\u2014there\u2019s just no news here. They want me to be fired.\n\nI made the argument that the fact these people I profiled are white teachers makes it more challenging, because changing their behavior or the way the system works would be going against the status quo of how white teachers tend to treat black and brown kids: not trying hard enough, not doing their homework, not having enough grit. The status quo sort of blames them for not doing well on math assessments. I\u2019m speaking as someone who\u2019s white, so I\u2019m part of that, too. I\u2019m pointing my finger at all of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the first Thursday of January, Campus Reform contacted me by email, asking if I would be available to comment on an article they were doing about my work. And I thought, Do I want to talk to them? I don\u2019t think that anything I can say is going to make it better.\n\n\n\nI had the weekend to wait for it. I had never looked at the site before but started nervously checking it every day. The paper had all types of things that could make certain people enraged. It seems they were definitely looking for \u201cwhiteness.\u201d It was right at the beginning of my paper\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem like they read the rest of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was watching Campus Reform\u2019s ticker of how many times the article was shared and it was just exploding. I\u2019m there thinking, Oh my god. Why are people posting this? They also linked to my faculty web page and right there is my phone number and email address. Immediately, emails and phone calls started coming in.\n\n\n\nThey were things like, \u201cYou are a retarded POS idiot\u2014you are a libtard US jew...more despicable than knee-grows. Keep making excuses for moronic thugs you asshole cunt.\u201d I got more than a hundred like that. Some asked me to go out on a date and also said they wanted to kill me in the same message. Some of the emails were CC\u2019d to the college president and CUNY chancellor, saying that I should be fired. And people were even sending emails with their corporate signature still attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt kept snowballing. The Daily Mail picked it up. Then Breitbart picked it up. And from there, it went to Fox News. No one ever reached out to me other than the original student at Campus Reform. I kept finding these things only because I kept Googling, wondering when it was going to stop.\n\n\n\nFox News ran two stories. One clip brought on a student who doesn\u2019t know me and has never met me, as if he has some kind of perspective. But they didn\u2019t even ask me to speak for myself. It was unbelievable\u2014there\u2019s just no news here. They want me to be fired.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey had their usual headline and photograph, as if there was some act or evil or violence. They were really trying to make fun of me. What that seemed to be signaling is showing everyone that I was a woman.\n\n\n\nA lot of the original comments at Campus Reform were all written with male pronouns. I guess because it\u2019s math they assumed I\u2019m a man, which I found amusing. After Fox started showing my photograph, it turned into, This is a Jew. They went after me for being gay.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHad I been in New York I think I would have called the NYPD or campus security to figure out some sort of plan. But the universe took care of me somehow; this happened when I was not in New York\u2014I\u2019m on leave with a Fulbright\u2014and I feel perfectly safe.\n\n\n\nThe professional organizations, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators, stepped out really quickly and wrote statements in support of my work. My colleagues wrote letters. My school gave me the indication that they heard me and were paying attention. Our union at the City University of New York wrote a very strong statement. But I didn\u2019t get any response from CUNY. I can only imagine that they\u2019re trying to take care of the institution as best they can and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t speak out. But the attack is as much on them as it is on me.*\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this for 10 years. Whenever I click that button to send that final document, I always ask myself, \u2018Is this something I can live with? If this is something that\u2019s going to get me attacked, is it worth it?\u2019\n\nCampus Reform contacted me again last Thursday. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their usual MO\u2014to keep sending messages to keep you on heightened alert. They had questions about the nature of the funding of the project. But there\u2019s been no new piece. Maybe there is no piece.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrelevant that I was talking about math. In the worldview of some people, math is so neutral and objective, and in their worldview, me talking about race and equity in the context of math sounds insane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in the \u201880s and early \u201890s, there were the Math Wars, which were really contentious political arguments. That was before the internet. Now the right is building out this path. It\u2019s taken them a long time for them to find us\u2014the people who work on social justice in math education\u2014but they\u2019re finding us.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this for 10 years. Whenever I click that button to send that final document, I always ask myself, Is this something I can live with? If this is something that\u2019s going to get me attacked, is it worth it?\n\nI don\u2019t want us to forget about what the real issue is: What\u2019s going on in our schools, particularly New York City schools. I want people to be more enraged about that. That should be the thing that makes us unable to sleep at night. I\u2019m OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate, 1:54 p.m.: CUNY Spokesperson Frank Sobrino declared the public university system\u2019s support for Rubel in a statement to Splinter.\n\n\u201cCUNY stands firmly behind Brooklyn College professor Laurie Rubel, whose work has been recognized by the National Science Foundation and the Fulbright Scholars program, among others,\u201d Sobrino said. \u201cThe university is committed to academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas and expression of all points of view.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "feels", "university", "firestorm", "mathematics", "center", "im", "media", "going", "teachers", "campus", "work", "math", "rightwing", "reform"], "polarity": 0.07822699953767916, "subjectivity": 0.4401744210482074},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled.

You look concerned. Is something wrong?\n\nI was just about to ask you the same question, bruh. Are you OK? I just saw a bunch of tweets that didn\u2019t make sense. They were calling you racist, and they mentioned Toyotas, and something about The Tonight Show band and the place where you work. It really didn\u2019t make sense, so I thought I\u2019d come directly to you.\n\nOh, that? Yeah, Tucker Carlson is beefing with The Root for being racist against white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, who is Tucker Carlson?\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nThat\u2019s all you got\u2014he\u2019s a white man?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to minimize Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson is not just a white man; he\u2019s the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you hear black people say, \u201cThe white man is a motherfucker,\u201d they\u2019re probably talking about Tucker Carlson. If you looked up \u201cwhite man\u201d in some dictionaries, there\u2019s just a picture of Carlson. He\u2019s such an unremarkable white man, the universe named him after a penis-hiding process. Tucker!\n\nEverything about him screams white. He thinks he\u2019s smarter than he really is. He pretends he\u2019s not racist, but everyone knows he is. His face is always adorned with a Lord Petyr Baelish-like smirk that is a mixture of evil, arrogance and bitch-ass-ness. He has a show on Fox News even though he\u2019s not especially interesting, good-looking or talented. He\u2019s perfectly mediocre. There\u2019s only one way to describe him:\n\nTucker Carlson is a white man.\n\nBut what does that have to do with you? Or The Root? Or racism. Or Corollas? I\u2019m still confused.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\n\nOn Wednesday at 11:09 a.m., I received a perfectly mediocre email from the head booker at Tucker Carlson Tonight (notice the perfectly mediocre name of the show). They requested an interview, saying: \u201cWe often see your pieces in The Root, and we\u2019d be interested in discussing many of the themes relating to race in our country that you often analyze.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seems perfectly mediocre. So you told them \u201cyes\u201d?\n\nWell, as soon as I read the email, my \u201cnigga senses\u201d started tingling.\n\nYour what?\n\nMy nigga senses. You see, there are many black people who possess a superherolike sense of detecting white fuckery from afar. Whenever I smell Caucasian shenanigans, I feel a tingling at the tips of my fingers and toes. Some people, including my doctor, think I should be tested for the gout, but trust me, it\u2019s a superpower. It\u2019s like Spider-Man\u2019s spidey senses. When I first discovered them, I put in an application with the X-Men, but they haven\u2019t called back. I know it\u2019s because Wolverine be hating on me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did you do when you felt the tingling?\n\nI did what any smart black man should do: I asked a black woman\u2014specifically, my editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton. I knew she would give me a thoughtful, well-reasoned, educated response.\n\nAnd what did she say?\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it. Issa trap.\u201d\n\nThose were her exact words. So I emailed the Tucker Carlson show with a keenly worded email detailing my hesitation to appear on the show. I think my response illustrated my feelings that I don\u2019t think productive conversations about race can be had in four-minute segments. Furthermore, I know Fox News tries to include black people so it can make it seem like it\u2019s not racist to its racist audience. I\u2019m not saying that everyone who watches Fox News is a racist. I\u2019m just saying that all racists watch Fox News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also think I perfectly outlined my recollection that the last time I was asked to appear on Fox News, on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show, I was replaced by Tariq Nasheed after I declined. I believe my email succinctly summed up my apprehensions.\n\nThat\u2019s dope. It must have been a long email. Can you read it to me?\n\nNo problem; I know it by heart. My email to Tucker Carlson Tonight read:\n\n\u201cNah, fam. I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nWow. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re mad? Because you didn\u2019t come on the show?\n\nNo, it gets better. It turns out, my nigga senses were right. It was a trap. They wanted to lure me on the show to talk about why The Root hates white people so much. Check out these clips:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, they wanted me to explain why it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nDamn, that\u2019s cold. But I still don\u2019t understand what this has to do with Questlove, Black Thought or Priuses.\n\nWell, Tucker Carlson decided that his viewers should boycott The Root and our sponsors. One of our sponsors is Toyota. So Carlson decided to do what Sean Hannity did when he convinced the dumb whites (my least favorite flavor of vanilla) to smash their Keurig coffee machines. But Fox News viewers are the people who voted for an alleged pedophile who rode a horse to the polls, so they aren\u2019t as internet-savvy as you would think. So this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhere I imagine Black Thought is checking his Twitter feed and wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nSo are you upset that you are being painted as a racist?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Some people will say that I am a coward for not going on Carlson\u2019s show to face him and defend myself. I have no need to explain myself, my writings or anything on The Root to a bunch of people whose minds won\u2019t be changed in 40-second sound bites by a black guy they invited on so the host could paint him as anti-white anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd why would I smear Tucker Carlson\u2019s mediocre whiteness as racist?\n\nI have written a lot of incendiary things about white people. I won\u2019t shy away from that. I have called white people racist and made fun of their dancing skills, their potato salad and how often they shoot up schools. I created the Wypipo Awards and held an entire Wypipo Tournament to find the worst of the worst. But none of the articles Tucker Carlson listed were written by me!\n\nHe literally called a random black guy to explain why the works of another black guy were racist. Which. Is. Racist. But you know ... I guess we all write alike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut is The Root racist against white people?\n\nDammit, man! You\u2019re going to make me reveal the secret to our sauce. OK, I\u2019ll reveal it, but make sure you don\u2019t tell anyone. Here it is: No one at The Root hates white people. We hate racism. We are often called racists because of an old Southern saying: \u201cA hit dog will holler.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\nIt means if you throw a rock into a pack of dogs, only the one who is hit will let out a yelp. The rest just go on about their business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman once took umbrage with my portrayal of white people, called me a \u201cblack gangbanger\u201d and asked me how that made me feel. I told her it did not bother me because I am not a gangbanger. I went about my business. Yet some white people are so racist that when we throw rocks at racism, they think we are targeting white people. They are hit dogs. That\u2019s why they holler.\n\nThe white people hollering at Questlove and driving their Rav4s back to the Toyota dealership will never be killed because The Root racially profiled them. The Root has never sent Fox News viewers\u2019 children to underfunded white schools. The Root doesn\u2019t subject Carlson\u2019s fans to longer prison sentences because they are white. The Root has never issued a travel ban against mediocre white boys or tried to deport the Caucasians who come to our country and take our jobs. But, to be fair, the entire staff at The Root wouldn\u2019t mind if someone built a wall around Fox News, but we don\u2019t have the funding.\n\nAnd some of them, we suppose, are good people.\n\nSo how will you settle this?\n\nWe probably won\u2019t. Historically, white people don\u2019t have a long record of taking shit back. Plus, the idea of a hip-hop beef between Fox News and The Root seems like fun. I don\u2019t know if Carlson is P. Diddy or Suge Knight in this scenario, but I bet Carlson won\u2019t be talking that shit when I roll up with The Root staff and the X-Men in my used 4Runner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you don\u2019t feel bad at all?\n\nI\u2019ll be honest. There was one small part of the clip that made me feel a little bad about this entire Caucasian kerfuffle: when Tucker Carlson looked into the camera and said this:\n\nAttacking people on the basis of their race is wrong. That was the standard, and for a long time almost everybody in America believed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t lie.

Mckesson and BLM were in Baton Rouge to protest the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling. The cop claimed that he was hit in the face with a rock by one of the protesters\u2014an assault, he said, that was directed by Mckesson.\n\nBut on Sept. 28, a federal judge threw out the suit because the officer couldn\u2019t provide any evidence that Mckesson incited the violence.

Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns. Senators and members of the House who aren\u2019t lackeys of the terrorist organization called the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the most effective weapon against a bad guy with a gun is the one thing we all seem to lack:\n\nCommon sense.", "keywords": ["gun", "commonsense", "shootings", "bad", "weapons", "guns", "states", "laws", "mass", "idiotic", "broken", "control", "argument", "nonsense", "number", "guy"], "polarity": 0.025412310435895345, "subjectivity": 0.5370657382449834},

The store owner, Vance Hopkins, refused to sell Mason a gun because ... umm ... well, Hopkins didn\u2019t give a reason on the video, but in the two-minute clip, Mason said that the owner declined to sell him a firearm because Hopkins claimed to have \u201creason to believe\u201d Mason would sell it to someone else.\n\nThe video shows Mason turning to a man behind the counter who appears to work at the gun store (and \u201ctackle shop\u201d\u2014just in case you like to go fish-shooting) and asking how many times he had purchased firearms at the store.

Essentially, there\u2019s an overwhelming sense of dread that, based on impending demographic trends, has old white people especially worried about their place in the food chain.\n\nWhite people are afraid of becoming a minority and, thus, afraid of all the negative connotations that come with the minority status they\u2019ve placed on others. They\u2019re afraid that when they lose their numerical advantage to the \u201cothers,\u201d we\u2019re going to mete upon them what\u2019s been foisted upon us.\n\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re totally right to worry.\n\nWe\u2019re definitely coming for them. Black people have been planning the revolution for years (hint: It won\u2019t be televised).\n\nOh, yes, it\u2019s the statues first, and after we\u2019ve yanked all those metal mothafuckin\u2019 monuments down, we\u2019re coming to finish the job on white people in total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose two New Black Panthers outside the Philadelphia polling station in 2012? That was the advance team. Your grandparents tried to warn you, but you didn\u2019t listen.\n\nTo put it simply, as soon as we find out that white people are no longer a majority (we have a Google alert set), we\u2019re kicking off the revolution. It\u2019s coming. Fox News has been right this whole time. That said, this article is strictly based on discussions being held within the black delegation. We haven\u2019t finalized any plans\u2014nor have we been in consultation with our friends from the Latinx, Asian or Native American organizations\u2014but we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019re all working on some level of demographic-based revenge.\n\nIf you\u2019re white and you\u2019re reading this, this is your warning. If you\u2019re black, think of this as our blueprint for a new America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re shutting down the comments section.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest\u2014there\u2019s always some racist shit going down in the comments section. If we\u2019re gonna get really real, we could probably draw a direct line between racists being empowered to publicly vent racist shit in comments sections and the ascension of an openly racist president. There\u2019s something to be said about the anonymity of the internet and the anonymity of the voting booth that emboldens people to dispense with their pleasant facades and embrace the hate within.\n\nNah, fuck all that. The revolution demands that you say that shit to our faces.\n\nThe days of talking that white supremacy shit in a safe place are over. Say goodbye to Yelp, too. Black folks don\u2019t fuck with snitches like that, so that whole thing gotta go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re putting kale back in its place.\n\nSo we\u2019re clear and there\u2019s no room for ambiguity, kale is trash food. It\u2019s a tired-ass leaf that used to be cheap and folks didn\u2019t care about it. In fact, when I was a kid, nobody liked to eat Aunt Evangeline\u2019s greens because she put too much kale in that shit.\n\nThen white people discovered kale, and it went from being a garnish to some shit I gotta pretend to like enough to spend $68 on it in a salad. I\u2019m submitting a paper for consideration for the Nobel Prize in economics on the nexus of the pernicious effects of gentrification and unchecked white-people shit, and it\u2019s just gonna be 200 printed pages of the word \u201ckale\u201d in 24-point font.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuck that.

Overtly racist, covertly sexist, and throwing good dollar after bad trying to pretend like it ain\u2019t while everyone else pretends it\u2019s credible and respectable. Watching Fox & Friends in the morning is the intellectual equivalent of attending a White Citizens\u2019 Council meeting in the 1960s South. For a black person, looking at Steve Doocy\u2019s shit-eating grin for more than six minutes will generate a level of Afro-ire that can cause one to contemplate whether reverse racism is, in fact, a thing because the anger is so irrational.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why the revolution needs Keith David as our collective mouthpiece. His voice conveys such gravitas, such wisdom and such don\u2019t-fuck-with-me force that it\u2019s impossible not to take anything he\u2019s saying seriously and actionably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, we\u2019re even thinking about having a weekend roundtable show called We\u2019re Tired of This Monkey Shit, featuring David, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Lewis and Clifton Powell splitting a pack of menthols whilst explaining the monkey shit that they\u2019re tired of and that needs to immediately cease.\n\nWe have a strong feeling the revolution is gonna spark a lot of bullshit, horseshit and monkey shit, and this kind of unflinching commentary will be necessary.\n\nWe\u2019re moving Black History Month to the summer.\n\nFor barbecue purposes.\n\nWe\u2019re gonna save a few white people.\n\nBecause the revolution is compassionate and some white people have gone above and beyond in their commitment to blackness, we\u2019re granting a reprieve to a select group:\n\nSteve Kerr because he brought a chip to Oakland, Calif.

And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle go out in his truck and shoot [the gunman] and hit him and neutralize him,\u201d Trump said, referring to Stephen Willeford, the Texas man credited with shooting and chasing off the Sutherland gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nThis point\u2014a common conservative refrain\u2014is worth pausing on.\n\nShockingly, there is a bit of nuance that Trump inadvertently introduces. Per our current gun laws, Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, should never have had a gun in the first place. Kelly\u2019s domestic violence charges were never entered into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and buy firearms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is important to remember: We can have the right laws in place, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not being enforced properly.\n\nStill, the focus on the \u201cgood guy with the gun\u201d being unable to purchase his firearm is ridiculous\u2014there is simply no way of knowing that for sure. News outlets are reporting that Willeford had a rifle and not the sort of semi-automatic weapon that would likely be subject to \u201cextreme gun vetting.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Willeford, as a former National Rifle Association instructor, was also a highly trained marksman, which is not true of many gun owners.)\n\nProclaiming that \u201chundreds\u201d more could have died, so we must be glad that only 26 lives were lost, is shameful and indicates how normalized mass murder has become in the U.S. As USA Today reports, 208 people have died in mass shootings this year alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reporter asked Trump whether he would consider any gun control policy.\n\n\u201cThe city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,\u201d Trump answered, brandishing a favorite and demonstrably false response that, in fact, highlights the need for federal gun regulations.\n\nAs a recent NPR fact check noted, Chicago\u2019s gun laws, while tough, are certainly not the strongest in the country. And while the state of Illinois is tough on guns, its neighboring states, Wisconsin and Indiana, aren\u2019t. Guns, like people, can easily move across state borders, and evidence shows that a significant percentage of Chicago\u2019s guns are trafficked in from states with lax gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than talk about Chicago again, the dotard in chief could very well have used South Korea as an example. The last deadly shootings in the country happened in 2015, in two back-to-back incidents. Immediately following the shootings (quite literally, on the first business day after the last incident), the South Korean government moved to track all guns in the country via GPS.\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["gun", "extreme", "trump", "south", "shooting", "vetting", "difference", "guns", "grit", "cheese", "laws", "reporter", "latest", "mass", "claims", "control", "korea", "demented"], "polarity": 0.05356373256373256, "subjectivity": 0.5341286676286676},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

What is to blame for this? Regarding the recent Texas church massacre, President Donald Trump stated that this was caused by a \u201cmental health problem.\u201d\n\nIn other words, guns don\u2019t kill people ... yeah, let me stop you there and dispel that myth. In 2015, suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. A total of 22,018 people used a firearm to commit suicide. Adding to that number, with the 12,979 homicides that were carried out using a firearm, there were 34,997 total deaths caused by firearm in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only November, but 2017 has been considered the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history. This despite the fact that the 1921 Tulsa, Okla., race riot; the 1923 Rosewood, Fla., massacre; and the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, just to name a few, all had greater tragic losses of life in a single instance in this country.\n\n\n\nFor the record, the current federal definition of a mass killing (pdf) is \u201cthree or more killings in a single incident and must occur in a place of public use.\u201d So far, there have been 112 people killed and 531 people wounded in mass shootings this year. To put it bluntly, guns definitely kill people ... a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s answer to these violent events is a very convenient and plausible excuse for the population as it pertains to mental health because of two things: 1) the population doesn\u2019t know a lot about mental illness to begin with, and 2) they don\u2019t want to know about mental illness. So this seems like it would make sense.\n\nBut people who have more than just a cursory knowledge of mental illness will tell you that this likely isn\u2019t mental illness.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s line of thinking has been a popular excuse for people committing violent crimes and crimes in general. But mental illness is responsible only for 3 to 5 percent of violent crimes. This means that the people who are committing violent crimes are far more likely\u201419 times more likely\u2014not to have a mental illness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good rule of thumb for most things is to understand one main concept: There is a difference between mental illness and bad behavior.\n\n\n\nJust because someone does something that is unusual or not normal to you does not mean, by default, that someone is mentally ill. I get it\u2014these events cause shock, disgust and make you feel sick. However, if there is no evaluation, you should probably err on the side of bad behavior. If the shooter was killed, there is little else to go off of other than family members, who might suffer from recall or responder bias, which makes any evaluation ultimately unreliable.\n\nA person who has not previously been diagnosed with a mental illness and who commits a violent crime is likely not suffering from mental illness and is probably just evil. Yes, I know, there is no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designation for being evil. Which is why being a bad person isn\u2019t a mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is more likely that these are horrible people with poor coping skills ... and access to firearms. Don\u2019t believe me? OK, consider this: If someone shot and killed your relative, what are you thinking of first? That the shooter had a mental illness or that the shooter was simply a horrible person? Exactly.\n\n\n\nNeed another example? OK. What if your roommate was secretly poisoning you and posting on Instagram step-by-step everything she or he did to you? Would you think that your roommate had a mental illness or that your roommate was a horrible person? Too easy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you noticed that with respect to people who commit a violent crime, the benefit of the doubt about whether they\u2019re suffering from mental illness is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in their body?\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of melanin, you are considered a thug, a terrorist and un-American. However, if you have very little melanin, you are mentally ill and are worthy of people suggesting that you had an undiagnosed, and unknown, mental illness, personality disorder or any number of other maladies, and you deserve some compassion.\n\nAfter all, why else would someone with privilege commit a crime? Affluenza, anyone?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not caping for terrorism, foreign or domestic.\n\nHowever, the selective framing and cognitive dissonance that seems to dominate the narrative of these types of incidents makes the optics of perceptions of mental illness and mental health look bad, and it is the wrong way to address these events.\n\n\n\nThe ramification of using mental illness as a scapegoat increases the stigma that is attached to mental illness. This stigma makes people far less likely to seek out professional help to improve their mental health. Not to mention it also increases the criminalization of mental illness, when, in fact, people who have mental illness are 10 times more likely to be the victims of violent crime, not the perpetrators of crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect Congress to do anything about it. It did nothing when the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings occurred in Newtown, Conn. Hell, members of Congress were actually shot at and kept right on going like nothing happened. If they don\u2019t care about their own lives, I am certain they don\u2019t care about yours. But, hey, thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\nNeither thoughts nor prayers are going to be able to stop a bullet or people\u2019s suffering.\n\nBy the way, those survivors and family members of the victims? They are dealing with mental health challenges as they struggle to understand why their loved ones were tragically taken away and why the government repeatedly fails to prevent these senseless losses of life caused by people behaving badly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, if this is a mental health problem, perhaps Trump is to blame, because he did sign into law a bill that rolled back an Obama-administration measure that had made it harder for people with mental illness to procure firearms.\n\n\n\nBut when you have shock, disgust and emotion, who needs facts?\n\n\n\nTerrance McGill, M.D., MPH, specializes in preventive medicine, mental health and addiction medicine. In addition to practicing medicine, McGill is an author and journalist who tries to find new ways to save the world, no matter how much it doesn\u2019t want to be saved.\n\n", "keywords": ["probably", "crime", "illness", "likely", "killed", "violent", "mass", "crimes", "person", "dont", "health", "mental"], "polarity": -0.08169830169830167, "subjectivity": 0.5002043789543794},

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["gun", "american", "violence", "day", "killed", "america", "children", "control", "firearm", "number", "shot", "kids", "study", "texas"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking.

I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

Get lots of black people to buy guns.\n\nI know it seems antithetical, but if black people started purchasing semi-automatic weapons legally and in large numbers, congressional Republicans would pass a gun-owner safety bill faster than white people\u2019s fucking tempo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t even have to actually purchase guns\u2014all we\u2019d have to do is get black people to join the National Rifle Association en masse.

Call gun ownership a form of resistance.\n\nWe need to figure out a way to make the GOP believe that buying guns is a form of protest, because whether it\u2019s black fists at the Olympics, sitting in an empty bus seat, walking across a bridge, sitting down at a lunch counter, marching, kneeling or even saying the words \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d white America has never approved of any form of black protest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes anyone have Colin Kaepernick\u2019s number?\n\n3. Make it cool.\n\nIf black people made mandatory waiting periods or universal background checks cool, white people would appropriate it like they did jazz, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, hip-hop, our dances, our style, our vernacular and everything except our poultry-seasoning techniques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we could get Rihanna to Snapchat herself calling a congressman, you know Kim Kardashian would be on Instagram tomorrow dialing up a senator while wearing a thong and pasties. Then Kendall Jenner would make a commercial featuring her interrupting a class to hand a Mr. Pibb to a white boy in a trench coat about to go on a school shooting spree, thereby saving the day.

I know that\u2019s a shitty, unfunny analogy ...\n\nWhich is exactly why it will be a No. 1 hit for Taylor Swift.\n\n4. We might have to threaten the animals.\n\nThe only thing white people love more than their guns is their pets. They could give a fraction of a fuck about actual human lives, but they will jump in front of a speeding train for a puppy. You literally have to fill out more paperwork to buy a Yorkshire terrier from a pet store than you do to purchase an AK-47 from a gun show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some kind of statistic about how many pets are killed by gunfire every year.

Lie.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that troglodyte, middle-American conservatives will believe anything if you say it loud enough and frequently enough. Somehow, fake facts seep into their porous brains, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps we could pay Rush Limbaugh and Bill O\u2019Reilly to join our cause. Those bastards would do anything for money. They could tell their followers there is a little-known clause in Obamacare that allows people to trade abortions for banana clips.

He also was a former deputy chairman of the Freedom Forum, as Tyler Vazquez reported Tuesday for Florida Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor legions of journalists of color, Quinn was more.\n\n\u201cIt is going to take a while for me to get my thoughts in one space because this remarkable human being taught me that I did not have to be on guard because of my race or gender,\u201d Karen Howze, a former Gannett editor who found a second career as a judge, wrote below Ivory\u2019s post on Facebook. \u201cHe always knew the temper of the time and read all so well.\n\n\u201cThere are so many conversations where he and his wife relied on those like me but he also puzzled about some of crab in the bucket dynamics that affected all those he championed. . . . He was my boss. My friend a second family member before I left the business and after. . . . He was and will always be the real. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sentence in a tribute Wednesday from Colleen Fitzpatrick at the Newseum Institute wasn\u2019t about his broader accomplishments, but that Quinn and his wife, Lois, \u201cfounded one of the premier journalism diversity programs in the country after he retired from a newspaper career. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chips Quinn Scholars program, named for the couple\u2019s eldest son and funded by the Newseum Institute, has provided training and internships to nearly 1,400 student journalists of color since its founding in 1991.\n\n\u201c \u2018The Chips Quinn program has changed the face and fabric of newsrooms across the country thanks to John and Loie Quinn\u2019s vision and commitment to diversity,\u2019 said Kristen Go, a 1996 and 1997 Scholar,\u201d referring to Lois Quinn by the name she was commonly called. \u201c \u2018The program gave me the confidence in my skills, support to grow as a journalist and the idea to dream big \u2013 that one day, I could become a top newsroom editor who could hire other Chips Quinn Scholars.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuinn walked the walk on diversity and helped pave the sidewalk.\n\nWhen USA Today commemorated its 25th anniversary in 2007, Quinn explained to Journal-isms how the newspaper assembled its inaugural staff.\n\n\u201cIt was a little frustrating,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cSome of my colleagues would say, \u2018I know this great person who can do what we want.\u2019 We said, \u2018We\u2019ve got a lot of those; we\u2019ve got to have somebody else.\u2019 \u201d And sometimes that meant going outside Gannett, the nation\u2019s largest newspaper company, to find them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe percentage of people of color at USA Today\u2019s founding, Quinn said, exceeded that of the nation as well as the newspaper industry. Of the five managing editors, two were women. At the level below them were two more women and two African Americans. The average age was 30. \u201cMore important, we had the talent we needed,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWanda Lloyd, another retired Gannett editor of color, said then, \u201cUSA Today really set the pace for this industry in terms of content diversity. It was perceived by some, including readers, as going too far.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe paper had a rule that a person of color and a woman had to be on the front page, above the fold, every day.\u201cWhat that did was, because USA Today\u2019s Page One is kind of a billboard for the rest of the newspaper, it forced the rest of the newspaper to be diverse. You had to have people of color in Life and women in Sports.\u201d\n\nIf African Americans did not rise above the deputy managing editor level, Quinn said, they went elsewhere within Gannett to become publishers and editors.\n\nIn a USA Today tribute Tuesday, Rick Jervis, a Cuban American from Miami and a 1993 Chips Quinn Scholar, recalled feeling as though he didn\u2019t belong at Freedom Forum headquarters in Arlington, Va., where the program was based.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was put at ease. Later, he worked at the Miami Herald, where he was part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team, then left to freelance in Eastern Europe.\n\nJervis wrote of Quinn, \u201cI leaned on him for career counseling and overall support. After returning to the U.S., I went and spoke to new Chips Quinn scholarship winners. Each time, Quinn and Loie welcomed me back with hugs, like family members. I was in constant awe at the energy and ambition he instilled in the scholarship winners, the sense of belonging. He memorized names, hometowns, colleges.\n\n\u201cIn one of my last communications with him, 12 years ago, I wrote to him to tell him I had accepted a job at USA TODAY, his alma mater. It was probably his proudest of my accomplishments. I still have his hand-written reply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cQuinn\u2019s passing will be felt in newsrooms across the USA as hundreds of journalists remember the perched glasses and smiles that greeted them during their nerve-racking scholarship run. In today\u2019s age of alternate facts and fake news allegations, his lessons are more pertinent than ever.\u201d\n\nRecalling Quinn\u2019s instructions, Jervis concluded, \u201cWe should all remember to pursue the truth, write short, and never forget we belong. Thanks again, John. . . .\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick, a career coach with the Chips Quinn program since 2000, reported that \u201cThe funeral will be held on Saturday, July 15th from the Carolina Mill at 9 a.m. with mass at St. Mary\u2019s Church (437 Carolina Back Road) in Carolina at 10 a.m. Burial will be at White Brook Cemetery in Carolina.

In addition to lawsuits accusing the cable news network of \u2018abhorrent, intolerable, unlawful and hostile racial discrimination,\u2019 there have also been allegations of sexual harassment.

See who is speaking here. Read and hear all 30 stories here.\u201d\n\nThe Star-Ledger, headquartered in Newark, is part of NJ Advance Media. Just before the eruption, Editor Mort Pye assigned three African Americans in the Star-Ledger newsroom, this columnist included, to survey the mood of Newark\u2019s black community, given conflagrations in other cities. The unrest exploded in the middle of our reporting, and a \u201cwhy the riot happened\u201d piece was published on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal-isms author was still a college student, working part-time at the newspaper. Ernest Johnston Jr., the Star-Ledger\u2019s only full-time black reporter and its first, later worked at the New York Post, the Amsterdam News, the Jersey Journal and the National Urban League before his death in 2000 at age 61. Charlie Dryden was a copy aide, then called a \u201ccopy boy.\u201d The title was later changed throughout newsrooms to avoid shouting \u201cboy!\u201d at black men who held the job.\n\nIn his memoir \u201cBlack Is the Color of My TV Tube,\u201d the late New York television journalist Gil Noble wrote about his sudden employment opportunity at New York\u2019s WABC-TV, flagship of the ABC network, Todd Steven Burroughs recalled in 2011 for Black Agenda Report.\n\nNoble made reference to the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, which shook the news media in 1968 with its declaration that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training, and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The mass media had been caught with their zippers down,\u2019 wrote Noble. \u2018Red-faced executives scurried about, seeking Blacks for on-air and other job activities. What more logical place to find Black media persons than the so-called soul stations and newspapers? Within a year, many of us found ourselves downtown at major radio and TV stations....None of the stations said we were being hired because of the prescriptions of the Kerner Commission\u2019s report. They all maintained, and they still do, that they are committed to being equal-opportunity companies. If asked about pressure, they would say, \u2018What pressure?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is also not mentioned by these employers, but mentioned by Noble and other Black journalists of his generation, is that they were needed for another reason: White journalists, many of whom had never taken the time to cover Black communities adequately, were understandably and correctly getting their tails kicked while trying to cover those that were exploding in 1967 and 1968.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter a brief tryout, Noble\u2019s hiring by WABC was cinched when he was sent to cover the Newark rebellion. \u2018The news director had decided to hire me,\u2019 wrote Noble. \u2018I wearily returned home to tell my wife the good news and was acutely aware of the countless brothers and sisters who were still encircled within the National Guard barricades. Their uprising had been at least partially responsible for my new employment.\u2019 When King was assassinated less than a year later, WABC made another decision: he would contribute to a new Sunday program. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Kerner report led to training programs for journalists of color and increased hiring.\n\nAs reported in this space last week, a panel at the joint convention of the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Associated Press Photo Managers this fall will discuss \u201cKerner Commission at 50: What did we get right?

But fine words on diversity need to be matched with firm actions \u2013 and this week\u2019s One Thing details my plans to ensure our company recruits, retains and rewards a diverse workforce.\n\n\u201cIn the immediate term, I am in the process of hiring a diversity and inclusion specialist to lead, audit and advise on diversity issues across Dow Jones. It is imperative that we both understand our own data and act upon it with reference to the very best of practice. The diversity and inclusion specialist will put in place the infrastructure we need to support our diversity and inclusion efforts. This will feature a Diversity & Inclusion Council, drawn from staff across the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPromoting gender equality within our company will be the critical, initial focus. This is not the limit of our ambition in promoting diversity \u2014 rather, it is a starting point. Thanks in part to the cultural diagnostic work, which so many colleagues took part in and that we carried out at the start of the year, I recognize that other areas \u2013 such as ethnicity, sexual orientation, flexible working, disability and veteran status \u2014 are all issues and opportunities that need to be championed.\n\n\u201cThe need, though, to improve the career chances and choices of women is pressing. I am, of course, committed to ensuring pay equity across the company and this process continues, as evidenced by the recently completed second annual review. Analysis showed that an additional 2% of our employees needed further adjustments to their salaries to better align with others in similar roles and at similar levels. This included both men and women and spanned multiple ethnicities. But pay equity is only part of the issue. I will, therefore, also introduce a new Accelerated Management Program for women \u2013 initially for 25 candidates drawn from different departments. This program will help develop, coach and mentor individuals to advance and accelerate their careers at Dow Jones and beyond.\n\n\u201cBased on work already underway and the efforts of our new diversity and inclusion expert, I will also set a new, company-wide target of executive-level women for every Dow Jones department. As things stand, I will set this target at 40% initially. This will be the first of a number of diversity goals I will identify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo be clear, diversity and inclusion will be fundamental to our future success. We need to draw upon a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas to ensure we stay relevant and responsive to our customers.

Receives First Seed Grant\n\nSupport for Idea of Slavery as Motivation for 1776\n\nA Host Advises on Conducting That Great Interview\n\nVirgil Smith, Ex-Gannett V.P., Starts Opinion Site\n\nFusion Website Rebrands as Splinter\n\nShort Takes\n\nAnti-Migrant Government Extended Warm Welcome\n\nAt least three American journalists of color \u2014 Darlene Superville of the Associated Press, Abby Phillip of the Washington Post and Toluse Olorunnipa of Bloomberg News, accompanied President Trump on his trip to Europe for the Group of 20 summit meeting this week, but no journalist quite had the perspective of Remi Adekoya.\n\nAdekoya, who writes for Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper and is former political editor of the Warsaw Business Journal, is described as Polish-Nigerian, meaning his father is Nigerian and his mother Polish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe grew up in Nigeria but worked in Poland, where black people were scarce. Adekoya was on hand Thursday to describe for listeners of the American program \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d why Trump would choose Poland as the first stop on his tour. Trump said there that \u201cWestern civilization\u201d was at stake.\n\n\u201cPoland is one of the main countries which refused to take in any migrants during the 2015, 2016 migrant crisis in Europe, when suddenly a million refugees found themselves in Europe,\u201d Adekoya said. \u201cSo, this \u2014 so, the fact Trump made this speech in Poland is significant. He would not, most probably, have been able to make this kind of speech in Western Europe to the kind of reception which he did get in Poland, which was very positive. And like I said, supporters of this right-wing government were basically shouting, \u2018Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\u2019 throughout the speech.\u201d Many of those supporters were bused in, Adekoya said.\n\nHost Amy Goodman asked about his background. \u201cI was born in Nigeria, lived there for the first 17 years of my life,\u201d Adekoya replied. \u201cThen I moved to Poland in 1995 as a student and lived there for\u2014living there from since then, essentially. Now I shuttle between the U.K. and Poland. And, yes, that\u2019s it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the changes in Poland. When I arrived in Poland, the country was just six years out of communism. There were very few foreigners in the country, as you can imagine, definitely very few black people.\n\n\u201cThings weren\u2019t always very pleasant. With time, things improved regarding the treatment of foreigners and treatment of black people. I mean, there was a time in the mid to late \u201890s when you could hardly walk on the street without hearing a racial insult hurled at you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut towards the early 2000s, some 10 years after the end of communism, and when Poland joined the EU finally in 2004, you know, the economy improved, and people\u2019s moods generally improved. Poles got a little bit more used to seeing foreigners on the streets. Those kind of, let\u2019s say, racial insults just hurled on the streets, just like that, stopped, and things improved vastly.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, since this government came back in, the current Polish government, in 2015, they used the migrant crisis of 2015. When there were a million refugees, essentially, within Europe\u2019s borders looking for where to go, they used that crisis to scare Poles into essentially making the argument that, \u2018Look, look at what is happening in France. Look at what is happening in countries like the U.K. They\u2019ve got terrorism there because of all these Muslims who are there. Do we want that? Obviously, we don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo, we can\u2019t allow them\u2014the EU, that is\u2014to push on us, you know, these migrant refugees, these Muslims, and tell us that we have to take care of them, because, essentially, well, maybe while not all Muslims might be terrorists, but some of them definitely are, so why take the risk?\u2019 . . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Adekoya told Journal-isms by email, his skin color proved to be a positive in his work as a journalist there.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, my skin colour worked to my advantage as a journalist in Poland. When I started covering parliament, it was often easier for me to get an interview with a top politician than for Polish journos. The politicians were simply curious about me as the only black journalist they\u2019d ever dealt with! I also got noticed more easily in general in the journalistic world. So it ended up being a plus :)\u201d\n\nMichael Ottey, an African American assignment editor on the foreign/national desk at the Los Angeles Times, has also remarked on Polish reactions to black people. After being laid off in 2009 as assistant foreign editor at the Miami Herald, Ottey decided to travel around the world, filing \u201cMike Tends to Travel\u201d dispatches online as he did so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOttey\u2019s most popular blog, he said, was from 2013: \u201cPOLAND: Stop Staring At Me!\u201d\n\nRemi Adekoya, the Guardian: Poland\u2019s courting of Trump is a few supporters short of a picnic\n\nRemi Adekoya, the Guardian: Privileged Nigerians shouldn\u2019t downplay poverty just because it makes us look bad (Aug. 11, 2016)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToluse Olorunnipa and Margaret Talev, Bloomberg: Trump sits down with Mexico\u2019s president at last\n\nMichael Ottey, Mike Tends to Travel: POLAND: Stop Staring At Me!

A female political analyst who was a frequent guest on the network brought her allegations of sexual misconduct last month to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm investigating harassment claims for Fox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn FBN representative said in a statement that \u2018the matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are taking all of the appropriate steps to reach a resolution in a timely manner.\u2019 . . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe woman\u2019s name is not being disclosed by The Times because her allegations include being coerced into a sexual relationship by Payne.\n\n\u201cPayne, who hosted the nightly FBN program \u2018Making Money,\u2019 criticized the media for the reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Not surprising media outlets that hate President Trump most put out most twisted stories on me,\u2019 Payne tweeted.\n\n\u201cPayne acknowledged to the National Enquirer on Wednesday \u2014 the day before his suspension \u2014 that he was in a three-year \u2018romantic relationship\u2019 with the woman. But he has called the claims of harassment \u2018an ugly lie.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nMaher Links N. Koreans and U.S. Nail Salons\n\n\u201cThe last time HBO comedian Bill Maher surged into national headlines, he was on the job,\u201d Erik Wemple wrote Friday for the Washington Post. \u201cIn an edition of his show \u2018Real Time with Bill Maher,\u2019 the host was trying to be his edgy best in a talk with GOP Sen. Ben Sasse. In response to an invitation from the Nebraskan to come \u2018work in the fields,\u2019 Maher said, \u2018Work in the fields? Senator, I am a house n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndividuals, appropriately, slammed Maher for deploying a racial slur. Though the highly smug host has long deplored public apologies, he managed to eke one out. \u2018Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry,\u2019 said a statement from Maher.\n\n\u201cThis time, Maher doesn\u2019t have the \u2018banter of a live moment\u2019 excuse. Nor does he have much of an excuse on any other front, either. Here\u2019s what he tweeted this afternoon:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough the nail-salon tweet poses no problem vis-a-vis the show\u2019s airings, it does indicate his priorities: Stabs at humor \u2014 extremely lame ones included \u2014 take precedence over everything, including respect for Asians, African Americans, or whatever group the comedian feels like stereotyping today. That he chose to do this while allegedly on vacation reflects his full-time commitment to bigotry.\n\n\u201cHBO didn\u2019t return a request for comment right away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditors to Reflect on 50 Years of Diversity Efforts\n\nA panel at the joint convention of the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Associated Press Photo Managers this fall will incorporate suggestions from Journal-isms readers on how to commemorate a landmark report on integrating the nation\u2019s newsrooms.\n\nFifty years ago next March 1, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, shook the news media with its declaration that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training, and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kerner report, commissioned by President Lyndon B. Johnson in reaction to the urban uprisings of the 1960s, also said, \u201cNews organizations must employ enough Negroes in positions of significant responsibility to establish an effective link to Negro actions and ideas and to meet legitimate employment expectations.\u201d\n\nThe report led to training programs for journalists of color and increased hiring. In 1978, ASNE set a goal of achieving parity in newsrooms with the percentage of people of color in the general population by 2000. Twenty years later, the goal was changed to 2025. The 2000 goal was not met, but \u201cdiversity\u201d is now part of industry language and outreach efforts continue. Ethnic diversity now also includes Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.\n\nJournal-isms asked readers for ideas on how to commemorate the anniversary, then suggested a discussion of the issue at the ASNE-APME-APPM convention in Washington in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organizations have approved such a panel for 9:45 a.m. to 10:55 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 10. \u201cKerner Commission at 50: What did we get right? What\u2019s next?\u201d moderated by Journal-isms columnist Richard Prince, will include veteran journalists:\n\nPaul Delaney, retired senior editor at the New York Times and a co-founder of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAlbert E. Fitzpatrick, a member of ASNE\u2019s Minorities Committee in 1978 when ASNE\u2019s diversity goals were adopted. He has been vice president for diversity at the old Knight Ridder company, NABJ president and executive editor at the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDorothy Gilliam, first African American female reporter at the Washington Post, an NABJ president and former board chair of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education.\n\nCharlayne Hunter-Gault, who in a career of more than 50 years in print and broadcast media was part of the Summer Program for Minority Journalists, which helped train the first group of African American reporters after the Kerner report.\n\nIdeas from Journal-isms readers and others were varied. Nearly all expressed disappointment with progress on diversity. Suggestions included an emphasis on integrating news industry leadership ranks, an idea that ASNE has embraced; collecting journalistic work of black and brown journalists; public conversations between veteran and younger journalists of color, more vigorously measuring diversity progress and, more fundamentally, simply implementing the commission\u2019s recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kerner Commission\u2019s Chapter 15, \u201cThe News Media and the Disorders,\u201d is here: http://bit.ly/2nb8mZr\n\nA brief summary is here: http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/docs/kerner.pdf (Go to Chapter 15.)\n\nAmerican Society of News Editors: ASNE Diversity History\n\nJournal-isms Inc.

He compared the colonists\u2019 drive to that of Ian Smith, who was prime minister of Britain\u2019s rebellious colony of Rhodesia.\n\n\u201cMr. Smith\u2019s resistance to black rule led to a unilateral declaration of independence from Britain in 1965 and, later, severe repression and a seven-year guerrilla war, costing about 30,000 lives, most of them black fighters and civilians,\u201d Alan Cowell of the New York Times wrote when Smith died in 2007.\n\nThe interview with Horne can be heard by clicking on the \u201cArise!\u201d program for 9 a.m. Friday in the \u201carchives\u201d section of the WPFW website.

Hosted by Thorn, the podcast, called \u201cThe Turnaround,\u201d will examine the science and art of journalism.\n\nCornish, the first interviewee, responded to the question above with a tip about what to say when you\u2019re in doubt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause I know the conversation will be edited down, I don\u2019t necessarily have the luxury to go on a fishing expedition,\u201d Cornish said. \u201cSo I often write my questions in advance wherever possible. I rewrite and noodle around with the language even though I know for [a] fact [that] I won\u2019t necessarily read it word for word. And I always have more questions than I need.\n\n\u201cIn fact my poor producers and editors always see me coming in with like a long script, and then I\u2019ll say, \u2018Let\u2019s put a star next to the things that actually matter.\u2019 Like, even though I have 15 questions. Because I want to make sure I at least get the things we absolutely know we want to ask, even if they don\u2019t yield great answers. It\u2019s not that I run out of things to ask, you know what I mean?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more that I have occasionally, where you just like flip over the paper, and you\u2019re just having a good conversation, and one thing leads to another and things can go very easily. When in doubt, I often say something, like, very straightforward, and this is directly from the Sound Reporting handbook. You know\u2026 \u2018What haven\u2019t I asked that I should have?

It launched with much fanfare and a roster of many high-profile names, yet offered little explanation about what it exactly it was. For the last few years, Fusion has trudged along with a few refocuses and layoffs. Most recently it said it would report on social justice.\n\n\u201cWhen Univision bought Gawker (after the site filed for bankruptcy), it almost seemed like Fusion would serve as a place for some [of] its writers who didn\u2019t fit under the Gizmodo or Jezebel umbrellas.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

Over the course of 2017, circumstances have allowed for and presented themselves as ideal moments to always bet on black, per se. And collectively, we did not disappoint.\n\nHere is a list of the 10 blackest moments of 2017 (so far\u2014C.P. Time is a real thing, so we have a week left for the thunder and the rain to come down):\n\nLaVar Ball\u2019s appearance on CNN was equal parts \u201cFuck the man\u201d and \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Love him or hate him\u2014and he is easily one of the most polarizing people in America\u2014Ball basically went on television to tell the motherfucking PREZ-O-DEN \u201cFuck you and the horse Roy Moore rode in on\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing). And I don\u2019t care where you are or who you is; that\u2019s some black shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA film about the black experience won the Oscars\u2019 most coveted prize; and, of course, white folks tried to take it from them because that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be black in America. Moonlight was a film that spurred so many different types of conversations, from whether or not the film was any good (depends on whom you ask) to what the central theme of the movie even was (sexuality or manhood ... manhood, definitely), but when the dust settled, a movie about blackness was a central conversation piece AND the last film standing, and that\u2019s a hell of a win for African America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, 28 members of the Beta Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma Theta at FAMU decided to celebrate 10 years of sisterhood with a trip to Costa Rica. That trip resulted in a photoshoot seen round the world. Dubbed \u201cMelanin Illustrated,\u201d the women all wore similar-toned bathing suits and had all of us appreciating their beautiful blackness. I guess that\u2019s what Rotary Connection was singing about on \u201cI am the Black Gold of the Sun.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, keeping it real goes wrong, but sometimes keeping it real results in a black man using a motherfucking filing cabinet as a grill. I\u2019ve seen some black shit. Hell, I still carry around a Crown Royal bag to hold prized possessions (I really do this), but file-cabinet grilling? That\u2019s some black ingenuity on par with George Washington Carver\u2019s work with peanuts. Somebody get this man a Negritzer Prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Angela Rye responds to Omarosa Manigault being fired from her job at the White House.\n\nWords won\u2019t do this justice; you just need to watch the clip. This is master-class-level petty.

Donald Glover thanks the Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d as part of his Golden Globes acceptance speech for Atlanta.\n\nDonald Glover had a hell of a year. His album Awaken, My Love! (released in December 2016) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. His hit television show, Atlanta, caught the hearts and minds of black America and won Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes in February. And what did Glover do in his thank-you speech? He thanked motherfucking Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d because it\u2019s, like, the best song ever. Migos, who are a black-ass group even down to their familial connections as both uncles and cousins and other super-black shit, saw a huge spike in streams and sales of the single after. That\u2019s paying the blessings forward, which is a black-ass way to give back in our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon Young already did a bang-up job explaining the 20 blackest moments of the Sharon Reed clapback video, so I won\u2019t reinvent the wheel. Finger pistols of death on live television. That\u2019s some black shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

Issa Rae. When asked who she was rooting for at the night\u2019s Emmys, she made it very clear that she was rooting for everybody black (probably one of THE truest statements of all time\u2014also applies to the Olympics, elections and nonblack movies with black characters), setting off a viral round of \u201cYaaaassssssssss\u201d and T-shirts and catapulting her right into position as everybody\u2019s favorite black person for a solid at-least-two weeks. Basically, she was the opposite of Omarosa. The ONLY reason this isn\u2019t No. 1 is because, well, blackness seeks its own level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.

Listen. Sharpe said he likes to celebrate with cigars and yak and put a Black in his mouth ON TELEVISION. Even Joy Taylor knows that Black & Milds aren\u2019t real cigars. But that didn\u2019t stop Sharpe from going on about his love for Hen Dawg and Milds. That, my friends, is blackness seeking its own level. Those are the moments in blackness you don\u2019t see coming, which makes them special. Blackness is not here for you; it\u2019s here for the shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

What\u2019s more, his TV show, She\u2019s Gotta Have It, inspired by his first feature-length film, will debut on Netflix later this week. With all those things bringing his career to mind, I decided to research Lee\u2019s filmography, and two things hit me immediately.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne, dude is mad prolific. Throughout the \u201990s, he virtually made a quality movie every year.\n\n\n\nTwo, his filmography is rather uneven. He has made movies that run the gamut from brilliant (School Daze, Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X) to damn, nigga, really? (Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, Red Hook Summer).\n\n\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of Malcolm X, his most ambitious film, I will offer a ranking of Spike\u2019s 25 best films.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n25. She Hate Me (2004)\n\nThis is not a bad film\u2014just a messy one. It is unfocused and tries to do too much narratively. When it came out, many were confused. They thought they just did not understand what he was up to. Time has revealed that it was not that we did not understand but, rather, to quote Hov, \u201c\u2019Cause you don\u2019t understand him, it don\u2019t mean that he nice.\u201d\n\n24. Oldboy (2013)\n\nThis is a technically proficient film\u2014it is just unneeded. The original is close to perfect. This is just there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23. Miracle at St. Anna (2008)\n\nThis is an ambitious film, but it is overly long. I started watching it when Barack Obama was elected, and when I finished, Donald Trump was in office.\n\n\n\n22. Chi-raq (2015)\n\nLee\u2019s attempt to wrestle with the violence in Chicago is stylish but deeply flawed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n21. Passing Strange (2008)\n\nMore known for his fictional films, Lee is also an accomplished documentarian. This is a recording of \u201cthe best play to never win a Tony,\u201d written by Stew.\n\n\n\n20. Jim Brown: All-American (2002)\n\nJim Brown is a fascinatingly complicated black man, and Lee\u2019s documentary lays that all bare.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth (2013)\n\nThis film surprised me. Mike Tyson is a tragically flawed yet magnetically charismatic man\u2014Lee films him empathetically.\n\n18. Summer of Sam (1999)\n\nThis tells the story of the 1977 serial murders that took place in New York City. It builds suspense competently, but I have no idea what Lee was trying to say with the film. His visuals are jarring, yet what good are the chills if the story leaves so much to be desired?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Get on the Bus (1996)\n\nThis story about black men on a bus to the Million Man March flirts dangerously with emotional manipulation, but the performances of Ossie Davis, Charles S. Dutton, Bernie Mac, Andre Braugher and others save the film from sentimentality.\n\n\n\n16. Clockers (1995)\n\nAn examination of the interconnectedness of those who investigate crimes and those who commit them, Lee\u2019s Clockers is a precursor to The Wire in form and style.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. If God Is Willing and de Creek Don\u2019t Rise (2010)\n\nThis sequel to Lee\u2019s brilliant When the Levees Broke is haunting. It showed us just how much work remained to be done after Hurricane Katrina while examining the impact of the BP oil spill of 2010. His ability to construct a vibrant narrative using the documentary format is on full display in this HBO film.\n\nThe remaining films are what made Spike Lee Spike Lee. The following are all legitimately great films worthy of deep examination and deconstruction. My ranking of his top 14 films changes almost yearly, but I am willing to go to blows with anyone who denies their brilliance\u2014even while I am willing to admit that they are not all flawless in their execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. 25th Hour (2002)\n\nA rarity for Lee in that almost exclusively white actors populate it, this film grapples brilliantly with the moral nihilism that we all felt in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\n\n13. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nThis felt like Lee just wanted to say something about interracial relationships\u2014essentially that they would not work. But yo, this movie is riveting. The directorial flair, the acting, the music and the fact that \u201cjungle fever\u201d is now a part of the public lexicon places this firmly in the upper echelon of his filmography.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Inside Man (2006)\n\nDenzel Washington, Lee\u2019s frequent collaborator, is electric and makes the film work, but at this point in his career, this is a movie that I did not think Lee would make. A fun potboiler that shows us what is possible when Lee cuts back on his self-indulgent tendencies and focuses on a narrative.\n\n\n\n11. Bamboozled (2000)\n\nThis satire examines the vicious legacy of blackface in light of contemporary depictions of black Americans in popular media. It took me years to fully appreciate what Lee was up to, but now, looking back as a philosopher of race, I see that Lee\u2019s film is both prophetic about our contemporary moment and eternally relevant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)\n\nThis film turned D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and the late Bernie Mac into household names. Lee\u2019s swooping camera and clinical approach to the art of comedy centers the work that goes into the seeming effortlessness of the black expression of the art form.\n\n9. Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990)\n\nMy favorite of Lee\u2019s films uses the medium of jazz as a lens to meditate on the plight of black artists. Patriarchy and emotional abuse that are never fully critiqued keep Mo\u2019 Better Blues from being higher on the list, but the score and the performances of Joie Lee, Spike\u2019s sister, and Denzel elevate this otherwise small film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She\u2019s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nLee\u2019s first feature-length film is a French new-wave examination of the sexual double standards faced by black women filtered through Italian neorealism. His willingness to experiment with form, a major reason that his later films are not as successful, is how he made his name as a filmmaker. This film is now streaming on Netflix, and I am interested to see how the streaming service will update and expand upon the foundation Lee laid in its upcoming series.\n\n\n\n7. He Got Game (1998)\n\nLee knows basketball. A lifelong Knicks fan, he is known for his courtside antics cheering for a team that has not won a championship since Richard Nixon was in the White House. This film, both a love letter to the game and a searing indictment of the corruption that surrounds it, boasts a great Washington performance and a surprisingly competent one from Ray Allen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. 4 Little Girls (1996)\n\nHeartbreaking and raw, Lee\u2019s documentary about how the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., still haunts the family members of the four girls who died that day should have won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year. It let us know that Lee was not just a maker of fictional films and that he was a force to be reckoned with as a documentarian.\n\n\n\n5. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006)\n\nThis is Lee\u2019s magnum opus as a documentarian. It tells the story of Hurricane Katrina and shows how the U.S. government failed the people of the 9th Ward in every respect. It is required viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. School Daze (1988)\n\nBlack Greek organizations, magical realism, an HBCU football team that loses in embarrassing fashion during homecoming, Afrocentrism in tension with respectability politics, a song about colorism in the black community\u2014School Daze is everything.\n\n\n\n3. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nLee\u2019s most emotionally resonant film is an autobiographical story about a black family in the 1970s. For many it is their favorite, but the only reason it is not higher on my list is that the next two are so much more ambitious\u2014but depending on the day, this could easily find itself in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nMany consider this Lee\u2019s greatest film. It is a brilliant examination of black rage in the wake of the absurdity imposed by white supremacist police violence, a theme that still has resonance today. In fact, many were concerned that black folks would riot because of the climactic scenes. And yet this is a strikingly beautiful film. His frequent cinematographer Ernest Dickerson seizes every opportunity to use the lens to create striking images. This could be No. 1 if not for the sheer audacity of the film Lee made 25 years ago last week ...\n\n\n\n1. Malcolm X (1992)\n\nWhat can I add that has not already been written about this film? Washington should have won the Oscar. Lee should have won the Oscar. Angela Bassett should have won the Oscar. Whoever was the conk-hair consultant should have won an Oscar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee\u2019s depiction of the legendary historical figure was flawed because he used The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a foundation for the narrative, but that does not take away from the power of the film. He needed the help of Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent black folks to finish the film, and I\u2019m glad they came through financially. This is Lee\u2019s best film. The one he was born to make.\n\n\n\nHe is not a perfect filmmaker\u2014I\u2019m still lost for what I should think about Red Hook Summer\u2014but when he is on his game, he is among the best filmmakers in America.", "keywords": ["best", "lee", "ranked", "spike", "black", "x", "lees", "movies", "films", "work", "malcolm", "25", "won", "film"], "polarity": 0.1633188557005125, "subjectivity": 0.4983504414717432},

John Lewis (D-Ga.) and other Democrats went back to Congress to figure out what to do next on gun control. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that afternoon that he wasn\u2019t going to reward Democrats for their civil obedience.\n\nHonestly, when Lewis, the last survivor from the 1963 March on Washington\u2019s speakers platform, led that 26-hour sit-in on the House floor, I was intrigued and excited, but as the day went on, it did breeze through my mind that the old man was losing it. Why would this civil rights leader-turned-liberal lion use his hard-won movement cred for the one-gazillionth time in this semiorganized way?\n\nThis protest seemed as ad hoc as some sort of activist space cruiser left adrift without hyper drive. Ryan, part of a new generation of whites who've been exposed to the movement history that Lewis and others wrote in blood a half-century ago, understood that movements need open resistance to stay alive. So, although visibly annoyed, Ryan was smart enough to step out of the way: He turned off the House\u2019s lights and cameras, leaving the sit-in protesters to Periscope and Facebook. But Lewis got what he wanted: Buzzing commenced.\n\nIn retrospect, I was excited that someone had taken over the House, but I was disappointed by who. My almost quarter-century living in the Washington, D.C., area showed me, sadly, that the spirit of Che Guevara did not exactly thrive in the Congress\u2014or in corporate downtown white Washington, D.C., bougie black D.C., or now-gentrified white D.C., either. The party determined to elect Hillary Clinton this fall is in no way the hope of radical, or even substantial, social change.\n\nTearing through all three volumes of John Lewis\u2019 \u201cgraphic memoir,\u201d March (the third and final volume will be published next month), I saw that the Democratic Party really hadn\u2019t changed a bit. But I also got some clues as to the \u201cwhy\u201d of Lewis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis and his co-writer, Andrew Aydin, joined by artist Nate Powell, spill the bloodstained ink of a vicious history all over the more than 500 pages of the three volumes. Much of the 1955-1965 history is familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen a movement documentary or docudrama: the Freedom Rides, the Birmingham, Ala., church bombing, the Selma-to-Montgomery, Ala., march. It will come as no surprise to those who read these types of post-2010, black narrative-history books that Lewis\u2019 testimony is bookended, and fulfilled, by Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration.\n\nThe movement veteran does a great service by mentioning all of the people who were murdered on his watch who are not remembered by American history\u2019s ever-shrinking popular summary. The fact that a vibrant, courageous life can, and often did, end in a disturbing death haunts his work. Lewis and his colleagues in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee understood that they could be violently erased at any moment. They courted the Grim Reaper because they saw that risk as the only way to change the psychological and spiritual sickness of white supremacy and white indifference from the segregated outhouse to the segregated White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was most significant about March was its attempt not at visuals but at sound. The trio of creators want the reader to hear spitting sheriffs, marching heels, flashing camera bulbs and ringing phones. Although in black-and-white (symbolically?), the volume wants the young people of tomorrow\u2019s movements to experience both the sudden trauma and the little, quiet moments.\n\nMarch is mandatory reading for any teen or preteen, but I would strongly suggest that it be paired with Herb Boyd and Lance Tooks' contribution to the For Beginners documentary comic book series, Black Panthers for Beginners. Lewis\u2019 black Christian liberal worldview of black nationalism and Pan-Africanism, of Stokely Carmichael, of Malcolm X, needs to be supplemented and countered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Lewis is unquestionably an African-American hero. But as a Northerner who is a strong admirer of the black power movement, especially the 50-year-old Black Panthers, I feel he\u2019s also like black America\u2019s older, slightly annoying great-uncle who still thinks platform shoes and the O\u2019Jays are cool. Does Lewis, now 76, live waaaay too much in the interracial, supposedly harmonious past of pre-black-power-movement activism (a depiction as unreal as, well, movement comic books), or does he see a future in which black-led justice will be permanently linked with other struggles? Clearly both; from his perspective, he has no choice. And movement people believe in doing, in taking substantive risks\u2014and generating armchair criticism from those not in the arena, like me.\n\nSo the Last Speaker, the doer, moves, repping (and, frankly, perhaps sometimes taking full advantage of) his painful witness with his own very moral sense of struggle and justice. What was clear about the House sit-in was this: He tried to act against a brooding evil that had spilled innocent blood once too often. When put in those terms, election-year Democratic liberal stunt or not, Lewis had no choice but to fulfill his whole self, to try to bear witness before the latest shooting victims would be added to the historical limbo of the forgotten. Whatever you think of Lewis, Capitol Hill has seen motivations far less pure.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

Another executive explained that the tagline was \u2018too closely associated with Roger.\u2019 Fox executives have been instructed by management to market the network by its other tagline: \u2018Most Watched. Most Trusted.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance of what shedding \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 means for Fox News. (It would be like the New York Times giving up \u2018All the News That\u2019s Fit to Print.\u2019) Ailes invented the slogan when he launched the network in 1996, and over the years it became a quasi-religious doctrine among Fox\u2019s anchors and viewers. The effectiveness of Fox News as a vehicle for conservative ideology depended on it. \u2018If you come out and you try to do right-wing news, you\u2019re gonna die. You can\u2019t get away with it,\u2019 Ailes once told a reporter.\n\n\u201cInside Fox, Ailes held \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 seminars with staff members. . . .\u201d\n\nFewer people of color believe that Fox News is \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d Last year, the Gallup Organization asked, \u201cThinking about various sources of news available today, what would you say is your main source of news about current events in the U.S. and around the world?\u201d Eleven percent of non-Hispanic whites said Fox News, but only 5 percent of nonwhites did.

The way that the right-wing network covered the deaths of police officers in 2014 is a case in point.\n\n\u201c \u2018The politicization surrounding the killing of two New York Police Department officers over the weekend was amazingly swift. Fox News led the right-wing media charge, immediately claiming Democratic elected officials were somehow responsible for the gun rampage\u2026 ,\u2019 the MediaMatters analysis observed.\n\n\u201c \u2018On Fox, hosts and guests were sure who was to blame for the tragedy; not the gunman necessarily, but political and community leaders like President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, Mayor Bill de Blasio and MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton. Why? Because the men, to varying degrees, have spoken out about the troubled relationship between law enforcement and the black community, and raised concerns about two recent high-profile cases, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, in which unarmed black men were killed, and police officers responsible were not indicted.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSherman also wrote, \u201cIn the annals of modern advertising, \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 will be considered a classic.

More than 100 black people were gunned down during a mass shooting in Colfax, La., in 1873.\n\n\u201cSuggestions for future coverage include avoiding superlatives altogether, as comparing Sunday\u2019s tragedy to other incidents in history does it no justice.

After writing about the season finale of Insecure last week, I wanted to move on to other topics for discussion. But then, at last night\u2019s Emmys, Rae, in a moment of candor, found a way to make all her fans proud to be a part of the #IssaHive. When asked who she was rooting for, she responded, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing shocking about this statement to anybody who has grown up black and rooted for damn near anything in their life. It is a mantra for any of us who have watched any competition in which one of the competitors looks like us, sounds like us or is familiar to us.\n\nI remember as a kid watching shows like Family Feud, Double Dare and even American Gladiators, competitions in which there were absolutely zero stakes for me, and if there was a black competitor, I was rooting for them. Back then, I never thought deeply about this sort of fan appreciation. My rationale was simple: Black contestants, even on shows like the ones I mentioned, were rare, and therefore, rooting for them was done more out of a feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it then, I probably wasn\u2019t going to get another chance.\n\n\n\nBut in hindsight, I realized that part of my thinking was programmed by the way I would learn about black history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe way black history is taught to us in school is through the guise of firsts. From a very early age, most of the black people we learn about are put under a lens of exceptionalism. We learn about a black person who overcame a system of oppression and racism to become the first black person to accomplish everything from being the first African-American world heavyweight champion (Jack Johnson) to sitting at the front of a bus (Rosa Parks), and even those stories are sometimes distorted (shoutout to Claudette Colvin), but I digress.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of conditioning that lends itself to our cheering for our own out of solidarity. As Scoop Jackson once said, anytime you hear about a first black person winning or accomplishing anything of note, it is a reminder that racism exists. Issa Rae\u2019s statement last night exemplified that.\n\n\n\nAlready there are people who took Rae\u2019s words as racist, but in fact, her comment was rooting against racism. When Issa said she was rooting for everybody black, she was rooting for a new history to be made. She was rooting for Lena Waithe (Master of None) to be the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She was rooting for Donald Glover (Atlanta) to be the first black person to win for comedy-series directing. She was rooting for Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us) to be the first black actor since 1998 to win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for the same reasons I grew up rooting for Tiger Woods, Venus and Serena Williams, Barack Obama and any black contestant I saw on Jeopardy, Issa Rae was rooting for Donald Glover, Lena Waithe and Sterling K. Brown. There are so few of us in spaces like the Emmys that we rarely ever get the chance to root for us. So when we see us in those spaces, we may not know the full backstory, but we do know the history, and we\u2019re rooting for it to change.", "keywords": ["rooting", "history", "way", "im", "black", "raes", "win", "fubu", "issa", "person", "everybody", "racism", "learn", "rae"], "polarity": 0.09541889483065953, "subjectivity": 0.4461115355233002},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible. And so it was really world-building in its truest form.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.", "keywords": ["process", "lot", "wakanda", "complicated", "beachler", "world", "creating", "vibranium", "black", "coogler", "wanted", "cole", "panther", "exhilarating"], "polarity": 0.1521029814067789, "subjectivity": 0.44748481476329593},

Brown became the first black actor since 1998 to win the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Emmy, for his role as Randall Pearson on NBC\u2019s This Is Us.\n\n\n\nWaithe, whose autobiographical series The Chi was picked up by Showtime, won the award for her writing on Master of None\u2019s \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode, in which her character finally comes out to her family.\n\nDuring Waithe\u2019s acceptance speech, she spoke about LGBTQIA issues and urged viewers to \u201cgo out there and conquer the world. It would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nDecked out in an eggplant-colored tuxedo, Glover continued to make history as he took home the award for directing in a comedy series, for his \u201cB.A.N.\u201d episode of Atlanta, but he also won the comedy-lead-actor Emmy for his role on the series as well.

All for some misbegotten plan that he cooked up in his head to start a race war.\n\nRoof seems to have inhabited some dark corner of the world where hate-filled little men go to stew in their own vitriol and ass-backward beliefs about whatever specific groups they either distrust, flat out hate or blame for making their world such a horrible place. Whether I like it or not, it\u2019s their right to go online, to a bar, to a shack in the woods or any other place to do so, but unfortunately, every now and then, the Dylann Roofs of the world decide to put words into action, and now nine families, a church, a town, a state and a nation have had to deal with the fallout.\n\nAlmost a year before Roof\u2019s alleged actions at Mother Emanuel, another angry young man, Elliot Rodger, shot and stabbed his way through an area near the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six and injuring 14. Rodger left behind YouTube videos and manifestos to illustrate his motives in the most frightening ways possible. Unlike Roof\u2019s, Rodger\u2019s hatred was mostly focused on women and his lack of success with them. To wage this \u201cwar on women,\u201d little Elliot Rodgers went out and purchased a Glock 34 and a pair of Sig Sauer P226 pistols, then took out his rage on a group of innocent people. All before killing himself like a coward.\n\nThat brings us to Omar Mateen, whose deeds are fresh in our minds. In what seems be a strange mix of self-hatred, religion-based homophobia and extremist Islamic beliefs, Mateen killed 49 patrons of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. He started shooting people simply because they were either homosexual, allied with the LGBT community or just dancing before last call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe really messed-up part is that mass shootings will happen again. I don\u2019t know when or how soon, but something akin to this will occur at some point. The same questions will be asked. The same expressions of sorrow and concern will be made. The nation\u2019s leaders will opine on the state of things and what can be done to prevent this from happening again, and the public will forget about it all within a few months.\n\nOne of the few certainties about these incidents is that they have two frightening commonalities: an angry young man and guns. No matter where you are, a young man who feels wronged and possesses a gun is a recipe for disaster. The stamped metal of a Kalashnikov, the plastic polymer of an AR-15 and the 2 pounds\u2019 worth of steel that make up most handguns have forever made small, angry men feel big.\n\nSadly, in the United States, which fancies itself a \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation, these angry little men have utilized their Second Amendment rights to wage an assault on those who have drawn their ire. And the next mass shooting will be another reminder that, while we will never run out of angry young men, we have failed in preventing them from arming themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a gun owner, I find myself running through various scenarios on how to regulate an industry with constitutional protection and tons of money to lobby politicians to limit gun control. I\u2019m honestly fresh out of ideas on how to force the government and the gun industry into supporting stricter gun measures. What would it take to scare America into saying, \u201cOK, we need to seriously rethink the kind of guns we allow on the streets\u201d?\n\nLast November, actor Wendell Pierce tweeted, \u201cIf every Black male 18-35 applied for a conceal & carry permit, and then joined NRA in one day; there would be gun control laws in a second.\u201d\n\nSure, it sounds insane, but I bet it would work. Although I would never join the National Rifle Association, I wonder if gun regulations would change. I can\u2019t help pondering how those who are staunchly opposed to gun control would spin their new views given the NRA\u2019s history with the Black Panther Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not we pass stricter gun control, America has a serious problem, and on any given day, we could find ourselves trapped in a nightmare like the folks at Mother Emanuel, Pulse or UC Santa Barbara just because some angry little man got a gun and decided to make some twisted statement.\n\n\n\nKeith Young lives in Charleston, S.C.

In the promos leading up to the premiere of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News propagandist reveals five things we can look forward to on the show. We\u2019re supposed to forget that while at FOX News, she was smug, condescending, and, yes, racist throughout her stint there. The days in which she wanted it to be known that Santa is white and that\u2019s that.\n\n\n\nOK, Megyn Kelly, Santa Claus is still white, but are you also still fixated on a false, lily-white aesthetic for Jesus? Do you still think that black teenage girls tackled by police more or less have it coming? Is the New Black Panther Party still out to get white folks at a polling station near you? Do you still believe that former first lady Michelle Obama helps perpetuate a culture of victimization? Or, if it\u2019s easier, how do you feel about all the racist things you\u2019ve said over the years?\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to forget all of that, though. Instead, we should chuckle along about Santa Claus being white as we tune in to Megyn Kelly, serious journalist. Speaking of the Obamas, Kelly revealed in April 2016 that she would love the chance to interview them. She said:\n\nI would love to interview Barack Obama, and I\u2019d love to interview Michelle Obama. Have you ever seen her on Fox News? The Obamas are not big fans. I understand that. I still think they should do it. I think they would be able to reach a lot of people they don\u2019t normally reach, and I\u2019d be very fair.\n\nNot only should neither Obama ever bother to give her the time of day, but if the premier episode of Kelly\u2019s new show is any indication, it wouldn\u2019t be that enchanting an interview anyhow. Kelly did have what was referred to as \u201ca tough conversation\u201d with Vladimir Putin. (Insert low-level church applause for the soloist who everyone notices is flat here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was tough in that Putin is a murderous autocrat and noticeably made mention of Kelly\u2019s young daughter in a panel Kelly moderated prior to their sit-down interview. Yeah, it\u2019s tough in that Putin has no qualms about killing journalists like Kelly, but not so much in terms of Kelly\u2019s interview skills. Putin was Putin: arrogant, willfully dishonest, and more or less rubbing his dick on the forehead of the United States of America.\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with the likes of Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer, you are keenly aware of how challenging interviews with dictators can be, but also that they can nonetheless be quite rewarding. That was not the case here because Kelly does not have the range yet.\n\nKelly gets a lot of unwarranted credit for what happened during her infamous exchange with that real-estate-scamming megalomaniac at one of the Republican presidential-primary debates. Kelly did indeed draw a jarring reaction from him then and in the days after, but not so much because she asked some amazing question. No, he\u2019s just a brat who can\u2019t take any form of criticism\u2014especially not from a woman, since he is a sexist buffoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an actual interviewer, her flaws were on full display during her first prime-time special on Fox\u2019s broadcast network in May of last year. Kelly wasn\u2019t even as good as the delightful Robin Roberts in interviews with celebrities such as Laverne Cox. In that same special, she gave Donald Trump Saddle Tan Nixon a fluff interview. The end result of that special was that she exposed her weaknesses and tanked in the ratings.\n\nYet, here we are all the same. This isn\u2019t to say that Kelly won\u2019t get better. Likewise, no one is perfect on his or her very first show. Overall, the show is basically Dateline repackaged with Kelly as host giving you sprinkles of hard news and what is described as \u201cinspiration\u201d (say, when she talks to kids about politeness toward the end of her debut). Even so, it still all makes me recall Omarosa Manigault telling Bethenny Frankel on Frankel\u2019s now-canceled talk show that as a white woman, \u201cYou get to be mediocre.\u201d\n\n\n\nKelly isn\u2019t exceptional enough to warrant this show; nor has Kelly done anything to immediately warrant her ability to just push Tamron Hall and Al Roker out of their successful third hour of Today for whatever hers will become. What Kelly is, though, is a pretty blond white woman who exists in the era of a racist demagogue president. A lot of executives saw his victory and, in turn, also wanted to \u201cmake America white again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus far, that\u2019s going about as well as anyone not as clueless would expect: Her debut finished third in total viewers behind ABC\u2019s NBA Finals pregame special and a rerun of 60 Minutes on CBS.\n\nWhether or not Kelly improves is beside the point. This is a woman who has benefited from whiteness for much of her professional life. She\u2019s unapologetic about her racist past because it has given way to her undeserving present. At the very least, she should have the audacity to be exceptional, but I suppose that would be too much like right, so the snore NBC presented last night is the one it deserves.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "interview", "kellys", "kelly", "racist", "special", "putin", "come", "woman", "obama", "happens", "megyn", "whiteness", "night", "mediocrity"], "polarity": 0.13325720256754736, "subjectivity": 0.4511118574911681},

We spoke with Jackson around the launch of his 21-lesson course for aspiring actors, and while there wasn\u2019t enough time to ask about every single one of his famous film roles\u2014could there ever be?\u2014here are a few of his most iconic (and his most viral).\n\nComing To America (1988)\u2014\u201cHold-Up Man\u201d\n\nAVC: How long were you on the set for this one, since you have a pretty small part?\n\n\n\nSamuel L. Jackson: I think it was really one day to do that scene. It was a very interesting dynamic doing that. I mean, the biggest star on the planet at the time was Eddie Murphy, and you\u2019re just supposed to show up and do your job. [Director] John Landis said he was kind of surprised that New York actors come to auditions and they sit around and talk to each other. You\u2019re sitting there, staring at a script and saying lines in the air and kind of hanging out with each other. Everybody knew what they had to do, and they did it.\n\nSo when I got on set, I was ready to go. It didn\u2019t matter if Eddie Murphy [was there], didn\u2019t matter if Arsenio [Hall, was there], I was like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re actors, let\u2019s go.\u201d And I had a great time doing it, and I got paid. It\u2019s kind of easy to get a job on a previous role, and just come in like, \u201cOkay, rob the place.\u201d But you have to inform the place with some kind of energy, and some kind of motivation, so you figure out why you\u2019re doing it. Why are you robbing this place? What desperate situation caused you to go into a place in broad daylight with a shotgun and rob somebody? Find a great motivation, and get in there, and do it. And use that energy to, hopefully, fire up the other people in the scene, and it\u2019ll be infectious. And the scene will have that kind of energy and that kind of dynamism, and people will remember it.\n\nAVC: What was the motivation you came up with for your character?\n\nSLJ: I was desperate\u2014not to buy drugs or anything, but [I had] a person at home, a girlfriend who\u2019s telling you, \u201cYou\u2019re out the bills and food. You need this, you need that. And you either get it, or don\u2019t come back.\u201d That was me.\n\nAVC: Have you ever seen the videos on YouTube that are, like, \u201cSamuel L. Jackson\u2019s greatest swearing moments?\u201d This one\u2019s always in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I know that there is a YouTube thing of every \u201cmotherfucker\u201d Samuel L. Jackson has ever said in a movie.\n\n\n\nAVC: Yeah, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nSLJ: It needs to be updated now. There\u2019s, like, two years of \u201cmotherfuckers\u201d they\u2019re missing. I mean, The Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard alone, probably as long as that [whole] clip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVC: Have you ever seen the TV edit of any of your roles that have a lot of profanity in them? Like the TV edit of Jackie Brown or this scene in Coming To America?\n\n\n\nSLJ: I\u2019ve only seen parts of them. I remember going into the studio and doing the TV versions. I remember doing the TV version of Pulp Fiction. You\u2019re in that studio saying things, and they\u2019re correcting you, and they\u2019re all, \u201cIf you could say it on the correct note\u2026\u201d You end up making up a lot of stupid shit like \u201cmonkey-fighters\u201d and \u201cmotor scooter.\u201d\n\nAVC: It was \u201cmelon-farming motor-scooter\u201d in Jackie Brown, as I recall.\n\n\n\nSLJ: Right. Melon-farmer. Melon-farmer, Maryland farmer, my frien-duh. That always works.\n\n\n\nDo The Right Thing (1989)\u2014\u201cMister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy\u201d\n\nAVC: Do the Right Thing was actually shot in Brooklyn\u2014was it in the summertime? Was it really that hot?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Blazing hot. Spike\u2019s movies, at that time, were always done in the summer. We always referred to it as \u201cSpike Lee\u2019s Summer Film Camp.\u201d The people would get together, and we\u2019d say, \u201cTime to go to Spike\u2019s Film Camp! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\n\n\nThat particular block was kind of blown out. There were a lot of crack dealers in that block. So, Spike\u2019s bodyguard force went in there and cleaned out the neighborhood. So, as far as we could tell, they were still hanging around and threatening them. \u201cY\u2019all was gonna be interfering with business.\u201d I was kind of like, \u201cYou do know that I just act for a living. I\u2019m still a regular motherfucker, I\u2019ll whip your ass.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey finally got over that, but, yeah it was hot. I was in that damn radio station. I was essentially covered at the radio station, because I was inside. When it rained, they would come in the radio station, and then it\u2019d stop raining and they\u2019d go back outdoors. But I was always in that radio station, either asleep or eating or staring at everybody out that window wondering if they were doing something. Because I had to be in the window, because they shot the window all the time, at the radio station. I always had to be sitting in that window looking out.\n\n\n\nAVC: What do you do when you have down time on set?\n\n\n\nSLJ: I read. I like books. I\u2019ve always got a literature book going. I\u2019d be in there reading, in my off time.\n\n\n\nJungle Fever (1991)\u2014\u201cGator Purify\u201d\n\nAVC: After that, you had a bigger role in Jungle Fever, and you took that part right after dealing with your own issues with drugs. Was it an emotional experience for you? Playing that role after going through it and coming out the other side?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: It was a pretty good part. I was two weeks out of rehab, still detoxing. Spike wrote it, you know, a certain way, but I started talking to him about what it meant to be a part of a family. That it was more about the abuse of my relationships with all of the people around me that drove that addiction. So, generally when you saw Gator, he wasn\u2019t high. He was trying to get out, in need.\n\nSo it was all about the manipulation of family members, or people he was close to, and pretending you\u2019re sorry about something you\u2019d already done, so you could get what you needed. Consequently, Gator became this iconic character that most people got, that because during that time\u2014this was in the midst of another opioid epidemic\u2014everybody had a family member. You had a brother, an aunt, a husband, an uncle, cousin, somebody who came by your house and stole your shit, or broke your heart in some kind of way. I thought that was more important than just being a junkie.\n\nI was Gator, and Chris Rock played Pookie (in New Jack City), and those showed two very different dynamics of what crackheads were. Mine was more about the family relationships. So when people sat there and got that, they can sit there and say, \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s my friend.\u201d Or \u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d Or cousin or somebody. They empathize, or they had something that they could latch onto, in that particular movie, of my story, and go with it.\n\nGoodfellas (1990)\u2014\u201cStacks Edwards\u201d\n\nAVC: What was that drink you\u2019re pouring in the bar scene in Goodfellas? The one you say is \u201cbetter than sex?\u201d Because it looks like cr\u00e8me de menthe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I\u2019m going to say it was ice tea\u2014and something else, I\u2019m sure, in the tea. I suggested that particular description. I\u2019m pretty sure it was iced tea. Although we were at a bar, and one guy did drink it. You know, you walk in, and Marty and everybody are there, and we had a good time, we really did. I don\u2019t even remember having a trailer on that particular film. They used to put me in peoples\u2019 houses, in the neighborhood over there by John Gotti\u2019s front. [Jackson is referring to the Ravenite Social Club, a well-known Mafia hangout in New York\u2019s Little Italy Gotti operated in the late \u201980s. \u2014Ed.] I remember having dinner with gangsters at peoples\u2019 houses in the neighborhood.\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\u2014\u201cArnold\u201d\n\nAVC: That\u2019s another one where you spend a lot of the movie up in the control room, sort of like the radio station in Do The Right Thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I was actually supposed to go to Hawaii, to shoot my death scene. But there was a hurricane that destroyed all the sets. So I didn\u2019t get to go to Hawaii.\n\nAVC: Oh no!\n\nSLJ: All you see is the residue of my body, my arm. But yeah, I was supposed to be on set [and do a death scene].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, you know, I enjoyed being on that set, with Jeff [Goldblum] and Sir Richard Attenborough. It\u2019s funny, because Steven [Spielberg] would actually operate the camera sometimes. He\u2019d consider the camera, and he\u2019d be kind of looking at me, and he\u2019d go, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to get you,\u201d and everybody just has to start scrambling, and we\u2019d shoot. He actually shot a few of the things that I\u2019m in, in that lab, with that long ash dangling off that cigarette. Hogging that fake cigarette. Because I had quit smoking, and he wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t go back, so he got me the worst-tasting fake cigarettes ever.\n\nAVC: This is something I\u2019ve always wondered\u2014when you\u2019re typing on a fake computer in a movie, are you just hitting random keys, or is there much purpose to it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Oh, we hit random keys. I mean, that\u2019s just how we do it. Nobody\u2019s ever asked me to bring up the right program.\n\n\n\nPulp Fiction (1994)\u2014\u201cJules Winnfield\u201d\n\nAVC: And then we have a role that I\u2019m sure you get asked about and stopped on the street for constantly, which is Jules in Pulp Fiction. Is it true Tarantino wrote the part for you, after you were in True Romance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happened. [Laughs.] I auditioned for Reservoir Dogs, and I auditioned for Quentin and Lawrence Bender, and they were pretty new at the time, so I didn\u2019t know who they were. I pretty much fucked up my audition.\n\nAnd then I went to Sundance, and I was there when they had the first screening of Reservoir Dogs, and after the movie I went up to Quentin to tell him how much I liked the movie, and he was like, \u201cOh, man, I remember you. I didn\u2019t like the guy who got your part!\u201d [Laughs.] And I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d He would\u2019ve had a better movie with me in it. The guy he hired was a soap opera actor. He was fine, but I would have been better. And he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m writing this thing right now, and I\u2019m writing a part for you.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d And then a couple weeks later, I was in Virginia doing a movie, and Pulp Fiction showed up.\n\nJackie Brown (1997)\u2014\u201cOrdell Robbie\u201d; The Great White Hype (1996)\u2014\u201cRev. Fred Sultan\u201d\n\nAVC: So, in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s movies, you always have interesting hair styles. In Pulp Fiction, you have the Jheri curl, and in Jackie Brown you have that long braided goatee, and then the white hair in Django Unchained. What\u2019s up with that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I mean, hair is very, very distinctive. I remember when Sir Laurence Olivier died. I was sitting at home watching TV, and there was a retrospective. They put his face up onscreen, and people were talking about him and how he just walked into all these different characters that he played. And I\u2019m sitting there watching, going, \u201cWow, I remember that movie,\u201d you know. And a lot of things you remember about\u2014well, the first thing you remember about most characters is what they look like. I\u2019m coming from the theater, where you change all the time, so when I got into movies, I figured, \u201cWell, shit, they\u2019ve got better makeup artists.\u201d I did my own makeup when I was in the theater, and they\u2019ve got makeup artists and people who do shit [on film sets], so one of the things that always struck me was to find a distinctive hairstyle for each character.\n\nI started that with that boxing movie I did, I can\u2019t think of the name of it\u2026 Oh, The Great White Hype. The director wanted me to look like Don King, and everybody knew who Don King was. But I didn\u2019t want to be Don King. I wanted the man to be Rev. Fred Sultan, so I decided to make him look like Julius Caesar. So I had a white, silvery Julius Caesar haircut underneath the turbans and all that. And from that point on, I just decided, I had this great wig-maker, so I just found hairstyles that I felt would be distinctive for every character. Like an adventure.\n\nAnd I think, \u201cI\u2019ll do the same thing with Jackie Brown.\u201d Quentin was talking about Ordell a little bit, and I was like, \u201cI\u2019m sure Ordell is one of those people who thought Superfly was the greatest movie ever made.\u201d So he cuts his hair and straightens it, but he never has enough money to maintain it perfectly. So it\u2019s kind of nappy around the edges, straight and kind of puffed up. That\u2019s why he\u2019d always keep it in a ponytail or a braid. The chin braid was an homage to me and Quentin\u2019s love of Hong Kong movies. Chinese gangsters always have interesting facial hair, and I had seen this guy in China who had, like, a mole on his neck, and a two-foot braid coming out of that mole. The hair growing out of this mole was in a two-foot braid that hung over his shirt collar. And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s dope!\u201d So, I decided to put it on my chin, and I was pretty happy with that. We were just having fun and creating a distinctive character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVC: The Hong Kong villains have interesting eyebrows, too. They always have big, puffy eyebrows.\n\nSLJ: Yeah. I did a little bit of that in Jackie Brown, but not a lot.\n\n\n\nDie Hard With A Vengeance (1995)\u2014\u201cZeus Carver\u201d\n\nAVC: You worked with Bruce Willis a lot after Pulp Fiction, like in Die Hard With A Vengeance. What was that set like? They were getting deep into the franchise at that point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I remember watching the first one, and my friend Reggie VelJohnson played that fat black cop that\u2019s outside talking to him anytime he\u2019s in the building [Sgt. Al Powell \u2014Ed.], and I\u2019m sitting there going, \u201cHow the fuck did you get this job?\u201d I\u2019m going, \u201cI love that movie. Damn, I wish I could be in a Die Hard movie.\u201d\n\nAnd I was in New York shooting Kiss Of Death, and I had an audition for Waterworld, and I was waiting on the call to see if I got that job. And then one day I walked up, and these people came to me and said, \u201cLaurence Fishburne is doing Waterworld, and I know you auditioned for it, but he was supposed to be in Die Hard With A Vengeance. Do you want to be in Die Hard?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck yeah! Yes! I\u2019ll take that job!\u201d And my agents cursed me out and said, \u201cYou never take a job without talking to us.\u201d I was like, \u201cFuck.\u201d But that\u2019s pretty much how that happened. Fish got Waterworld, I got Die Hard, because he wouldn\u2019t do it, which is fine. I was in a place where, every script that I touched, if they came from Hollywood, were Denzel scripts, or it was a Forest Whitaker independent job. Those were the two black guys that they looked at first, and I was joining them. Finally I said, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it. Let\u2019s see if I will.\u201d And that\u2019s how I ended up in Die Hard. It turned out to be great! [Dennis Hopper ended up taking over Fishburne\u2019s part in Waterworld, further sweetening the deal for Jackson. \u2014Ed.]\n\nIt was a great time, because we had an interesting script. The first script was called Simon Says, and something was going on, because some days we\u2019d get to work, but we wouldn\u2019t actually have dialogue. We would go to Bruce\u2019s trailer, and they\u2019d say, \u201cOkay, you have to go from 168th Street to 97th Street today. We\u2019re going to do it in the cab, and Sam, you say this. Bruce, what do you want to say?\u201d And that\u2019s how Bruce\u2019s \u201chey, Zeus!\u201d thing came up. That was stuff that we made up in the trailer. So, we got all the way down to 72nd Street when we finally got a script, with the whole thing on the phone: \u201cI met a man going to St. Ives, he had seven wives, each wife had seven cats,\u201d yada yada, that whole thing. So it was kind of fun, making it up as we went along.\n\nAVC: So was it just you and Bruce in the cab? How did the whole crew get around, moving through the city like that?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Cameras on flatbed trucks. There are times where Bruce is actually driving, like we actually did that drive through Central Park with me in the car. The meadow and all of it. I thought it was great, because I\u2019d always wanted to do that when I was sitting in traffic, get on the grass and all that. I had a chance to drive the wrong way on Eighth Avenue, which was awesome. All kinds of good stuff was happening on that movie. It was good. Interestingly enough, with the subway getting blown up\u2014people are worried about terrorists doing that shit, but we did it. We did that in Charleston [South Carolina]. We built the whole set in Charleston, and we did the bridge jump there, too.\n\nDeep Blue Sea (1999)\u2014\u201cRussell Franklin\u201d\n\nAVC: I have a question about your death scene, where the shark comes out of the water and grabs you. Did you ADR the scream that you hear when your digital body is getting thrown around, or is that a Wilhelm scream?\n\nSLJ: Yeah, it\u2019s me.\n\n\n\nAVC: How did you shoot that scene?\n\nSLJ: I was just kind of standing there in front of the thing, and then I\u2019m doing my speech. They had a big, I guess, rubber shark, that they hung up on an arm, and they CGI-ed the rest of it, grabbing me and pulling me in. But we had a couple of big mechanical sharks that actually worked on that set. Sometimes they did go crazy, goddamn banging their heads on the wall, but they had real mechanical sharks out there. That was great. When Renny [Harlin] called me, he said that he wanted me to do this movie, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to be the first person to die.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh?\u201d He said, \u201cIf we kill you, then that means anybody in the movie can die,\u201d so I said, \u201cOh, okay. Great.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVC: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but there are also quite a few Samuel L. Jackson death montages on YouTube. That\u2019s also a thing.\n\nSLJ: I did not know that. I\u2019ll have to find those. I often think, \u201cHow many ways have I died in the movies?\u201d I guess I can find out now. I\u2019m always thinking of ways that I haven\u2019t died. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been killed this way in this movie, but I haven\u2019t died this way yet.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been guillotined, or anything like that.\n\nAVC: If you search it on YouTube, there\u2019s three or four of them that come up. One is ranked.\n\nSLJ: Awesome.\n\nShaft (2000)\u2014\u201cJohn Shaft\u201d\n\nAVC: You were in the Shaft sequel that came out in 2000, and there\u2019s another one that\u2019s coming up again soon. Were you a fan of the original Shaft?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Well, of course I was! But when I was approached to do it, I pretty much insisted that they put Richard [Roundtree] in the movie, so that they would know that I\u2019m not trying to imitate that guy. That guy still exists. And this guy, he\u2019s an iteration of that guy, but he\u2019s not that guy. So that helps a lot. I didn\u2019t have to use the traits that Richard used, the \u201cbump-a-chick-a-bee, the guy on the street, sex machine for all the chicks,\u201d all that shit. I was free to create my own thing.\n\nThe even more interesting dynamic about that is, when we started shooting the film, Christian Bale\u2019s character was the bad guy, for real. I was chasing him the whole movie. And Jeffrey Wright\u2019s character, Peoples, was awful, as Jeffrey played it. So we had to kind of fix this, the good guy\u2019s the dangerous guy. The rich kid\u2019s not dangerous. We fixed that, and then it worked a lot better.\n\nAVC: I read\u2014I think in Variety\u2014that you\u2019re involved in a new one that they\u2019re making. And it\u2019s becoming a generational saga, is that right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Yeah. The son I have is one that my wife took away from me because my life was too dangerous, and she didn\u2019t want him in that environment. And now he\u2019s a young FBI agent, his friend gets killed, and he comes to me for help. So, there\u2019s a whole dynamic of this young millennial who has no street skills, but his name is Shaft. He\u2019s trying to be this kind of person that he\u2019s not. In the midst of helping him solve his crime, I\u2019m also trying to help him become a bonafide Shaft.\n\nAVC: Cool.\n\nSLJ: Raises the cool factor, yes.\n\nAVC: I saw the 2000 Shaft in the theater, and I remember thinking all the coats you wore in that movie were so cool.\n\nSLJ: Oh, yeah. He had a good wardrobe.\n\nStar Wars: Episode I\u2014The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II\u2014Attack Of The Clones (2000), Star Wars: Episode III\u2014Revenge Of The Sith (2005), \u201cMace Windu\u201d\n\nAVC: Another big franchise you\u2019ve been part of is, of course, Star Wars. What\u2019s it like acting in front of a green screen, especially in scenes where your scene partner isn\u2019t really in front of you, like when you\u2019re talking to Yoda?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: I had the luxury, actually, in Episode I\u2014when I got there, the first thing I did was with Yoda. And fortunately, at that time, Frank Oz was still doing Yoda as a real puppet. So there was a person operating his right hand, a person doing his left hand, somebody else operated his eyes, and Frank did the voice. I had the real puppet at first, so I knew what his size was and all of that. So when it got into CGI on the next film, I had a good gauge on where he was and how he moved, and I followed that. So that was the easy part.\n\nAVC: Also, why a purple lightsaber?\n\nSLJ: George told me, he said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s a green screen. The more you do, the more we have to go on. So can you make yourself look like a badass, or you can screw it up.\u201d So, having fought a lot of imaginary things as a child, in my room, I went back to that space. Now, I didn\u2019t get to get my lightsaber out that [first] day at all. There was a big arena fight scene in that film, too, and a whole bunch of Jedi, and a whole bunch of bots. And I\u2019m looking at this rendition of the scene and going, \u201cShit, how am I going to find myself in this?\u201d So, in my mind, I said, \u201cIf I have a different color lightsaber, then I\u2019ll always know where I am.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I said [to George Lucas], \u201cI\u2019d like a purple lightsaber.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhy?\u201d and I said, \u201cI just want to be able to find myself. I\u2019m the most powerful Jedi in the universe, and I think it would be an interesting thing for me to have a different color lightsaber than anybody else.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d So we shot, and when he called me back for re-shoots, he said, \u201cYou know what? I tried something, and it\u2019s already causing a shitstorm online, so I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to keep it. But I\u2019ll show it to you.\u201d He showed me a clip, turning on my lightsaber, and it\u2019s purple! He\u2019s going, \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2014give it back, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to keep that.\u201d But when the movie came out, he kept it.\n\nAVC: So when you\u2019re on the set, filming a lightsaber battle, are you just holding the handle and pretending, or is there something there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: No, you actually have a full saber. It\u2019s green, for the green screen, and the saber itself is a little plastic rod that they color in and make the blade. I had to do, I think it was, 97 moves in three days, and I was fighting backwards. So. You\u2019ve got a month to learn that fight. You start off with your saber, and you show up with your sneakers on, and real slowly, you learn the moves so you can see that you can do it. And you\u2019ve got it, you\u2019ve got the fight down pat.\n\nAnd then, they show up with your boots, and you\u2019re like, \u201cRight, this is very different from my sneakers.\u201d So you have to re-learn the fight with your boots on. And after you learn that, they show up again with the long-ass robes with your long-ass sleeves on it, and your boots. I went, \u201cOh, shit. I\u2019ve got to learn the fight again.\u201d Then you learn how to figure out how to keep your sleeves out of the way of your lightsaber. It\u2019s a process.\n\nUnbreakable (2000)\u2014Elijah Price\n\nAVC: So we\u2019ve discussed Bruce Willis, and we\u2019ve discussed the color purple, which brings us to Unbreakable. You just shot the sequel to that recently, right?\n\nSLJ: Glass, yes.\n\nAVC: Did you expect there to ever be a sequel to this movie?\n\nSLJ: Originally, when we shot the first one, it was supposed to be a trilogy anyway. I\u2019m not sure why that didn\u2019t happen, coming off of the success of The Sixth Sense and \u201cI see dead people.\u201d [Laughs.] I guess, in some ways, [Unbreakable] is seen as a failure because it didn\u2019t make as much money as The Sixth Sense. And [M.] Night [Shyamalan] kind of got away from it, I guess. And then he figured out a way to do it. He says he had the idea to do it all along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when he did Split, that was the perfect way in. He kind of did, once again, the opposite of Elijah, and the same as Bruce\u2019s character. The Beast is as unbreakable as David Dunn. And it\u2019s kind of tempting to put those characters together with me in the middle as the manipulator, the same that I was in Unbreakable, and see them as different kinds of superheroes, one the good guy and one the bad guy. In the comic book mold, the Elijah mold.\n\nAVC: If I may say so, your performance in Unbreakable is one of my favorite parts of the movie.\n\nSLJ: I like that one, too. Even better now.\n\nAVC: It\u2019s one that\u2019s kind of come back in the popular consciousness, I think. Maybe as people who saw it as teenagers have grown up.\n\nSnakes On A Plane (2006)\u2014\u201cNeville Flynn\u201d\n\nAVC: All right, Snakes On A Plane. I only have one question. Did the catchphrase, \u201cI have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!\u201d come before the movie? That seems like it was designed for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Interestingly enough, we didn\u2019t shoot that the whole time we shot the movie. Because [the producers] wanted a PG rating for the movie, so they would never let me say it. And then all of a sudden I just tested it, and the next thing I know we were doing re-shoots, and that was the only thing we re-shot, me saying, you know, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!\u201d I\u2019d told them before, \u201cYou might want to shoot it so you\u2019ll have it,\u201d but they wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nAVC: I didn\u2019t realize that, since you have so many famous catchphrases. It seems like that would be the selling point of the film.\n\nSLJ: No, it\u2019s often hope, hopeful movie making. You\u2019re always looking for that. That\u2019s always funny, when you\u2019re looking for that future line. \u201cUh oh, future line. Okay.\u201d\n\nIron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015), Captain Marvel (2019)\u2014\u201cNick Fury\u201d\n\nAVC: I wanted to ask you about playing Nick Fury in all the Marvel movies. You gave your license to use your image as Nick Fury in the comic books. How does that feel?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSLJ: Yeah. The first time I saw Nick Fury was in the comic books, at Golden Apple [Comics]. Mark Millar. Mark Millar, genius. Yeah.

But we\u2019re going back now, and I meet Captain Marvel in more of an origin story. You\u2019ll see Nick Fury with another guy\u2019s face, somebody that\u2019s got two eyes, so that\u2019s a whole big deal. You\u2019ll see.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

This weekend will see the release of Black Panther: The Album, curated and produced by Kendrick Lamar. This was a collaboration dreamed up years in advance, but only became what it was after Lamar got a sneak preview of history in the making.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler detailed how he and Lamar came together to collaborate on the film\u2019s soundtrack. Coogler said he\u2019d been a fan of Lamar since his first mixtapes, and had touched base with him a few years ago about working together on some kind of project. The opportunity came around April 2017: Lamar had just released his latest album, DAMN, and Coogler saw an opening to get him involved in making some music for Black Panther, which Marvel supported. In order to make the offer too good to pass up, Coogler came prepared with some of the footage.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt first, he was just going to do a few songs for the film,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cThen he came in and watched quite a bit of the movie, and the next thing I know, they were booking a studio and they were going at it.\u201d\n\nLamar and Top Dawg Entertainment producer Sounwave started developing the album in the summer, with much of the work happening during the DAMN tour, which lasted from July to early September. In fact, Sounwave said about half of \u201cthe production, the hooks, and ideas\u201d were created while they were on tour. Sounwave\u2014who\u2019s a comic book fan himself\u2014added how much he admires that Marvel gave them creative control over the album\u2019s sound, feel, and voice.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only right,\u201d Sounwave says. \u201cThe movie\u2019s not set in 1910, or the 1960s when Black Panther first came out \u2014 it\u2019s set in today. There\u2019s \u2018today\u2019 moments happening in the movie, so we want the whole soundtrack to sound like that too.

Some are calling it genius and whichever other superlative they can think of. Others have been somewhat underwhelmed.\n\nLast week, we started an email thread for the VSB contributors (some of whom have seen it, some of whom haven't, and some of whom eventually saw it while this discussion was taking place) to share their thoughts on it. (BTW, there are some minor spoilers)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of my biffles saw it and hated it, but he hates a lot of things. He was disappointed in the interracial subplots and ranted to me about it for, like, an hour.\n\n\u2014-Danielle Belton\n\nI find that Black folks who have limited interactions with White folks are among the most frustrated by them. Which is interesting. To me. But. That wasn't what you asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust based on what I know of the movie\u2026and what I see on Twitter\u2026 it's an observation.\n\n\u2014-Maya Francis\n\nMaya, I would have guessed it was the opposite. At least from my experience. The people who seem to complain the most about Whites are the ones who interact with them on a daily basis. Me? I work for EBONY and VSB, so I don't need to interact with Whites unless I go to Panera. Basically, I love White people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon Young\n\nYes and no. I think more interaction yields more complaint (that's with anything, right?) but in my experience, I find folks who are most rigid in their views of White folks have limited exposure.\n\n-\u2014Maya\n\nI haven't seen it but plan to . My expectations have already been made by reviews. I want to be entertained, I want to like it, and I gather I will like it. Will I think it's important? I doubt it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy whole thing is, as much as a movie like this deserves to be made, I don't see how it has to be this deep, impactful thing. I remember going to a screening of Black-Ish and Tracee Ellis-Ross was there to do a post-screening Q&A. One of the things she said about the sitcom (and I'm paraphrasing here) was that she wanted people to remember, the whole point of Black-ish is to be funny, not save the race.\n\nI think people forget that whole medicine-in-the-candy thing. Things can just be good, clean fun. That in itself is a step in the right direction, and that is all I want Dear White People to be.\n\n\u2014-Jozen Cummings\n\nJozen, it's interesting that you say that, because the less than positive reviews (haven't heard or seen any straight negative ones) I've heard/read all basically said that the problem with the movie isn't that it's not \"important\" or that it doesn't save the race. It's that it's not funny\u2026or even fun. (And yes, I'm aware those were two of the most awkwardly constructed sentences ever created)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nI think what you mentioned is very important. When I go to the movies, my ULTIMATE desire is to be entertained. That's it. I have loved some of the most terrible movies ever (You Got Served is my shit) b/c of the entertainment value. So when I say I wasn't even whelmed, it wasn't because of what this movie was supposed to mean in terms of depth and impact. Noap. I walked out and I wasn't even sure how entertained I was. I want to like movies b/c they made me laugh, feel, or something. Something that I walk away and I'm like\u2026yeah, that joint right there???\n\nI know quite a few folks who have seen it already. Multiple times for some people and what I noticed was that nobody who has seen it was talking about it. The only thing folks have said - opinionated folks, mind you - was that it was good. Nothing more. That struck me as odd and interesting. I'm like you Jozen, I just wanted Dear White People to be fun and entertaining\u2026as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, I can't wait to hear the opinions.\n\n\u2014-Panama Jackson\n\nI got all ready to see it and then remembered that I live in 1998 and it's not playing here. Will have to get to DC or something. I'm curious to see if the leading character is as obnoxious as I suspect she is. The clips alone feel heavy handed. But, you can never be too direct when battling their Fuckshit. Need to get my hands on a screener.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Alex Hardy\n\nI really think the \"save the race\" thing was placed upon them more so than their intention. I mean, they really couldn't escape that because funny/entertaining or not, the very existence of a movie entitled Dear White People that is so open/candid in a time where race relations are relating like a motherfucker, it is bigger than just a movie.\n\nThat said, I think messages are best conveyed in a funny/lighthearted/sarcastic manner. At least, they seem to be better received that way, from the mass audience. I don't even expect it to be deep or heavy-handed. In fact, I would've been disappointed if it was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoint is, It's possible to be entertaining and learn something. Edutainment for the motherfucking wins.\n\n\u2014-Tonja Stidhum\n\n\n\nthe very existence of a movie entitled \"dear white people\" that is so open/candid in a time where race relations are relating like a motherfucker, it is bigger than just a movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is exactly why I want to see it. The boldness of the title. period. Because we live in a society that says talking about race is racist, and race baiting is the real problem here. And I love the idea that this movie plays (potentially) into the so-called problem of race in america.\n\nI don't even think I have expectations for the it. I actually don't know much about it at all, except the title. and until about 30 seconds ago when I googled it, I didn't even know that it was supposed to have an actual plot and actual recognizable actors. And yes, even after months of hearing about it, I haven't once bothered to look up any info. I've just been ready to pay my money to the box office simply because Dear White People is catchy as hell. and I live in Portland, OR - the WHITEST city in America - so I feel obligated to support such a movie title.\n\n\u2014-Gem Jones\n\n***At this point, the weekend passed, and many who hadn't yet seen it were able to***\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to say that overall I enjoyed it but definitely felt the \"pressure\" to be that movie that it was expected to be. I could tell Justin wanted to get as many racial points as he could within this near two hour film because it might be his \u2014 or anyone else's \u2014 last chance to do it for a while. The circle of strife. I realllllly hope this isn't reality, but from what we've been shown so far, there are only a certain number of slots open for movies for us, by us.. But, shit\u2026that's the problem. That's impossible. We can't portray the \"universal\" Black experience in one movie. Shit, in ten movies. THAT'S why we need many more movies. A lot of Black folk \"types\" we wish to see can be told through a series of stories that White people don't have to worry about seeing. They see it all the time. Because, as we know, in the movie industry White is everyman. They're the default. Blech.\n\nBut, at the same time, I thought it did a good job by also being a movie that wasn't JUST about the racial aspect. It was really about belonging/identity to me. Which is a universal theme. I thought it did a good job of providing that balance.\n\nI really enjoyed the cast the most and actually look forward to seeing them more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Tonja\n\nJust saw it a few hours ago and I really liked it. I thought I was going to have a hard time enjoying it away from the shadow of the things I'd read already, but you fall into the story pretty quickly.\n\nAs far as critiques, the only opinion I've heard that was true for me was that it was shot INCREDIBLY fucking well, but the writing lacked at times. There *were* a lot of subplots, but I didn't think it was anything overwhelming, and everything got a proper resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for whether or not it \"accomplished\" anything, I think it did an amazing job of being illustrative of real life scenarios, similar to what I love about Black-ish. I liked that even with the Black characters that you're not supposed to like there was still a sense of pride that didn't allow for certain comments to be made from the White antagonist characters (i.e. Coco and Mitch's first scene).\n\nFor me, DWP is an effective, if subtle, contribution to the conversation about racial inequality and self-identification that's been simmering recently. Sam's comments about anarchists being the proverbial mirror holders was well-placed as the story started to come together. I want to see it again but on this first watch I took a lot away from it despite the occasional forced language.\n\n\u2014-Ryan Sides\n\nI couldn't agree more, Ryan.\n\nTunde and I saw it tonight and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI would love to see more movies like this made - movies highlighting the diversity in \"Blackness\" and the greyness of \"the\" Black experience. We colored folk are very multidimensional and I thought that was captured quite nicely in the film. The movie was far more about the Black people in the film than the White people and I love the title even more as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Gem\n\nI had an epiphany a few months ago: I enjoy juices and other beverages with raspberry added to them (raspberry iced tea, raspberry pink lemonade, raspberry Bellini, etc) so why not just make some raspberry juice? I already had a juicer and all types of blenders, so all I need to do was buy a bunch raspberrys, blend them up with some water and a little sugar, and voi-fucking-la!\n\nSo I did it, and it was\u2026ok. Not the nastiest juice I've ever tasted, but I'll never do it again. The idea of the juice was better than the juice itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, in a contrived nutshell, is how I felt about Dear White People. I'm very glad so many people were able to enjoy it. This bodes well for the careers of all those involved with the film, as well as other Black creatives attempting to get their work financed. These are undeniably great things.\n\nI just wish I enjoyed it too.\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nI went to see it this weekend and enjoyed it very much. I thought it was shot/filmed well, and I though it was well written. I have some small gripes with how heavy handed some of the messaging got. It was A LOT of dialogue, but something about that was endearing. It all felt very millennial, like a School Daze for people who didn't go to an HBCU. It's almost as if the director convinced himself if he could only make one film, this was the one he wanted it to be, and that's why it had so much stuff, but by the end, I told myself, I hope this isn't the last film we see from him. He has talent, as do some of the actors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nYeah, I can definitely see the School Daze for an PWI thing here. Maybe for millennials it'll have the same type of resonance that School Daze/A Different World had/has for those in Gen X.\n\nBut what did you actually like about it? This isn't just addressed to you Jozen but to all others who enjoyed it. Most of the positive comments I've seen/read about it have been more abstract, dealing with how it's \"great to see Black people on film\" and how the \"issues it addresses\" and \"discussions it'll prompt\" are worthy of praise. But what about the actual movie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon\n\nI liked the story structure. This is essentially an ensemble cast playing in a coming-of-age film. I think that's a tricky thing to pull off with one character, let alone four. So I thought they did that well, but didn't make it completely Hollywood so to speak. Not everyone becomes friends, they still have to be individuals and even after this crazy scandal that's rocked their school, you're not convinced they learned something new. The only one gets that cliche Hollywood ending is Sam with her White boo, but that romance was so underdeveloped so I kind of took it as her realizing something about herself rather than the guy she was supposed to be with. Like she just needs to let more love in and be with someone who can let her be vulnerable.\n\n\u2014-Jozen\n\nTo me, though, part of a good film IS that it prompts discussions. I think that is valid component of a good film. That it can live on PAST the actual screening. I know the primary focus is to entertain, but for me, those things can co-exist. A movie to me is far more than simply entertaining, it's a potpourri of things. That's art.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Jozen, I thought it was shot really well and that part alone makes me want to see more work from Justin. The composition of certain shots really encapsulated his style and the choices he made with these shots really inspired me.\n\nAs for the content of the movie, I think the overall theme of finding your own identity is what I liked about it. Even within the confines of our own race, we struggle to belong. Further, I liked how the characters were contradictory. There wasn't anyone who was JUST this or JUST that, they all had internal struggles that gave them some depth. Now, I think because this was ensemble film and those are hard to do (especially in a film that has a difficult social message such as race, and a film that DOESN'T wanna be 4 score and 7 years long), some of the relationships between the characters lacked some depth. It definitely wasn't a perfect film, nor did I expect it to be. But, for what it was\u2026 I liked it.\n\n\u2014-Tonja\n\nI echo a lot of sentiments already written. I loved the way the film was shot and the story development. One thing I took away from the movie is I'm damn sure I attended HBCUs for both of my degrees. The idea that I have to join the BSU just because I'm Black is absurd to me. Also, the notion that being Black is the first identifier is crazy. Yes, I'm Black but don't lump me in. What if I like chess, or comic books, or anything else? I can't be the athlete, or the nerd or the goth dude?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movie gave me more Higher Learning than School Daze. The one part of the movie I didn't care for the love story with Sam and her TA. I seemed a little too contrived in my opinion. For some reason the apex of the movie during the race riot and a lot of the private meeting of the leadership of the BSU reminded me of scenes from Gil Scott Heron's Nigger Factory.\n\nOverall I thought it was a great movie and I'm glad I could support.\n\n\u2014-Tunde Akinyeke\n\nJust wanted to come back and agree with some of y'all that this makes me want to see more from the creator and some of the actors. I didn't know the star from Everybody Hates Chris was going to be in it so that was a pleasant surprise. Also, I really like Coco and Troy, together and individually, and I'm interested in what else Sam may have to offer (sorry I don't know the actors' names).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as my takeaway from the film, I want to talk about it with everyone! I want to see it again and I want to dissect not necessarily the film itself, but the different scenarios in the film and how other people have handled them in real life. I'm finding that Sam's character and the realization of the importance of anarchists has really resonated with me. I'm working through my own newly-ignited passions in the wake of Trayvon and Mike Brown, so for that concept to have been articulated the way it was has put me in this mood of exploration and trying to carve out my contribution to the change in social climate.\n\nPlainly put, I've just been pensive as shit since seeing the movie.\n\n\u2014-Ryan\n\nTo summarize, everyone here who's seen it liked it. A lot, actually. Except Panama and I, and neither of us liked it at all. There was exactly one scene I thought was laugh out loud funny \u2014 Sam's silent film project about Obama \u2014 but nothing else prompted much of a reaction from me. No smiles, no anger, no cringing, nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt could very well be coincidence that we happen to be the ones who didn't enjoy the movie, but I think there might be something else here. Aside from Danielle (who, from my knowledge, still hasn't seen the movie yet) we're the oldest people in this thread. We're both 35. No one else is above 32, and a couple of you are under 30. Basically, you're all Millennials, but we're technically a part of Generation X.\n\nI wonder if our lack of like stems from this just not being a movie for us. We didn't need a Dear White People the same way people five or ten years younger than us might have. I understand why it was necessary. And again, I'm glad it was made and seems to be doing well. But it just wasn't necessary to me (and presumably Panama), and perhaps this lack of connection to it allowed us to be more critical of it.\n\nOr maybe we're just two old-ass haters. Which would mean Charles Barkley was right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014-Damon", "keywords": ["white", "dear", "movie", "roundtable", "thought", "im", "black", "really", "race", "think", "thats", "film"], "polarity": 0.14987675020292218, "subjectivity": 0.4843579432720057},

He has nestled in his full-length no fucks futon; his bare feet stretched on his no fucks ottoman, reading perhaps How to Give No Fucks and Influence People or Chicken Soup for the Fuck-less Soul.\n\nThis is the president we anticipated when all that hoping and changing was happening in 2007 and 2008. But, for very practical reasons \u2014 namely, the country wasn't quite ready for a Black president, much less a fuck deficient Black president \u2014 we didn't start to really see him until he was reelected. Which, again, makes perfect sense. You just don't go all DeMarcus Cousins at your new job before your first performance review. But he's here now, and it is glorious.\n\nAnd, to clarify, \"giving no fucks\" does not mean that President Obama \u2014 or anyone else who gives no fucks \u2014 is without a care or concern. It just means that you no longer care about and you're no longer concerned with meeting the unreachable expectations of people who don't actually want you to reach them. In Obama's case, these people are usually called \"conservatives.\" For laymen such as you and I, these people are usually called \"haters.\" President Obama does, in fact, seem to care about many things. ISIS. The economy. The Wire. Sasha's sartorial choices. Selfies with Michelle.\n\nAnd while tears aren't always a reliable measure of ones actual feelings about a subject, I have no doubt that the ones he shed at today's press conference, where he introduced new gun control measures, were real. Violence is not a uniquely American problem. For a developed country, however, gun violence is uniquely American, and its something we all have at least a tangential connection to. If you happen to be a Black American, this tangential connection becomes sturdier. I have been personally affected by gun violence. I've had friends killed, cousins incarcerated, and a home shot into. And I imagine most reading this can say similar things. No one \u2014 not even a millionaire family with two Ivy League-grad parents and two private school-attending teenage daughters \u2014 is immune, and I'm certain our president is aware of this. And I'm also certain he's aware, as many of us are, that the primary factor morphing perfunctory human agitation and conflict to the type of murder and mayhem we see today is the availability of guns.\n\nIf these measures \u2014 which, like all other gun control measures he's proposed, are so remarkably mundane and common-sensible that the pushback bleeds into absurdity \u2014 work, perhaps Congress will be shamed into following suit.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

Over the past few years, the City of the Big Shoulders has been the go-to dog whistle for Republicans and what-about-black-on-black-crime enthusiasts alike. The city\u2019s spot on America\u2019s Wheel of Sensationalism has dominated the larger national media gaze as the premier symbol of the black community\u2019s perceived moral decay, with no sign of letting up.\n\nConsequently, Hollywood depictions of the city, looking to cash in on its problematic visibility, have run the gamut from cringeworthy to insulting. Few examples are more emblematic of this shameless leeching than Spike Lee\u2019s Chi-raq, in which Chicago is used as a mere prop and vehicle for Lee to display his increasingly conservative and uninspiring politics while revealing a gaping disconnect with the city\u2019s culture and citizens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo obviously, upon hearing that Chicago native, actress and screenwriter Lena Waithe would be handling new Showtime series The Chi\u2014which premiered Sunday\u2014I sighed with a bit of relief. Waithe, who grew up on 79th Street before moving to Evanston, Ill., as a preteen, expressed in several interviews that she wants to show a more \u201chumanized\u201d view of the people who inhabit the neighborhoods of her childhood with less focus on the \u201csenseless violence\u201d and more centering of the everyday people who are trying to survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Let\u2019s show black people in Chicago in a positive light,\u2019\u201d Lena Waithe told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI want to show people in a human light.\u201d She\u2019s joined by another Chicago native, rapper and actor Common, who is executive producer. The cast consists of an impressive roster that includes Jason Mitchell (Mudbound, Straight Outta Compton) Alex R. Hibbert (Moonlight) and Sonja Sohn (The Wire), and the show boasts an all-black writers\u2019 room, which Waithe calls \u201cunheard of.\u201d\n\nWith all of these promising aspects in mind, I was still admittedly a bit apprehensive about the series, afraid I\u2019d be hypercritical about inaccurate and inauthentic details and trauma-porn-like violence to give it a fair shake. Having moved to Chicago\u2019s South Side on 83rd and Seeley with my family at 8 years old after fleeing Los Angeles shortly after the riots, I spent most of my childhood, adolescence and adult life toggling between Los Angeles and Cook County, Ill., living everywhere from up north\u2019s Edgewater to out south\u2019s 64th and Drexel, so I was curious to see if I\u2019d recognize the city that I hold dear being reflected on the screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pilot episode, which is available on YouTube, both confirmed and quelled some of my reservations. The opening scene follows a character named Coogie\u2014a teenage boy with a head full of billowing curly 3c hair\u2014as he rides his bike past murals and vacant housing along a sparsely populated 79th Street while music from Chance the Rapper serves as the score.\n\nEven with all the South Side landmarks (and after guffawing at a scene where you can see Sears Tower on 79th), Coogie\u2019s appearance is glaringly unfamiliar. Dressed in yellow Vans, pink socks and shin-hugging athletic joggers with a floral backpack, Coogie does not look like a boy from 79th.\n\nAs he haggles with Habib the corner-store owner for a discount on some grape pop and jerky, he doesn\u2019t talk like a boy from 79th, and wearing noise-canceling headphones while out in the streets, where awareness and survival are inextricably linked, he does not act like a boy from 79th, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese may seem like minute, insignificant details for people unfamiliar with the city; however, this is the first indication of what appears to be a recurring theme with The Chi: It\u2019s a show that ultimately seeks to explain the black people of Chicago to non-Chicagoans, and these details are treated as inconsequential to that objective.\n\n\n\nThe Chi is packaged as a coming-of-age drama (the young character Kevin, portrayed by Moonlight\u2019s Alex Hibbert, is who you see on the promotional poster). However, there is no singular protagonist. There are other characters central to the story\u2014Brandon (Jason Mitchell), Emmett (Jacob Latimore) and Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine)\u2014whose lives begin to intersect because of a graphic shooting that claims the life of a teenage boy.\n\nThe show skillfully displays the ripple effects of gun violence in Chicago and the choices it presents to those who are connected to both perpetrators and victims living in a city with a notorious and well-earned distrust of law enforcement\u2014although it is a bit jarring that gun violence is ultimately the catalyst that propels the plot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s more of an ensemble story (similar to that of The Wire) that grabs from the lives of various characters found in Chicago\u2019s poor and working-class communities. The web the show weaves to connect these characters does at times seem a bit unlikely; however, it\u2019s never completely unbelievable or melodramatic.\n\nThere are more fumbles in the details. The South Side middle school students and characters look more like extras from Dope than people actually from \u201cthe crib.\u201d The navy-and-white school uniforms, skinny jeans, painstakingly exposed designer belts, flashy shoes, Louis Speedy bags, sew-ins, false lashes and coveted designer outerwear that you\u2019d more commonly see in real life are replaced by colorful and eclectic styling and natural dos that would be more at home on Grown-ish. The Kedzie Pink Line train pulling into the Garfield Green Line station during a scene with Coogie and Brandon is bound to make a local scratch their head in confusion.\n\nThe slang is outdated\u2014there\u2019s one scene where Kevin literally says, \u201cGet to steppin\u2019,\u201d and to be honest, I don\u2019t even know anyone under 60 who calls Chicago \u201cthe Chi.\u201d Emmett is a slacker and a sneakerhead who makes money from shoe resales, as opposed to something more common to a Chicago hustle, like a card cracker or the more legal option of cutting hair. And quite frankly, the score could use a bit more local flavor beyond that of Chance (King Louie, Valee, Dreezy, Noname, Lil Durk, maybe some BJ the Chicago Kid).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show partially compensates for these oversights with some commanding performances, like Jason Mitchell\u2019s Brandon\u2014a young cook trying to climb the ladder in Chicago\u2019s thriving restaurant scene that you can\u2019t help wanting to see win. Scenes with Kevin and his friends are particularly fun and charming to watch, and the moments that do feature speaking parts from locals are refreshing and hopefully will become more frequent.\n\nUnfortunately, the female characters are so staunchly confined to narrow tropes (the angry baby mama, the grieving black mother, the angry black mother, the doting girlfriend) that they didn\u2019t have a chance to make an impression. Hopefully they\u2019ll be afforded the complexities of their male counterparts in later episodes.\n\n\n\nWaithe says that she wants to hear critique and feedback from Chicagoans the most, and that is encouraging. Ultimately the cast, crew and creators of The Chi seem genuinely interested in establishing a connection with the local culture (the bad blood established with the West Side\u2019s North Lawndale community during filming notwithstanding) and doing the city of Chicago and its people justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, like most shows and films that center the city, it presents the South Side (which is expansive and a lot more economically diverse than the West Side) as both the sum total of Chicago\u2019s black communities and a monolithic blob of poverty and violence. The West, East and North Side communities just do not exist in Waithe\u2019s Chicago.\n\nIt may not be realistic to expect The Chi to tackle all the nuances the city has to offer, but as a show that touts wanting to comprehensively represent the city, it would be nice to see the several little worlds that make up Chicago and their differences occasionally acknowledged as the series moves forward.\n\nEssentially, I think The Chi has a lot of promising factors. These tweaks are possible, and I do look forward to keeping up with the show. Again, Waithe emphasizes wanting to \u201chumanize\u201d the people of Chicago to the world, and while that\u2019s an admirable objective, one hopes the show\u2019s direction focuses less on convincing the world that the black communities of Chicago are, in fact, filled with humans and a bit more on showing a Chicago that the people of the city itself can see themselves in.", "keywords": ["79th", "wrong", "black", "characters", "chicago", "gets", "right", "bit", "city", "violence", "waithe", "scene", "chi"], "polarity": 0.07594242424242424, "subjectivity": 0.4573333333333332},

He was named for the iconic black activist Malcolm X. And yet when Malcolm wanted to put the moniker of his namesake (and thus a shortened form of his own name) on his senior sweater, school officials deemed it inappropriate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Mychelle Combs, Malcolm\u2019s mother, told the New York Daily News following another disappointing meeting with Christ the King High School President Michael Michel.\n\nMalcolm\u2019s parents were once again unable to secure the right for their son to put Malcolm X\u2019s name, his name, on the back of the sweater.\n\n\u201cThey are supposed to teach the students tolerance and to embrace other cultures,\u201d Mychelle Combs added.\n\nShe told the Daily News that when she asked Michel and other white officials at her son\u2019s high school \u201cif they even knew who Malcolm X was or what he stood for,\u201d they just stared at her and sat without saying anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Rev. Kevin McCall, crisis director at the National Action Network, told the Daily News that school administrators actually had a ranking of different black leaders, and guess who was deemed inappropriate?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr.? Totally fine.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and Malcolm X? No way.\n\n\u201cI asked if my name was Alfred Sharpton and I wanted to use Al Sharpton on my shirt, can I do that?\u201d McCall recounted. \u201cAnd [Michel] said, \u2018No. We stand by that.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Daily News notes, the nature of this school\u2019s hang-up about Malcolm X\u2019s name is unclear. There are several schools across the nation named after the black activist. The U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in his honor in 1999.\n\nSchool spokesperson Bill Cunningham said that Malcolm (the student) got approval to use either his last name, first name or simply \u201cMalcolm Xavier\u201d on the $40 school sweater, confirming that the school vets all names proposed by students and ruled against Malcolm X.\n\nBut it was not only the rejection that left the family baffled\u2014it was also how it was done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe assistant principal pulled him out of English class and told him, \u2018You don\u2019t wanna be associated with his name,\u2019\u201d McCall told WABC-TV. \u201cHe was like, associate with MY name? That\u2019s my name. That\u2019s on my birth certificate.\u201d\n\nMcCall said after that, another teacher came in and pointed at Malcolm, laughing at him and saying, \u201cThis is the new Malcolm X.\u201d\n\nThe school denied that the assistant principal made derogatory comments about Malcolm X. But the family disagrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey simply don\u2019t like Malcolm X; that\u2019s basically their view,\u201d Mychelle Combs said. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not surprised they feel like that.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, many white people see Malcolm X as a controversial figure, given his unapologetic defense of and insistence on black rights, black freedom and black equality \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\n\nMalcolm X\u2019s daughter Ilyasah Shabazz reached out to the school, offering to visit for a 30-minute assembly to help educate students and staff about the black leader and to teach them about \u201cthe historic social climate through which this young, compassionate and brilliant Malcolm navigated to have an egalitarian future for all Americans (as well as any oppressed persons abroad),\u201d she pointed out in an email to the Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Cunningham brushed off the offer, saying that the school has taught lessons on Malcolm X before.\n\n\u201cThis school has been teaching about Malcolm X for 20 years as part of African-American history,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cMalcolm X is part of the curriculum here, so there\u2019s no attempt in any way to shun Malcolm X and his contributions to America.\u201d\n\n\n\nRight.\n\nSo now the National Action Network, along with Ilyasah Shabazz and the Combs family, have decided to gather at the National Action Network on Malcolm X Boulevard to discuss the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are not accepting no,\u201d McCall said. \u201cFor them not to be culturally sensitive is a slap in our history\u2019s face.\u201d", "keywords": ["wants", "student", "namesake", "told", "school", "daily", "xs", "thinks", "x", "black", "combs", "sweater", "mccall", "thats", "malcolm", "nyc", "senior"], "polarity": 0.05904525777253051, "subjectivity": 0.3599964580873672},

And then I Googled \u201cWakanda ticket prices,\u201d as if the country were real.\n\n\n\nThe short review is: Black Panther is a thing of cinematic black excellence, and the world just has to deal. It\u2019s everything you want it to be and more. I\u2019m still hype, and I screened this movie Jan. 30 and kept my mouth shut about details all this time! I think I deserve an award.\n\nI am going to try my best to wrap up my bubbling emotions (yes, still bubbling) into a cute little package for you all, just to tell you what you already know: Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther is powerful enough to shift the planet. It\u2019s like Coogler grabbed everything black people talk about in barbershops, church, kitchens, cookouts and group texts and wrapped it in Wakanda magic.\n\nImagine living in a northeastern country in Africa and having the entire world see you as a developing nation, but you\u2019re literally sitting on a gold (vibranium) mine. If you\u2019re triggered, it\u2019s because, throughout this mystifying film, Coogler reminds you of how close the themes are to what\u2019s happening or has happened in the world around us. The entire continent of Africa is often perceived as developing, when, in reality, it\u2019s a rich land of kings and queens.\n\nWakanda (much like another fan favorite with a nod to the Motherland, Coming to America\u2019s Zamunda) shows off its royalty through elaborate and blatant displays. Black Panther has a strong focus on legacy\u2014who gets to be a part of it, how far a king would go to protect his country\u2014but it also explores how the entire world changes because of an unexpected shakeup of political power (cough\u2014Donald Trump\u2014cough).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe that delivers a superhero story with heart, soul and rhythm. Black Panther confronts the conflict of being a wealthy nation refusing to disturb itself by helping the rest of the ailing world.\n\nYou can see immediately that the \u201cgood guy,\u201d T\u2019Challa, operates in a gray area. His choices are political and often clouded by his drive to protect his people. And even though the film is named for his superhero namesake and T\u2019Challa is one of the most complicated of heroes, Chadwick Boseman plays it in a way that makes room for his star-studded ensemble cast to shine bright.\n\n\n\nAnd no one shines like T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright). Wright is what Tiffany Haddish was to Girls Trip. Her hilarious one-liners from \u201cwhatter thooooosssee\u201d to \u201ccolonizer\u201d will have you wishing she was in every scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright\u2019s Shuri works in the tech lab in the Wakanda kingdom. She\u2019s in charge of all things Black Panther. She rebels against the poised nature found in royal bloodlines and wins you over with her espressolike spunk, quick wit and mind-shattering tech talents. Shuri is a beacon for little black girls who may have been called nerds as if that were a bad thing. Watching Shuri bounce around her lab, decorated in funky paintings, walls vibrating with music, is like sharing dreams in color of all the young black girls who code.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther delivers a message of power in many forms to young black girls. Every female character in this film has an arc that makes her live long after the credits roll. Okoye (Danai Gurira) is a stunning character, but Gurira\u2019s portrayal of her makes me want to be a soldier\u2014not for America, of course\u2014for Wakanda. The Dora Milaje is a group of female soldiers devoted to T\u2019Challa\u2019s protection; they believe in their country over everything.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil it for you, but the fight scenes in which the Dora Milaje are featured will have you signing up for all kinds of self-defense courses. But it\u2019s Okoye and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) who are the Beyonc\u00e9s of combat. As the leader of the Dora Milaje and a war dog, respectively, these women showcase a quiet inner and outer strength you\u2019d want the entire movie wrapped around. And it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are the stars here. From Okoye snatching off her own wig to Nakia using her heel as a weapon, there\u2019s no denying this ode to black women.\n\n\u201cStand up. You are a king,\u201d Ramonda (Angela Bassett) shouts at son T\u2019Challa during a battle for the throne. \u201cShow them who you are.\u201d\n\nThese may have been encouraging words for T\u2019Challa to dig in and fight harder, but they sank in for me. Black Panther was a full-on love letter to the Motherland, but there were also several smaller love notes to blackness throughout. Whether they were the cheers from Ramonda, or Nakia\u2019s Bantu knots, or the Wakanda dignitaries with lip plates, or Wakandans speaking isiXhosa, a South African language known for its tongue clicks, there was more than enough evidence of the appreciation and adoration for all things black in this film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Black Panther\u2019s villain, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is someone to be proud of. Coogler uses him as a means to explore identity, legacy and Diasporic blackness.\n\nJordan\u2019s Killmonger just might be the best villain I\u2019ve seen since Heath Ledger\u2019s the Joker. You immediately think Marvel villain Ulysses Klaue is going to be who T\u2019Challa is up against, but Killmonger shuts that down quickly.\n\nKillmonger is undoubtedly scary and will end your life without a first, second or third thought, but his heart is actually in the right place. He wants to fight for the black people who are left in America\u2019s poverty and need just a taste of the riches Wakanda offers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s the scariest villain because Killmonger actually believes in what he\u2019s doing, and, honestly, so will you. He\u2019s an advocate for black people outside of Wakanda. But we all know, black or white, Wakanda doesn\u2019t do outsiders. Without saying too much, sometimes it be your own people.\n\nKillmonger doesn\u2019t want to take Wakanda down. He wants everyone to have a piece of the kingdom\u2019s glory and is determined to make it happen by any means necessary\u2014even if that means taking down T\u2019Challa.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Michael B. Jordan is one of Ryan Coogler\u2019s go-to stars. His range and depth are awe-inspiring. At one point, Killmonger shifts your entire morality by saying, \u201cBury me where my ancestors jumped from ships because death was better than bondage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoogler\u2019s genius can be seen and felt the entire time you\u2019re sitting there, thrown smack-dab into Wakanda. I get antsy after about an hour and a half during movies, but Black Panther held my attention far longer.\n\nLet\u2019s all do what we can to make sure Ryan Coogler stays protected because we need his genius. We need his storytelling and his ability to make T\u2019Challa and all of Wakanda jump off the comic book page with so much seasoning, I don\u2019t think we even deserve it.\n\nThis movie is the epitome of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d Black Panther is an entire body raised in goosebumps. It\u2019s a ride I wasn\u2019t ready for, but would gladly ride over and over again. I already know I\u2019m going to see this movie at least three more times. It\u2019s the same reason Black Panther\u2019s presale tickets have already outpaced those of any other superhero movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s about time we get to see our people in a movie like this. And this is only the beginning. We should all experience Black Panther.\n\n", "keywords": ["shuri", "biggest", "wakanda", "movie", "delivers", "blackest", "world", "superhero", "black", "good", "panther", "tchalla", "villain", "killmonger", "entire"], "polarity": 0.0943629029372831, "subjectivity": 0.4756165551620095},

It was a fight she often waged with a quiet and graceful dignity, while simultaneously raising a family constantly under threat. And while she may not be considered the \u201cMother of the Freedom Movement\u201d\u2014a title typically assigned to Rosa Parks\u2014Coretta was undoubtedly one of its primary muses, a living, breathing symbol of the steadfastness of the American black woman in defense of her family and the freedom of her race.\n\nThe King Center notes:\n\nCoretta Scott King was one of the most influential women leaders in our world. Prepared by her family, education, and personality for a life committed to social justice and peace, she entered the world stage in 1955 as wife of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant in the American Civil Rights Movement. Her remarkable partnership with Dr. King resulted not only in four children, who became dedicated to carrying forward their parent\u2019s work, but also in a life devoted to the highest values of human dignity in service to social change. Mrs. King traveled throughout the world speaking out on behalf of racial and economic justice, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, gay and lesbian dignity, religious freedom, the needs of the poor and homeless, full-employment, health care, educational opportunities, nuclear disarmament and environmental justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar before her time, Coretta Scott King also embodied the rare work-life balance so many of us are still seeking, gracefully managing to mother her four children with Martin while consistently supporting, speaking and creating for the movement\u2014including organizing the series of Freedom Concerts that functioned as vital fundraisers for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. And she did it all in inimitable style.\n\n\u201cI feel like the women are superheroes, too. And so, Coretta Scott King is a superhero.

What\u2019s more, his TV show, She\u2019s Gotta Have It, inspired by his first feature-length film, will debut on Netflix later this week. With all those things bringing his career to mind, I decided to research Lee\u2019s filmography, and two things hit me immediately.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne, dude is mad prolific. Throughout the \u201990s, he virtually made a quality movie every year.\n\n\n\nTwo, his filmography is rather uneven. He has made movies that run the gamut from brilliant (School Daze, Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X) to damn, nigga, really? (Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, Red Hook Summer).\n\n\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of Malcolm X, his most ambitious film, I will offer a ranking of Spike\u2019s 25 best films.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n25. She Hate Me (2004)\n\nThis is not a bad film\u2014just a messy one. It is unfocused and tries to do too much narratively. When it came out, many were confused. They thought they just did not understand what he was up to. Time has revealed that it was not that we did not understand but, rather, to quote Hov, \u201c\u2019Cause you don\u2019t understand him, it don\u2019t mean that he nice.\u201d\n\n24. Oldboy (2013)\n\nThis is a technically proficient film\u2014it is just unneeded. The original is close to perfect. This is just there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23. Miracle at St. Anna (2008)\n\nThis is an ambitious film, but it is overly long. I started watching it when Barack Obama was elected, and when I finished, Donald Trump was in office.\n\n\n\n22. Chi-raq (2015)\n\nLee\u2019s attempt to wrestle with the violence in Chicago is stylish but deeply flawed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n21. Passing Strange (2008)\n\nMore known for his fictional films, Lee is also an accomplished documentarian. This is a recording of \u201cthe best play to never win a Tony,\u201d written by Stew.\n\n\n\n20. Jim Brown: All-American (2002)\n\nJim Brown is a fascinatingly complicated black man, and Lee\u2019s documentary lays that all bare.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth (2013)\n\nThis film surprised me. Mike Tyson is a tragically flawed yet magnetically charismatic man\u2014Lee films him empathetically.\n\n18. Summer of Sam (1999)\n\nThis tells the story of the 1977 serial murders that took place in New York City. It builds suspense competently, but I have no idea what Lee was trying to say with the film. His visuals are jarring, yet what good are the chills if the story leaves so much to be desired?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Get on the Bus (1996)\n\nThis story about black men on a bus to the Million Man March flirts dangerously with emotional manipulation, but the performances of Ossie Davis, Charles S. Dutton, Bernie Mac, Andre Braugher and others save the film from sentimentality.\n\n\n\n16. Clockers (1995)\n\nAn examination of the interconnectedness of those who investigate crimes and those who commit them, Lee\u2019s Clockers is a precursor to The Wire in form and style.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. If God Is Willing and de Creek Don\u2019t Rise (2010)\n\nThis sequel to Lee\u2019s brilliant When the Levees Broke is haunting. It showed us just how much work remained to be done after Hurricane Katrina while examining the impact of the BP oil spill of 2010. His ability to construct a vibrant narrative using the documentary format is on full display in this HBO film.\n\nThe remaining films are what made Spike Lee Spike Lee. The following are all legitimately great films worthy of deep examination and deconstruction. My ranking of his top 14 films changes almost yearly, but I am willing to go to blows with anyone who denies their brilliance\u2014even while I am willing to admit that they are not all flawless in their execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. 25th Hour (2002)\n\nA rarity for Lee in that almost exclusively white actors populate it, this film grapples brilliantly with the moral nihilism that we all felt in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\n\n13. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nThis felt like Lee just wanted to say something about interracial relationships\u2014essentially that they would not work. But yo, this movie is riveting. The directorial flair, the acting, the music and the fact that \u201cjungle fever\u201d is now a part of the public lexicon places this firmly in the upper echelon of his filmography.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Inside Man (2006)\n\nDenzel Washington, Lee\u2019s frequent collaborator, is electric and makes the film work, but at this point in his career, this is a movie that I did not think Lee would make. A fun potboiler that shows us what is possible when Lee cuts back on his self-indulgent tendencies and focuses on a narrative.\n\n\n\n11. Bamboozled (2000)\n\nThis satire examines the vicious legacy of blackface in light of contemporary depictions of black Americans in popular media. It took me years to fully appreciate what Lee was up to, but now, looking back as a philosopher of race, I see that Lee\u2019s film is both prophetic about our contemporary moment and eternally relevant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)\n\nThis film turned D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and the late Bernie Mac into household names. Lee\u2019s swooping camera and clinical approach to the art of comedy centers the work that goes into the seeming effortlessness of the black expression of the art form.\n\n9. Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990)\n\nMy favorite of Lee\u2019s films uses the medium of jazz as a lens to meditate on the plight of black artists. Patriarchy and emotional abuse that are never fully critiqued keep Mo\u2019 Better Blues from being higher on the list, but the score and the performances of Joie Lee, Spike\u2019s sister, and Denzel elevate this otherwise small film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She\u2019s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nLee\u2019s first feature-length film is a French new-wave examination of the sexual double standards faced by black women filtered through Italian neorealism. His willingness to experiment with form, a major reason that his later films are not as successful, is how he made his name as a filmmaker. This film is now streaming on Netflix, and I am interested to see how the streaming service will update and expand upon the foundation Lee laid in its upcoming series.\n\n\n\n7. He Got Game (1998)\n\nLee knows basketball. A lifelong Knicks fan, he is known for his courtside antics cheering for a team that has not won a championship since Richard Nixon was in the White House. This film, both a love letter to the game and a searing indictment of the corruption that surrounds it, boasts a great Washington performance and a surprisingly competent one from Ray Allen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. 4 Little Girls (1996)\n\nHeartbreaking and raw, Lee\u2019s documentary about how the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., still haunts the family members of the four girls who died that day should have won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year. It let us know that Lee was not just a maker of fictional films and that he was a force to be reckoned with as a documentarian.\n\n\n\n5. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006)\n\nThis is Lee\u2019s magnum opus as a documentarian. It tells the story of Hurricane Katrina and shows how the U.S. government failed the people of the 9th Ward in every respect. It is required viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. School Daze (1988)\n\nBlack Greek organizations, magical realism, an HBCU football team that loses in embarrassing fashion during homecoming, Afrocentrism in tension with respectability politics, a song about colorism in the black community\u2014School Daze is everything.\n\n\n\n3. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nLee\u2019s most emotionally resonant film is an autobiographical story about a black family in the 1970s. For many it is their favorite, but the only reason it is not higher on my list is that the next two are so much more ambitious\u2014but depending on the day, this could easily find itself in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nMany consider this Lee\u2019s greatest film. It is a brilliant examination of black rage in the wake of the absurdity imposed by white supremacist police violence, a theme that still has resonance today. In fact, many were concerned that black folks would riot because of the climactic scenes. And yet this is a strikingly beautiful film. His frequent cinematographer Ernest Dickerson seizes every opportunity to use the lens to create striking images. This could be No. 1 if not for the sheer audacity of the film Lee made 25 years ago last week ...\n\n\n\n1. Malcolm X (1992)\n\nWhat can I add that has not already been written about this film? Washington should have won the Oscar. Lee should have won the Oscar. Angela Bassett should have won the Oscar. Whoever was the conk-hair consultant should have won an Oscar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee\u2019s depiction of the legendary historical figure was flawed because he used The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a foundation for the narrative, but that does not take away from the power of the film. He needed the help of Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent black folks to finish the film, and I\u2019m glad they came through financially. This is Lee\u2019s best film. The one he was born to make.\n\n\n\nHe is not a perfect filmmaker\u2014I\u2019m still lost for what I should think about Red Hook Summer\u2014but when he is on his game, he is among the best filmmakers in America.", "keywords": ["best", "lee", "ranked", "spike", "black", "x", "lees", "movies", "films", "work", "malcolm", "25", "won", "film"], "polarity": 0.1633188557005125, "subjectivity": 0.4983504414717432},

It is a billion-dollar business.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe, like Oprah, called the names of activist and organizer Fannie Lou Hamer; of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men; of Rosa Parks; of activist Tarana Burke\u2014saying their work, their sacrifice, cost them something.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing and no one can be great without a cost,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis closed by getting personal and saying that her testimony was that of one of those young girls of color who grew up in poverty and who was sexually violated:\n\nI am always introduced as an award-winning actor. But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth. That\u2019s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence. That\u2019s what allows me to even be a citizen on this planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, hammering the point home, she said ain\u2019t nobody free till we all free.\n\n\u201cAs we live on earth, we\u2019ve got to bring everyone with us,\u201d said Davis.\n\nBrava, Ms. Davis.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

When it debuted on HBO a year later, I was 12, a latchkey kid, and the parental controls that would lock me out of my parents\u2019 premium channels after school had blessedly not been invented yet.\n\nShe\u2019s Gotta Have It was revolutionary in so many ways: in its frank discussion of sex and relationships, and the loving black-and-white lens it cast on modern black life, evocative of Gordon Parks and Roy DeCarava. (Notably, the film\u2019s cinematographer was future director Ernest Dickerson.) Equally revolutionary, its heroine: the sexually liberated, self-proclaimed \u201cpretty normal,\u201d noncommittal and nonchalant Nola Darling, played with luminous insouciance by Tracy Camilla Johns\u2014who, it should be noted, was an early icon of #TeamNatural.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect film, but it was the perfect debut of a young black filmmaker from Brooklyn, N.Y., who\u2019d clearly chosen his influences well, yet developed his own unique perspective. We\u2019d never seen anything like it.\n\nOf course, at the tender and thankfully inexperienced age of 12, what I recall most is that it was the first time I saw sex between black people depicted on-screen (Purple Rain only half counted in that respect). It was realistic and sensual and, at times, deeply problematic\u2014as I would later learn was true of offscreen sex as well. But most important, it was us, as seen by us.\n\nSo when I heard that Netflix and Spike Lee were joining forces for a reboot\u2014this time, as a series\u2014I was intrigued, especially since\u2014full disclosure\u2014I have friends and associates peppered throughout the cast, crew and production team. I couldn\u2019t help rooting for it, but still wondered: What would a new-millennial Nola Darling have to say now, in the age of Insecure and the other black female voices featured in varied nuanced narratives in the 30 years since she originally rocked our worlds?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a singer who\u2019s covered many songs, I\u2019ve made a habit of asking several questions before attempting to revise well-established work: First, is it necessary? Second, how can I make it relevant to a new audience? And finally, how can I add to and reinterpret the existing work, rather than simply regurgitate it? Doing this successfully is a delicate balance and, therefore, is a necessary exercise.\n\nFor reference, I often look to one of my favorite examples: Joni Mitchell, who revisited a couple of her breakout hits in 2000\u2019s Both Sides Now. Hearing a then 57-year-old, smoky, octave-lower Mitchell cover songs that made her famous as an ingenue 33 years before was like hearing a love letter to her younger self. I\u2019d hoped She\u2019s Gotta Have It would offer a similar opportunity, but even though Tracy Camilla Johns makes a lovely and poignant cameo (and still looks amazing), the reckoning and reinvention I was craving from this series simply was not to be.\n\nThe character of Nola Darling, an evolved woman in the mid-\u201980s, seems to have devolved during the decades since, sinking into almost every tired trope of the millennial she represents as a 26-year-old artist living in now-gentrified Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of encouraging us to consider her sexual liberation a new \u201cnormal,\u201d she seems intent on being different just for the sake of being different, offering us nothing new or exciting to consider. Frankly, many of us know far more interesting women on our Facebook feeds than this character, who has none of the cool-girl cadence of her predecessor, but all of the entitled angst often associated with her generation.\n\nThe writers also added a few plot twists that do the new Nola a disservice from the jump, making her difficult to root for. As for her supporting cast, they\u2019re an attractive and obviously talented group, but her three main suitors\u2014admittedly stereotypes in the original\u2014verge on caricatures in this version.\n\nEven the sex lacks a certain ... sexiness, since it often seems to be played for laughs. We\u2019re supposed to feel that the men in Nola\u2019s life just don\u2019t \u201cget it,\u201d but I\u2019m not sure she does, either. And while Lee has never backed down from making sure his \u201cMESSAGE!\u201d gets across, there is still rhetoric here as problematic as the rape scene in the original, and despite all attempts to confront it, victim-blaming and slut-shaming still seem to be the loudest voices in the room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the most nuanced, authentic and sensual relationships in this new version are ones that were never explored in the original. These are the moments that really shine; yet unfortunately, they are far and few between.\n\nSpike Lee, indisputably the premier filmmaker of the hip-hop generation, has mentored and championed generations of black actors, filmmakers, writers, cinematographers and producers. But as Andr\u00e9 3000 noted in a recent interview with GQ: \u201cFor me, hip-hop is about freshness. You can always hop, but you won\u2019t always be hip. At a certain point, you just won\u2019t ... the potency just moves on.\u201d\n\nLee does the right thing here (pun intended) by enlisting a variety of both fresh and seasoned voices to script these episodes, including luminaries such as Lynn Nottage, Barry Michael Cooper and Radha Blank. But watching, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how much more interesting a multiepisode arc of Do the Right Thing might\u2019ve been, allowing us to take a deeper dive into the lives of each of those iconic characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause, honestly, this series didn\u2019t convince me that Nola\u2019s is a story worth exploring beyond the 90 minutes of the original\u2014or past the 1990s at all. She was a woman who defied the conventions of her time, (mostly) unapologetically. But perhaps Nola Darling simply doesn\u2019t age well, because three decades later, Brooklyn\u2014and the world\u2014are full of Nolas, in large part because of her.", "keywords": ["nola", "lee", "later", "voices", "darling", "sex", "black", "simply", "nolas", "gotta", "shes"], "polarity": 0.18683229538492696, "subjectivity": 0.5467428039796459},

It begins with acknowledgment that black people play a pivotal role in shaping various sectors of popular culture in the U.S. In its findings, \u201c73 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 67 percent of Hispanics believe that African Americans influence mainstream culture.\u201d Congratulations to all who can clock the obvious without complication.\n\n\n\nNow, as the report shifts to its specific focus, Nielsen notes, \u201cSeveral programs with a predominantly black cast or a main storyline focusing on a black character are drawing substantial non-black viewership.\u201d\n\nExamining 2016-2017 television, the study finds:\n\nWith 89 percent nonblack viewership, This Is Us, NBC\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated ensemble dramedy, includes Sterling K. Brown as a black businessman raised by white parents and tackles topics such as drug addiction, racism, homosexuality, alcoholism, adoption, obesity and cancer.\n\nABC\u2019s hit sitcom Black-ish follows a father and husband (Anthony Anderson) who\u2019s trying to create a sense of black cultural identity for his affluent family of four and has 79 percent nonblack viewership. Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.\n\nThree-fourths of the viewers are nonblack for Secrets and Lies, the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.\n\nABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal-defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show\u2019s viewership is nonblack.\n\nSixty-eight percent of viewership is nonblack for ABC\u2019s Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes \u201cShondaLand\u201d thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.\n\nWith 63 percent nonblack viewers, Fox\u2019s Pitch is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.\n\nInsecure is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae\u2019s popular web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, viewership is 61 percent nonblack.\n\nHalf of viewership for the newcomer Atlanta is nonblack. The show, a Golden Globe-winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the tone of this study, one is supposed to find this encouraging.\n\n\n\nIndeed, of its findings, Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen, says:\n\n\n\nMuch of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen\u2019s data on television programming show something different. Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespectfully, presenting data that reveals that black-led television shows have crossover appeal is akin to other earth-shattering news like Popeyes biscuits taste like heaven in your mouth, there\u2019s nothing like being debt-free and dick too bomb.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely revealing about this information. The same goes for the study\u2019s noting that shows with a majority-black audience, like Empire, can manage to still \u201cpropel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success.\u201d\n\nYes, Taraji P. Henson is a Golden Globe-winning, Emmy-nominated actress thanks to her role as Cookie Lyon on Empire, but you know who long ago met this feat? Jack\u00e9e Harry, who remains the first and only black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She won for her role as the original Instagram model Sandra Clark on 227. 227 was a show about working-class Negroes in Washington, D.C., before the white folks took over and put bike lanes on Georgia Avenue near Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo am I supposed to be thrilled about this news that could easily have been packaged with the hashtags of #TBT or #FBF? Sorry, Nielsen, but I do decline. To be fair, Nielsen does note that television shows such as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son and The Cosby Show had already proved that our shows can be watched by all. Even so, Nielsen offers the addendum: \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t much \u2019bout al-ge-bra, but I do know if a few black shows can claim crossover appeal, an increased volume ought to yield a similar result. Us black folks are pretty diverse, don\u2019t ya know? I mean, clearly America had Negro fatigue, as evidenced by that new man in the White House, but if The Cosby Show and A Different World could thrive as trifling Ronald Reagan hollered about welfare queens and crack, Issa Rae, Donald Glover, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis can maintain success under Minute Maid Mao\u2019s mismanaged terrorist reign.\n\nSo, now that we know that the truth of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s is true in the 2010s, what will networks do about it? Will they continue to be more inclusive in their background? They could. After all, it would be nice to see more visibility in terms of class, gender and sexual orientation. We may be seeing more of us on television, but it\u2019s still not all of us. Maybe networks will finally embrace a stubborn reality and keep a great thing going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr they could follow their previous pattern of seeing our value and casting it aside anyway. In some respects, you already see that. Go ask Tamron Hall. Go ask anyone black who tried to launch a successful television show in the late 1990s or 2000s.\n\n\n\nI want to be hopeful because hope is all we have. However, while others celebrated this survey, I found it largely inconsequential. Those majority-white executives have always known that black people and black culture can reach all. It is a debate that has long been settled.\n\n\n\nAgain, the question is not can we be appreciated by all, but when will our value finally be acknowledged, accepted and, mostly, continuously invested in? Then we can ask about a proper Girlfriends series finale or full-out reunion because Joan and Toni not reuniting before the conclusion was some bullshit. Consider that a part of the reparations backstage, white people.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "sidepiece", "know", "blackled", "nielsen", "viewership", "black", "crossover", "appeal", "shows", "nonblack", "series", "treatment", "tv", "television", "golden"], "polarity": 0.1290927822177822, "subjectivity": 0.48281041874791863},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel.

After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["white", "know", "music", "im", "household", "black", "reasons", "think", "shit", "glad", "raised", "grew", "ive", "dont"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career. But when director Ryan Coogler came to her and asked if she wanted to star in his adaptation of Black Panther, she was so eager to join the project, she didn\u2019t even pause to read the script first.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvel called and said that Ryan was interested in me for a role in Panther, and I talked to him about it, and obviously everything was hush-hush, but he walked me through his initial ideas, and I thought, \u2018Wait a minute?

She said it was because she was thrilled about the story Coogler was telling, about an African country that had \u201cmanaged to keep its autonomy and be self-determining\u201d because it was shielded from colonization. Nyong\u2019o, whose father is a prominent opposition leader in Kenyan politics, said the film\u2019s implicit political themes also drew her to the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe were creating an aspirational world where an African people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy. To just have African people, black people, at the center of that narrative is so exciting.\u201d\n\nOf course, just because she didn\u2019t read the script first doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t committed. Coogler commented about her dedication to the project, saying she did \u201ca lot of homework\u201d on Black Panther in order to understand her role and the country of Wakanda. She spent months doing rigorous physical training for the complex stunt work, focusing on jujitsu and capoeira, and even injured herself during shooting. Nyong\u2019o also said she had to learn to speak with the accent actor Chadwick Boseman took on for the role, which meant utilizing clicking sounds. \u201cThere\u2019s three different clicks, like three different letters,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther comes out February 16 and we can\u2019t wait to see Nyong\u2019o in action.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["wait", "nyongo", "pumped", "read", "script", "didnt", "role", "black", "coogler", "different", "panther", "african", "sign", "lupita"], "polarity": 0.1191919191919192, "subjectivity": 0.3822330447330447},

And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle go out in his truck and shoot [the gunman] and hit him and neutralize him,\u201d Trump said, referring to Stephen Willeford, the Texas man credited with shooting and chasing off the Sutherland gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nThis point\u2014a common conservative refrain\u2014is worth pausing on.\n\nShockingly, there is a bit of nuance that Trump inadvertently introduces. Per our current gun laws, Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, should never have had a gun in the first place. Kelly\u2019s domestic violence charges were never entered into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and buy firearms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is important to remember: We can have the right laws in place, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not being enforced properly.\n\nStill, the focus on the \u201cgood guy with the gun\u201d being unable to purchase his firearm is ridiculous\u2014there is simply no way of knowing that for sure. News outlets are reporting that Willeford had a rifle and not the sort of semi-automatic weapon that would likely be subject to \u201cextreme gun vetting.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Willeford, as a former National Rifle Association instructor, was also a highly trained marksman, which is not true of many gun owners.)\n\nProclaiming that \u201chundreds\u201d more could have died, so we must be glad that only 26 lives were lost, is shameful and indicates how normalized mass murder has become in the U.S. As USA Today reports, 208 people have died in mass shootings this year alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reporter asked Trump whether he would consider any gun control policy.\n\n\u201cThe city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,\u201d Trump answered, brandishing a favorite and demonstrably false response that, in fact, highlights the need for federal gun regulations.\n\nAs a recent NPR fact check noted, Chicago\u2019s gun laws, while tough, are certainly not the strongest in the country. And while the state of Illinois is tough on guns, its neighboring states, Wisconsin and Indiana, aren\u2019t. Guns, like people, can easily move across state borders, and evidence shows that a significant percentage of Chicago\u2019s guns are trafficked in from states with lax gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than talk about Chicago again, the dotard in chief could very well have used South Korea as an example. The last deadly shootings in the country happened in 2015, in two back-to-back incidents. Immediately following the shootings (quite literally, on the first business day after the last incident), the South Korean government moved to track all guns in the country via GPS.\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["gun", "extreme", "trump", "south", "shooting", "vetting", "difference", "guns", "grit", "cheese", "laws", "reporter", "latest", "mass", "claims", "control", "korea", "demented"], "polarity": 0.05356373256373256, "subjectivity": 0.5341286676286676},

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

In fact, I\u2019ve spent more time being confounded by their inability to disappear into the hip-hop ether than I have enjoying their trapcoctions. Also, the fact that these are some \u201ctrappers\u201d from Gwinnett County \u2013 aka \"the North, that way\" aka where you move to in Atlanta when you\u2019ve made it and need to stay away from family \u2013 always rubbed me the wrong way. I realize that being \u201creal\u201d in rap is a long overrated requirement, however, sometimes knowing too much can ruin a thing.\n\nThough MC Breed was wrong when he proclaimed that there was no future in frontin, I can openly admit to enjoying several songs created by not one migo, but all three of the Migos. Moving on, because of them, in 2013, I said the word \u201cVersace\u201d at least 2,000 more times than I otherwise would have. The hook to \u201cFight Night\u201d is WAAAAAAY more fun to recite in any venue than you\u2019d believe. And while I\u2019m not both \u201cHandsome AND Wealthy\u201d, one out of two ain\u2019t bad. I guess the Migos ain\u2019t so bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings us to the Golden Globes from a few weeks back, when Donald Glover, in his infinite wisdom, made this statement while receiving one of his two awards:\n\n\u201cI really wanna thank the Migos, not for being in the show, but for making \u2018Bad and Boujee,\u2019\u201d Glover said. \u201cLike that\u2019s the best song ever.\u201d\n\nWhich was hilarious for a few reasons: 1) this statement likely helped drive \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d to the number one spot on Billboard the next week, and 2) they panned to Stevie Wonder in the audience who looked confused as if to say, \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhem.\n\nThing is, I might agree with Donald Glover. Hyperbole? Yes. But listen, that song is infectious. Here are 10 reasons why Donald Glover just might be right.\n\n1. I came to know \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d the same way MOST of us did: I kept hearing mothefuckers referencing rain drops and drop tops and had NO clue what the hell they were talking about. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and made me do the googles was some meme about what some fellow was leaving in 2016 and taking into 2017, and he was bringing \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d. Once I googled and saw it referenced a Migos song, my first inclination was to be like, \u201coh that makes sense, what\u2019s on NPR?\u201d but I listenededededed to the song for what was the first of maybe a solid, I don\u2019t know, 1,000, over the past few weeks. No lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoint is, \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d is the gateway to that song and whether they knew it or not, it\u2019s motherfucking brilliant because it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SONG AND MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER but holy shit. You\u2019ve heard no shortage of people you know and respect say \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d in the past few weeks sending you to the breaking point where you have to google it and then life.changes. I may or may not have said this in a meeting at work recently. My boss may or may not have said, \u201cI keep hearing this, what is that?\u201d Only one of the preceding sentences is false.\n\n2. The beat isn\u2019t anywhere close to being one of Metro Boomin\u2019s best beats. However, something about that slow, plodding beat is sympatico with asses clapping on stripper poles, rolling down the street smokin' indo sippin' on gin and juice , sweeping, mixing up cake batter, stapling, doing a chemistry experiment, etc. It's multi-purpose. If you walked into your progressive church and heard the beat playing as the ushers sat you down, would you be surprised? Probably not.\n\n3. Much like Waka Flocka Flame's \"Round of Applause,\" \"Bad and Boujee\" is fully appreciable by watching an ENTIRE room full of educated professionals say, \u201cmy bitch is bad and boujee, cookin\u2019 up dope with an uzi\u2026\u201d, most of whom have never seen an uzi in their entire lives and don\u2019t even realize that the very gun STOPPED BEING MANUFACTURED ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Let\u2019s talk about uzis since the Migos talk about uzis, a lot. While I\u2019d like to think that is just drug dealers talking about their hardware, I\u2019d put all of my money on the fact that because \u201cuzi\u201d rhymes with \u201cboujee\u201d it\u2019s the firearm of choice for our friendly neighborhood Subway-restaurant trappers from Lawrenceville, at least on this song. However, again, brilliant. It\u2019s got me talking about uzis again and that\u2019s almost always a good thing.\n\n5. Offset bodies both the hook and his verse. And until this song, I absolutely could not tell Offset from Takeoff, two niggas with some of the most non-awesome rap names in a long time, which is saying something because I just mentioned Waka Flocka Flame. Like, you cannot see yourself buying an album from a nigga named Offset. Or Takeoff for that matter. Quavo has the best name and is the clear standout of Migos, except on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d where, again, Offset goes for broke and puts his foot all up in this song.\n\n6. \u201cYeah, that way\u201d has been on my soul for the past three weeks. I say this whenever I can. Seriously. I stood outside Metro one day asking pedestrians if they needed directions JUST so I could say, \u201cYEAH, THAT WAY.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. I\u2019m about to get real meta for a second. There are three members of Migos: Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff. In some odd Black family way, they\u2019re all actual family, like cousins and uncles and nephews or some shit. It\u2019s Black as fuck. However, on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d, only Offset and Quavo are present along with a HORRID verse from Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert (we\u2019ll get to him later). In my head, there was a decision that had to be made where they were determining who wouldn\u2019t make the cut for \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d and they decided to take off\u2026TAKEOFF.\n\nBruh.\n\nThey taked off TAKEOFF off the song. Mind.Blown. I almost wonder if they were sitting around and had a moment of divine inspiration at the realization and Takeoff just stood up and walked out the studio. It\u2019s almost poetic. The lesson here: don\u2019t name yourself Takeoff unless you\u2019re a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert is on this song. He sucks. Tremendously. According to the social medias, he is apparently the hot nigga on the song. I contest that stress. I don\u2019t even hate the Tiny Green Gunna Boy. His song \u201cMoney Longer\u201d is a straight banger. I think he looks odd and even in this video he some how decides to tuck his t-shirt into some extra small sweatpants, which is decidedly unhip-hop. But even though his verse is the worst on the song \u2013 he doesn\u2019t say \u201cthat way\u201d not even once, the lazy tiny bastard \u2013 because the song itself is so awesome, I can live with it. He\u2019s just lucky his name isn\u2019t some shit like TakeOff. But on some EXTRA meta shit, Migos were like, we took off Takeoff, and Offset was dancing around singing about uzis and I\u2019ll bet Quavo said\u2026 \u201cbruh, there\u2019s a rapper named Uzi\u2026let\u2019s get him.\u201d\n\nMind. More blown.\n\n9. Quavo says the word \u201cratatouille\u201d like rat-a-tooly. Let that sink in. He says to call him Quavo Rat-a-tooly. That happened. You and I both know he\u2019s seen the movie Ratatouille because who hasn\u2019t. Yet and still he added in the \u201cl\u201d in what can only be described as an eff you to the French. And it was awesome. I\u2019m here for France, tho. Because lineage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The term \u201cbad and boujee\u201d itself is alliterative perfection. Offset says is in the most serendipitous way possible. They should get a Grammy for best sound recording in 2017. They won\u2019t. But they should. It works. It\u2019s employed. The Migos told me to tell you, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome.\u201d And no, serendipity didn't work up there. But neither does \"rain drops, drop tops\" and they have the number one song in the country.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema.

The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

What is to blame for this? Regarding the recent Texas church massacre, President Donald Trump stated that this was caused by a \u201cmental health problem.\u201d\n\nIn other words, guns don\u2019t kill people ... yeah, let me stop you there and dispel that myth. In 2015, suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. A total of 22,018 people used a firearm to commit suicide. Adding to that number, with the 12,979 homicides that were carried out using a firearm, there were 34,997 total deaths caused by firearm in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only November, but 2017 has been considered the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history. This despite the fact that the 1921 Tulsa, Okla., race riot; the 1923 Rosewood, Fla., massacre; and the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, just to name a few, all had greater tragic losses of life in a single instance in this country.\n\n\n\nFor the record, the current federal definition of a mass killing (pdf) is \u201cthree or more killings in a single incident and must occur in a place of public use.\u201d So far, there have been 112 people killed and 531 people wounded in mass shootings this year. To put it bluntly, guns definitely kill people ... a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s answer to these violent events is a very convenient and plausible excuse for the population as it pertains to mental health because of two things: 1) the population doesn\u2019t know a lot about mental illness to begin with, and 2) they don\u2019t want to know about mental illness. So this seems like it would make sense.\n\nBut people who have more than just a cursory knowledge of mental illness will tell you that this likely isn\u2019t mental illness.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s line of thinking has been a popular excuse for people committing violent crimes and crimes in general. But mental illness is responsible only for 3 to 5 percent of violent crimes. This means that the people who are committing violent crimes are far more likely\u201419 times more likely\u2014not to have a mental illness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good rule of thumb for most things is to understand one main concept: There is a difference between mental illness and bad behavior.\n\n\n\nJust because someone does something that is unusual or not normal to you does not mean, by default, that someone is mentally ill. I get it\u2014these events cause shock, disgust and make you feel sick. However, if there is no evaluation, you should probably err on the side of bad behavior. If the shooter was killed, there is little else to go off of other than family members, who might suffer from recall or responder bias, which makes any evaluation ultimately unreliable.\n\nA person who has not previously been diagnosed with a mental illness and who commits a violent crime is likely not suffering from mental illness and is probably just evil. Yes, I know, there is no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designation for being evil. Which is why being a bad person isn\u2019t a mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is more likely that these are horrible people with poor coping skills ... and access to firearms. Don\u2019t believe me? OK, consider this: If someone shot and killed your relative, what are you thinking of first? That the shooter had a mental illness or that the shooter was simply a horrible person? Exactly.\n\n\n\nNeed another example? OK. What if your roommate was secretly poisoning you and posting on Instagram step-by-step everything she or he did to you? Would you think that your roommate had a mental illness or that your roommate was a horrible person? Too easy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you noticed that with respect to people who commit a violent crime, the benefit of the doubt about whether they\u2019re suffering from mental illness is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in their body?\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of melanin, you are considered a thug, a terrorist and un-American. However, if you have very little melanin, you are mentally ill and are worthy of people suggesting that you had an undiagnosed, and unknown, mental illness, personality disorder or any number of other maladies, and you deserve some compassion.\n\nAfter all, why else would someone with privilege commit a crime? Affluenza, anyone?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not caping for terrorism, foreign or domestic.\n\nHowever, the selective framing and cognitive dissonance that seems to dominate the narrative of these types of incidents makes the optics of perceptions of mental illness and mental health look bad, and it is the wrong way to address these events.\n\n\n\nThe ramification of using mental illness as a scapegoat increases the stigma that is attached to mental illness. This stigma makes people far less likely to seek out professional help to improve their mental health. Not to mention it also increases the criminalization of mental illness, when, in fact, people who have mental illness are 10 times more likely to be the victims of violent crime, not the perpetrators of crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect Congress to do anything about it. It did nothing when the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings occurred in Newtown, Conn. Hell, members of Congress were actually shot at and kept right on going like nothing happened. If they don\u2019t care about their own lives, I am certain they don\u2019t care about yours. But, hey, thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n\nNeither thoughts nor prayers are going to be able to stop a bullet or people\u2019s suffering.\n\nBy the way, those survivors and family members of the victims? They are dealing with mental health challenges as they struggle to understand why their loved ones were tragically taken away and why the government repeatedly fails to prevent these senseless losses of life caused by people behaving badly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, if this is a mental health problem, perhaps Trump is to blame, because he did sign into law a bill that rolled back an Obama-administration measure that had made it harder for people with mental illness to procure firearms.\n\n\n\nBut when you have shock, disgust and emotion, who needs facts?\n\n\n\nTerrance McGill, M.D., MPH, specializes in preventive medicine, mental health and addiction medicine.

He\u2019s not just creating music for the music\u2019s sake, he\u2019s using the circumstances to make his musical career into a spectacle of its own. He controls the narrative.\n\n\n\nGlover got his artist alias, Childish Gambino, from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. In the same vein, his formative years as an emcee were equally whimsical. Glover didn\u2019t have the obscurity that he should have had during his early emceeing years as he was working to become a competent emcee.\n\nHis initial projects were given more attention than they deserved due to his involvement in Derrick Comedy and his work as a writer for 30 Rock. He later described his 2005 project, The Younger I Get, as the musings of a \u201cdecrepit Drake.\u201d The four projects that followed\u2014Sick Boi, Poindexter, I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2\u2014were released between 2008 and 2010.\n\nHighlights of this era of Childish Gambino include a nasally tone, awkward rhyme schemes, poor mixing and mediocre production. Let\u2019s be clear. These projects have not aged well. They appealed to a number of people who could appreciate his potential, his passion and his vision. He won people over with his earnest hunger and passion, despite his amateurish level of skill. We\u2019ll call this his \u201clet\u2019s build\u201d phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlover\u2019s next project, Culdesac, was the beginning of a much more calculated era in his career. It released in July 2010, only about five months after the release of I Am Not a Rapper 2. Despite the short turnaround time between projects, Culdesac was a major turning point for Gambino. He did not achieve mastery, but he came into his own as both a producer and an emcee. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two happened in tandem.\n\nThe 16-track project, which was entirely self-produced, was a definitive step up from previous releases due to the synergy between his mellow, singsong delivery style and his pop-friendly brand of production. Tracks like the Adele-sampling \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d hit a sweet spot. With this project, he was able to establish himself as a legitimate artist with household potential.\n\nHis March 2011 release, a five-track project called EP, gave us \u201cFreaks And Geeks,\u201d his most technically proficient outing as an emcee, and his most dramatic single up to that point. Gambino was growing by leaps and bounds as an emcee, and he knew it. His narrative of a vulnerable suburban black nerd was replaced by a man who knew he had the juice, thanks to lines such as \u201cNigga can\u2019t you tell, that my sample of Adele, was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowing up my cell?\u201d Clearly, that sample on \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d from Culdesac was doing numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2011, Gambino came back at us with his debut album, Camp. The 13-track project was co-produced in its entirety by his longtime collaborator, Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this was his most musically complex affair. He pieced together more elements than ever before, often haphazardly, and dove into some of the most personal narratives of his career to keep us intrigued in the midst of the chaos.\n\nThis project gave us conflicting emotions, and a complex soundscape to match. He adopted the narrative of being a black, nerdy misfit with this project before transitioning back to pushing for street credit with his next project, Royalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember how excited Gambino was to rap about \u201chood niggas\u201d blowing up his cell on the EP standout \u201cFreaks And Geeks\u201d? He wasn\u2019t joking. Cue Royalty, with guest features from the likes of Nipsey Hussle, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Bun B and Danny Brown. This is the project where Gambino made a noted push to be more accepted by mainstream hip-hop culture. Not only did he have a lot of big-name features, but he switched up his flow and subject matter to match the occasion. Vulnerabilities and insecurities were pushed to the side on songs with big-name features, as he embraced his more braggadocious side.\n\nThe fact that Gambino contended with verses from an aggressive, hungry ScHoolboy Q and a laser-sharp Ab-Soul on \u201cUnnecessary\u201d and didn\u2019t get annihilated in the process is worth talking about.\n\nTwo years earlier, Donald Glover was proud to be stringing multiple punchlines together in one verse. Had he attempted this two years earlier, it would have been ugly. At this point in the game, he had the tools in his arsenal to rise to the occasion, and he did, gaining the approval of a number of more \u201chip-hop purist\u201d-oriented fans in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatisfied with the acclaim swirling around Royalty, Glover moved into a different phase of his career once more, with a different goal in mind. In the same year that he left Community, he released his second studio album, a very mysterious album called Because the Internet.\n\nKeep in mind that Glover was known primarily as a comedian during the formative years of his career as a musician. After the release of Royalty, he had gained a significant amount of respect for his talent as a musician.\n\nBecause the Internet took on a much more experimental, psychedelic feel. Instrumentation was less bright and more nuanced. Subject matter was pushed into more universal territory. While we could feel the ever-present chip on Gambino\u2019s shoulder with previous projects, Because the Internet centered around artistry and pushed hubris to the side. Painting a picture became the focus. Donald Glover wanted to be taken more seriously as an artist, and critics largely did just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2014, Gambino came back with a double release, STN MTN/Kauai. It\u2019s important to note that STN MTN was released as a mixtape, while Kauai was released as en EP. While Kauai served as a more polished, introspective dose of his pop-friendly, R&B alter ego, STN MTN was where he set out to make a statement.\n\nThe first words on STN MTN? \u201cI had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station.\u201d While the project title clearly shouts out his hometown of Stone Mountain, the project is so Atlanta it\u2019s not even funny.\n\nGambino teams up with local mainstay Kari Faux for \u201cSmall Talk,\u201d references Atlanta strip club Follies during interludes, and raps over a host of instrumentals made iconic by Atlanta artists. While it was more beneficial to focus on the Stone Mountain narrative in earlier, more vulnerable projects like Camp, the more cocky, braggadocious Gambino puts on for Atlanta with confidence this time around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe sings a beautiful falsetto cover of Usher\u2019s \u201cU Don\u2019t Have to Call\u201d on the project, and includes an insightful, entertaining narrative at the end. He mentions, \u201cI was never a thug, and they used to respect me for it. But now the game is fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas.\u201d\n\nMichael Corleone is the main protagonist of The Godfather, and he has one key thing in common with Glover; the determination to accomplish his goals by any means, even if it means losing everything in the process and rebuilding from scratch.\n\nIn what might be his most drastic transformation to date, Gambino released Awaken, My Love! on Dec. 2, 2016. In the same way that Michael Corleone destroyed everything that stood in his way in The Godfather, Glover destroyed almost every preconception of his artistry with this project, diving deep into influences such as Bootsy Collins, Parliament and Prince to deliver a spacey, soulful ode to different eras of black artistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe progression he\u2019s taken as an artist is one of a man equally committed to risk-taking and perfection. Most importantly, he\u2019s dedicated to being an artist whose shifts, whims and phases continue to force us to reconsider his limitations. He chooses to hone in on specific elements such as his emceeing, production, singing and composition, adopting different personas to fit the nature of the chapter of his story that he\u2019s penning in the moment.\n\nWhen he feels that he\u2019s mastered a particular element of his artistry, he soars with it and embraces the full vision he has for it, as seen in the braggadocious lyricism of Royalty, the bold experimentalism of Because the Internet, the sharp contrast of STN MTN/Kauai, and the transcendental funk of Awaken, My Love!.\n\nWhen he\u2019s still putting the pieces together, he falls back on the familiarity of his vulnerable, relatable childhood narrative as a black kid who didn\u2019t quite fit in to make himself more relatable. Culdesac and Camp, arguably his two least confidently executed projects, are prime examples of this, as they center around introspection. Glover is one of the most adept musical chameleons in that oftentimes, we don\u2019t even recognize that he\u2019s donned a disguise to shift the way that we receive him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Glover a manipulative mastermind with some sort of dark, underlying motive? Most likely not. Is he a very emotionally intelligent, masterful communicator with a knack for using the reality of his situation and the limitations of his talents to his benefit? Absolutely.\n\nJust remember that in addition to his musical exploits, he will always be an actor, a comedian and a storyteller. His musical career is an integral element of his story as a man and as a creative, and he will always be in complete control of the plot, pulling strings from behind the scenes and watching the audience react from the rafters.", "keywords": ["hiphops", "adept", "narrative", "projects", "project", "donald", "glover", "chameleon", "artist", "gambino", "career", "stn", "hes", "released"], "polarity": 0.12009195893926436, "subjectivity": 0.4956658112346737},

The annual Democrats-vs.-Republicans baseball game was a day away, and the participants were just wrapping up a successful workout.\n\n\n\nNobody suspected a mass shooting.\n\nRep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, said he thinks that as he was leaving the field, he encountered the shooter, who asked if the players were Democrats or Republicans. It was an ordinary exchange that Duncan said was not in any way \u201cearth-shattering,\u201d and he made his way with colleagues up to Capitol Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Duncan recognized that there had been a shooting, and that it was a late-middle-aged \u201cnormal looking\u201d white man who had perpetrated the attack on sitting U.S. legislators, he also recognized that it was the same man who\u2019d spoken to him.\n\nJames T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Bellville, Ill., was identified as the man who used a rifle to unload dozens of rounds, leaving the legislators and their aides and onlookers to seek refuge in the dugout or to cover in place in the dirt and grass.\n\nEyewitness interviews described the shooter as being \u201cnormal looking,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d \u201ca little on the chubby side,\u201d \u201cprobably Anglo\u201d and \u201cregular.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the press conference, Alexandria police officials and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe stressed that it was \u201cnot likely\u201d that Hodgkinson held any ties to terrorist organizations. According to the New York Times, he did hold some resentment over Donald Trump\u2019s election. This, again, was a likely case of a lone-wolf, again, white man with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the gunman has since died from his injuries, he lived long enough to be taken to George Washington University Hospital, where the care he received is among the best in the region. His victims are all expected to recover.\n\nThe highest-profile of the shooting victims is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the Republican who represents the 1st Congressional District of Louisiana in the suburbs of New Orleans. Scalise was hit in the hip, and the surgery to repair his gunshot wound is reported by authorities to have been successful.\n\nAmid the platitudes about thoughts and prayers and unity that are all too common after such events, what we\u2019re not yet hearing is some common sense and some clear definitions to call a thing what it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, this was indeed a terrorist act. Hunting down legislators, even those with whom one disagrees, is a crime that holds at its center the intent to make an example of the shot politician. The logic is simple: Vote my way or this could happen to you.\n\nThe man who perpetuated this terrorism was a terrorist.\n\nBlack shooters and brown shooters do not get such benefit of the doubt. If any black or brown person shoots and kills, one never hears the phrase, \u201cThis is an EDP,\u201d an \u201cemotionally disturbed person.\u201d Instead, cue the tired rhetoric, \u201cThis thug needs to be put down,\u201d or \u201cThose people practice a violent religion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe talk of mental illness is immediate when a white man takes up his arms and turns them against innocents. Despite that, the overwhelming majority of people who have mental illness never become violent, terroristic killers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if we are to grant that this particular shooter in the Alexandria incident did suffer from mental illness, there is still a main question to be answered. And it should be laid at the feet of Scalise and his similar-voting colleagues on Capitol Hill. We have to ask legislators, \u201cCan we talk about protecting Americans from the proven threat that is domestic terror?\u201d\n\nScalise holds an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. He also was on Donald Trump\u2019s Second Amendment Coalition, which wants to make it easier for residents of the District of Columbia to obtain guns. He has also fought to do away with provisions restricting mentally ill people from buying guns. Scalise co-sponsored the Firearms Interstate Commerce Reform Act, which aimed to remove restrictions on interstate firearms transactions.\n\nWhile the Second Amendment is treated as a sacred edict from the heavens, never to be touched, these are legislators who are happy to change laws about voting rights, equal access to women\u2019s health care and mental-health care as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese legislators, and much of the media, too, are far too comfortable with the status quo that white men with guns are the prime illustration of what it is to be an American\u2014no matter on whom they turn those weapons.\n\nIt was almost a year ago when GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul was uninjured Wednesday as he and other legislators fled the hail of gunfire while another lone-wolf white man with a gun unleashed his fury at unarmed people who couldn\u2019t defend themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s time to do more than wring our hands and talk about how futile it is to even make a request for a real conversation about this issue.\n\nCongress must absolutely get in line with medical professionals, who explain that gun violence is a public health issue, just like clean water and safe food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we must all do a better job in calling a terrorist a terrorist. Even if he\u2019s a \u201cnormal looking\u201d white man.\n\n\n\nNo one, not even GOP legislators, should be scared of being shot down in the outfield.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "terrorist", "man", "shooter", "shooting", "way", "legislators", "normal", "gop", "va", "sway", "scalise", "violence", "talk", "mental"], "polarity": 0.03838569518716577, "subjectivity": 0.4320072084777966},

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had. I\u2019d met Sandra [Choi] at the Bowery hotel, and I always had this idea within my collection to sort of get more specific and story-tell ... I was working on this collection that was a tribute to Princess Diana and [Jimmy Choo] were a shoemaker that were making shoes for her. And I thought it could have been a cool way to relate the product and the narrative of Princess Diana to a younger audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think that no matter what Abloh does, he\u2019s got a firm creative hold on the zeitgeist and will surely remain part of the greatest show on earth.", "keywords": ["abloh", "fashion", "offwhite", "kind", "kendall", "princess", "collaboration", "choo", "covet", "collection", "bnyfw", "jimmy", "jenner"], "polarity": 0.23849431818181818, "subjectivity": 0.49405513468013457},

Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth (2013)\n\nThis film surprised me. Mike Tyson is a tragically flawed yet magnetically charismatic man\u2014Lee films him empathetically.\n\n18. Summer of Sam (1999)\n\nThis tells the story of the 1977 serial murders that took place in New York City. It builds suspense competently, but I have no idea what Lee was trying to say with the film.

Get on the Bus (1996)\n\nThis story about black men on a bus to the Million Man March flirts dangerously with emotional manipulation, but the performances of Ossie Davis, Charles S. Dutton, Bernie Mac, Andre Braugher and others save the film from sentimentality.\n\n\n\n16. Clockers (1995)\n\nAn examination of the interconnectedness of those who investigate crimes and those who commit them, Lee\u2019s Clockers is a precursor to The Wire in form and style.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. If God Is Willing and de Creek Don\u2019t Rise (2010)\n\nThis sequel to Lee\u2019s brilliant When the Levees Broke is haunting. It showed us just how much work remained to be done after Hurricane Katrina while examining the impact of the BP oil spill of 2010. His ability to construct a vibrant narrative using the documentary format is on full display in this HBO film.\n\nThe remaining films are what made Spike Lee Spike Lee. The following are all legitimately great films worthy of deep examination and deconstruction. My ranking of his top 14 films changes almost yearly, but I am willing to go to blows with anyone who denies their brilliance\u2014even while I am willing to admit that they are not all flawless in their execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. 25th Hour (2002)\n\nA rarity for Lee in that almost exclusively white actors populate it, this film grapples brilliantly with the moral nihilism that we all felt in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\n\n13. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nThis felt like Lee just wanted to say something about interracial relationships\u2014essentially that they would not work. But yo, this movie is riveting. The directorial flair, the acting, the music and the fact that \u201cjungle fever\u201d is now a part of the public lexicon places this firmly in the upper echelon of his filmography.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Inside Man (2006)\n\nDenzel Washington, Lee\u2019s frequent collaborator, is electric and makes the film work, but at this point in his career, this is a movie that I did not think Lee would make. A fun potboiler that shows us what is possible when Lee cuts back on his self-indulgent tendencies and focuses on a narrative.\n\n\n\n11. Bamboozled (2000)\n\nThis satire examines the vicious legacy of blackface in light of contemporary depictions of black Americans in popular media. It took me years to fully appreciate what Lee was up to, but now, looking back as a philosopher of race, I see that Lee\u2019s film is both prophetic about our contemporary moment and eternally relevant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)\n\nThis film turned D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and the late Bernie Mac into household names. Lee\u2019s swooping camera and clinical approach to the art of comedy centers the work that goes into the seeming effortlessness of the black expression of the art form.\n\n9. Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990)\n\nMy favorite of Lee\u2019s films uses the medium of jazz as a lens to meditate on the plight of black artists. Patriarchy and emotional abuse that are never fully critiqued keep Mo\u2019 Better Blues from being higher on the list, but the score and the performances of Joie Lee, Spike\u2019s sister, and Denzel elevate this otherwise small film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She\u2019s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nLee\u2019s first feature-length film is a French new-wave examination of the sexual double standards faced by black women filtered through Italian neorealism. His willingness to experiment with form, a major reason that his later films are not as successful, is how he made his name as a filmmaker. This film is now streaming on Netflix, and I am interested to see how the streaming service will update and expand upon the foundation Lee laid in its upcoming series.\n\n\n\n7. He Got Game (1998)\n\nLee knows basketball. A lifelong Knicks fan, he is known for his courtside antics cheering for a team that has not won a championship since Richard Nixon was in the White House. This film, both a love letter to the game and a searing indictment of the corruption that surrounds it, boasts a great Washington performance and a surprisingly competent one from Ray Allen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. 4 Little Girls (1996)\n\nHeartbreaking and raw, Lee\u2019s documentary about how the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., still haunts the family members of the four girls who died that day should have won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year. It let us know that Lee was not just a maker of fictional films and that he was a force to be reckoned with as a documentarian.\n\n\n\n5. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006)\n\nThis is Lee\u2019s magnum opus as a documentarian. It tells the story of Hurricane Katrina and shows how the U.S. government failed the people of the 9th Ward in every respect. It is required viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. School Daze (1988)\n\nBlack Greek organizations, magical realism, an HBCU football team that loses in embarrassing fashion during homecoming, Afrocentrism in tension with respectability politics, a song about colorism in the black community\u2014School Daze is everything.\n\n\n\n3. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nLee\u2019s most emotionally resonant film is an autobiographical story about a black family in the 1970s. For many it is their favorite, but the only reason it is not higher on my list is that the next two are so much more ambitious\u2014but depending on the day, this could easily find itself in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nMany consider this Lee\u2019s greatest film. It is a brilliant examination of black rage in the wake of the absurdity imposed by white supremacist police violence, a theme that still has resonance today. In fact, many were concerned that black folks would riot because of the climactic scenes. And yet this is a strikingly beautiful film. His frequent cinematographer Ernest Dickerson seizes every opportunity to use the lens to create striking images. This could be No. 1 if not for the sheer audacity of the film Lee made 25 years ago last week ...\n\n\n\n1. Malcolm X (1992)\n\nWhat can I add that has not already been written about this film? Washington should have won the Oscar. Lee should have won the Oscar. Angela Bassett should have won the Oscar. Whoever was the conk-hair consultant should have won an Oscar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee\u2019s depiction of the legendary historical figure was flawed because he used The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a foundation for the narrative, but that does not take away from the power of the film. He needed the help of Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent black folks to finish the film, and I\u2019m glad they came through financially. This is Lee\u2019s best film. The one he was born to make.\n\n\n\nHe is not a perfect filmmaker\u2014I\u2019m still lost for what I should think about Red Hook Summer\u2014but when he is on his game, he is among the best filmmakers in America.", "keywords": ["best", "lee", "ranked", "spike", "black", "x", "lees", "movies", "films", "work", "malcolm", "25", "won", "film"], "polarity": 0.1633188557005125, "subjectivity": 0.4983504414717432},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including: I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017); not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow, Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most-anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film, while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now-legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now, I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So, I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience; working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously only known as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation ... it\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe,\u201d due to its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city like New York, and you divide it by, you know, Midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, Uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, much of which has been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u2018They\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u2019 We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between, because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 16\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now-classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together. But even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up:\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So, I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to ever win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which comprise most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["feel", "know", "felt", "theyre", "wakanda", "cultural", "black", "marveldisney", "film", "panther", "costumes", "wannabes", "carter", "consciousness", "ruth"], "polarity": 0.20297206324748698, "subjectivity": 0.4685596888986719},

All for some misbegotten plan that he cooked up in his head to start a race war.\n\nRoof seems to have inhabited some dark corner of the world where hate-filled little men go to stew in their own vitriol and ass-backward beliefs about whatever specific groups they either distrust, flat out hate or blame for making their world such a horrible place. Whether I like it or not, it\u2019s their right to go online, to a bar, to a shack in the woods or any other place to do so, but unfortunately, every now and then, the Dylann Roofs of the world decide to put words into action, and now nine families, a church, a town, a state and a nation have had to deal with the fallout.\n\nAlmost a year before Roof\u2019s alleged actions at Mother Emanuel, another angry young man, Elliot Rodger, shot and stabbed his way through an area near the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six and injuring 14. Rodger left behind YouTube videos and manifestos to illustrate his motives in the most frightening ways possible. Unlike Roof\u2019s, Rodger\u2019s hatred was mostly focused on women and his lack of success with them. To wage this \u201cwar on women,\u201d little Elliot Rodgers went out and purchased a Glock 34 and a pair of Sig Sauer P226 pistols, then took out his rage on a group of innocent people. All before killing himself like a coward.\n\nThat brings us to Omar Mateen, whose deeds are fresh in our minds. In what seems be a strange mix of self-hatred, religion-based homophobia and extremist Islamic beliefs, Mateen killed 49 patrons of Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. He started shooting people simply because they were either homosexual, allied with the LGBT community or just dancing before last call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe really messed-up part is that mass shootings will happen again. I don\u2019t know when or how soon, but something akin to this will occur at some point. The same questions will be asked. The same expressions of sorrow and concern will be made. The nation\u2019s leaders will opine on the state of things and what can be done to prevent this from happening again, and the public will forget about it all within a few months.\n\nOne of the few certainties about these incidents is that they have two frightening commonalities: an angry young man and guns. No matter where you are, a young man who feels wronged and possesses a gun is a recipe for disaster. The stamped metal of a Kalashnikov, the plastic polymer of an AR-15 and the 2 pounds\u2019 worth of steel that make up most handguns have forever made small, angry men feel big.\n\nSadly, in the United States, which fancies itself a \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation, these angry little men have utilized their Second Amendment rights to wage an assault on those who have drawn their ire. And the next mass shooting will be another reminder that, while we will never run out of angry young men, we have failed in preventing them from arming themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a gun owner, I find myself running through various scenarios on how to regulate an industry with constitutional protection and tons of money to lobby politicians to limit gun control. I\u2019m honestly fresh out of ideas on how to force the government and the gun industry into supporting stricter gun measures. What would it take to scare America into saying, \u201cOK, we need to seriously rethink the kind of guns we allow on the streets\u201d?\n\nLast November, actor Wendell Pierce tweeted, \u201cIf every Black male 18-35 applied for a conceal & carry permit, and then joined NRA in one day; there would be gun control laws in a second.\u201d\n\nSure, it sounds insane, but I bet it would work. Although I would never join the National Rifle Association, I wonder if gun regulations would change. I can\u2019t help pondering how those who are staunchly opposed to gun control would spin their new views given the NRA\u2019s history with the Black Panther Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not we pass stricter gun control, America has a serious problem, and on any given day, we could find ourselves trapped in a nightmare like the folks at Mother Emanuel, Pulse or UC Santa Barbara just because some angry little man got a gun and decided to make some twisted statement.\n\n\n\nKeith Young lives in Charleston, S.C.

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns.

Now, 25 years later, he has directed Roger Guenveur Smith\u2019s one-man show, Rodney King. Interestingly, Rodney King premieres on Netflix the day before the one on which the cops who beat King were acquitted in 1992. Smith and Lee are longtime collaborators dating all the way back to School Daze. Chi-Raq was their latest before now.\n\n\n\nRodney King may be one of the lone dramatic pieces dealing with the Los Angeles riots, but it is far from the only one. There are a few by other black directors, including Los Angeles native John Singleton\u2019s A&E documentary, L.A. Burning: The Riots 25 Years Later, and longtime Los Angeles resident John Ridley\u2019s ABC documentary, Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992. And they all, says Lee, have merit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not a competition. Singleton\u2019s my guy. John Ridley\u2019s my guy. There\u2019s not one to tell the story so I hope people see all those documentaries about the uprising,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAll black directors don\u2019t think alike.\u201d\n\nBut Rodney King was all Smith\u2019s doing, says Lee. Smith conceived the one-man show shortly after King\u2019s death in 2012 and came to Lee to direct it after performing the show for years.\n\n\u201cIt started because I wanted to make a statement in that season of mourning and I wanted to explore my own emotions,\u201d explains Smith. \u201cYou know, \u2018Why do I feel this way? And why might my audience, my potential audience, feel this tremendous sense of loss?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo I started digging into the Rodney King archives the same way that anybody could these days: Just Google Rodney King,\u201d he continues. \u201cAll kinds of great articles, interviews with him, came up. Don Lemon did an amazing interview with him on CNN. He wasn\u2019t shy about revealing himself to a certain degree and so, by the first week of August, I was onstage trying to work it out.\u201d\n\nSmith actually never expected the show to last this long. \u201cI thought that it was just going to be for that summer and it would be kind of a memorial for Rodney King and a meditation on that loss, but it continued to resonate in all kinds of ways, many of them tragic because this thing called America happened. ... We have these code words now: Staten Island, Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, the list is endless. So doing this piece live all over the country and all over the world has, unfortunately, given it a certain resonance that I had no idea that it would live with over these several seasons that I\u2019ve been doing it.\u201d\n\nTo make the one-man show more cinematic, Smith turned to Lee. And, to that end, Lee had 10 cameras capturing Smith performing the play in Brooklyn, N.Y. So while the filming process was one take, it took months to edit. And, as a result, it\u2019s very nuanced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe way the cameras zone in on and out from Smith onstage, the lighting, the sound effects, the music by Marc Anthony Thompson, all of it works to deliver moments larger than life, which is fitting, since the performance is about more than just Rodney King. It\u2019s about specific incidents like the LAPD\u2019s brutal beating of King and the slaying of Latasha Harlins, the 15-year-old girl shot to death by Korean shop owner Soon Ja Du, as well as larger issues of race and inequality in this country. Of course, we learn about Rodney King, the man, not just the catalyst to the Los Angeles riots.\n\n\u201cI think that this is a testament to the great amount of research that Roger Guenveur Smith did,\u201d says Lee, \u201cbecause you get to know who he is, you get to know who Rodney King is as an individual, as a human being, because he\u2019s being demonized, and the portrayal or the information about him is very limited, and Roger goes all in.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Smith is intrigued by King\u2019s drowning death. \u201cRodney King loved the water,\u201d he shares. \u201cHe was a surfer. He was a [jet] skier. He loved to swim. He loved to fish. He loved being in and near the water in all of its forms, and to go to the bottom of the pool like that is kind of out of character for him considering his abilities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more curious, King\u2019s father died in a bathtub of water, says Smith. More correlations are made throughout the work, which is very dense and very thoughtful. Smith doesn\u2019t shy away from the weight that was placed on King, especially during the riots. \u201cHe most tragically had to watch the loss of 56 people in his name,\u201d shares Smith. \u201cFifty-six lives were lost. Interestingly enough, the same number of blows that it was determined that the LAPD gave him. Fifty-six. So that\u2019s a tremendous weight that brought him to that microphone on May Day, May 1, 1992 [when King made his \u201cCan we all just get along\u201d cry to end the riot]. Tremendous weight.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s the same weight that took the brother to the bottom of his pool on Father\u2019s Day 2012,\u201d adds Smith, a longtime L.A. resident who was himself detained during the riots. \u201cThat was a lot to live with. And he was not a tutored man. He was not even a high school graduate.\n\n\u201cAfter the beating, they tried to have him take courses in black history to make him into a spokesperson, but he wasn\u2019t going to do that,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t Rodney\u2014or Glen, I should say\u2014because Rodney was a person that emerged from the media construct. His family and friends always called him Glen. So he was literally called out of his name.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodney King begins streaming on Netflix April 28.", "keywords": ["riots", "weight", "rodney", "lee", "guenveur", "spike", "way", "speak", "smith", "loved", "roger", "los", "king", "angeles", "netflix", "film"], "polarity": 0.14814555074555077, "subjectivity": 0.5230994708994708},

Weinstein had not only donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party but had also hosted fundraisers that the Obamas attended. But the allegations hit particularly close to home for the Obamas because Malia had just wrapped up a coveted internship with the mogul\u2019s production company a few months ago.\n\nFrom CBS News:\n\nMichelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture \u2014 including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect \u2014 so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\n\nMalia landed her internship with the Weinstein Co. earlier this year, working with the production and development department. Many have speculated about what the 19-year-old may have known about the Hollywood producer\u2019s alleged predatory behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie joined the growing list of women who claim that Weinstein harassed or abused them.\n\nOne of the stronger condemnations of Hollywood\u2019s treatment of women came from Black Panther director Ryan Coogler. The director\u2019s debut, Fruitvale Station, about the death of Oscar Grant at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in 2009, was released by the Weinstein Co.\n\nShadow and Act released Coogler\u2019s statement in full. The acclaimed filmmaker said he was \u201cdisturbed and saddened\u201d by the news, adding that he was unaware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior but felt a responsibility to speak on the issue because of his connection to the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Coogler didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nI love working as a storyteller. But I work in an industry that too many times has proven to not be a safe space for women. I make it a priority to ensure that there is gender equity and an inclusive work environment on every project I am involved with. However, just minding our business sometimes isn\u2019t enough. It goes without saying, but I will state it now: sexual harassment is a human rights violation, sexual assault is a human rights violation, rape is a human rights violation. The entertainment industry, like many others, has a historic imbalance of power among gender that allows these violations to run rampant. As men we sit in positions of privilege. It is our responsibility to leverage our position, and be allies to the women in our industry. We need to do everything we can to make sure violations like these don\u2019t continue to happen. The first step is to listen. Salute to the brave women who came forward. I could never imagine how difficult that must be.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Coogler has been walking the talk on gender inclusivity in Hollywood, unlike some of the actors and directors who have given lukewarm expressions of shock at the Weinstein allegations.\n\nThe scandal, long regarded as an \u201copen secret\u201d in Hollywood, according to some reports, has forced the entertainment industry to confront the ways it enables and reinforces systems of abuse and exploitation. The Weinstein story in particular has prompted many big names to come out about harassment they\u2019ve suffered.

If Batman is DC Comics\u2019 king of out-of-nowhere moments of surprise, T\u2019Challa handily takes the crown for Marvel. Here\u2019s a few times he grandly let us know he\u2019s always a few steps ahead of Marvel\u2019s mightiest.\n\n\n\nThe Time He Absolutely Clowned the Fantastic Four\n\nBlack Panther is a man who\u2019s all about plans, and he\u2019s literally been doing it since his first appearance, all the way back in 1966's Fantastic Four #52. T\u2019Challa invites the Fantastic Four to his isolated nation by gifting them a fancy hovercraft, only to use the opportunity to test their skills as a fighting unit. It does... not go well for the FF gang.\n\nDonning his Black Panther garb, T\u2019Challa systematically hunts down each member of the team, strategizing how to best isolate them all and counteract their superpowers. He does it easily, too, and only relents\u2014to bluntly inform them it was merely a test of their skills and little more than an experiment to him\u2014when they get a chance to gang up on him. But it was a hell of an entrance to make, nonetheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Exposed His Identity to the World\n\nBy the time the \u201860s were over, T\u2019Challa\u2019s adventures were branching out beyond the borders of Wakanda. He was a card-carrying Avenger and started regularly operating in the US alongside the rest of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes. But T\u2019Challa also found himself and his fellow Avengers caught up in bubbling racial tension in the country, stoked by hateful debates on a popular talk show... and the fact that there had been sightings of the Black Panther running around committing petty crimes, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out the whole thing was a plan stoked by the Sons of the Serpents to try and kick off a new civil war, with the unmasking of their \u201ccriminal\u201d Black Panther imposter as a black, anti-white activist on national television as a catalyst. T\u2019Challa himself spends most of the story on the run from the allegations against him, and is ultimately captured by the Serpents\u2014but he saves the day in the climax by smashing his way onto TV to unmask the Serpent\u2019s faux-Panther, who it turns out was actually a white guy wearing an elaborate mask. In the process, he reveals his own identity to the watching world, but T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t care in the slightest.\n\nThe Time He Stopped Iron Man\u2019s Heart\n\nOkay, this doesn\u2019t technically happen to \u201cour\u201d Tony Stark\u2014it happens to a sinister time paradox version of him during the twisty-turny, time travel shenanigans of the \u201cEnemy of the State II\u201d storyline in Christopher Priest and Sal Velluto\u2019s Black Panther back in 2002. But our Tony watches T\u2019Challa go up against the time-twisted version of himself, clad in special armor to counteract Black Panther\u2019s vibranium-enhanced suit, and is absolutely horrified to see what T\u2019Challa is more than willing to do to fight him, if the need ever arises (which, given that superheroes love to fight each other all the time, is a logical potential future).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not just that T\u2019Challa beats the time paradox Iron Man, though, it\u2019s the way he does it. He overwhelms the functions of Iron Man\u2019s suit, not just disabling it, but literally stopping evil Tony\u2019s heart in the process. That alone scares the bejesus out of regular Tony, but when he confronts T\u2019Challa about it afterward, it\u2019s the fact that Black Panther casually admits he\u2019s fine having a back-up plan like that against one of his closest friends that truly surprises Iron Man.\n\nThe Time He Dumped Storm\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Storm and Black Panther\u2019s marriage, but T\u2019Challa ended it as ruthlessly as he would any fight with a supervillain during the Avengers vs. X-Men event in the bluntest, harshest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly at the time, T\u2019Challa was going through a hell of a lot, as Wakanda had been through catastrophic destruction at the hands of a Phoenix Force-infused Namor. But while the disastrous aftermath pained T\u2019Challa, what incensed him even more was that Storm chose to stay with the X-Men instead of coming to Wakanda to offer her godlike powers in assistance. So when she does eventually show up to offer aid, T\u2019Challa bluntly refuses it. And then promptly tells her\u2014surrounded by their fellow heroes\u2014that as Chief of the Panther clan, he had already annulled their marriage, and that she is no longer welcome in Wakanda.\n\nLater on in the series when the Avengers and X-Men start duking out, as the title implies, he rubs salt in the wound by fighting Storm and revealing he\u2019s always known how to disable her weather-controlling powers, then beats her easily in hand-to-hand combat. Ouch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Wiped Out the Wakanda\u2019s Entire Vibranium Supply to Screw Over Doctor Doom\n\nThe 2010 storyline \u201cDoomwar\u201d is a tough one for Black Panther; it\u2019s a moment when he finds himself not just defeated, but overthrown by none other than Doctor Doom himself. Doom doesn\u2019t just covertly take over Wakanda, either, but even offers himself up to the panther god Bast, allowing him access to Wakanda\u2019s vibranium reserves after he humiliatingly steals them from under T\u2019Challa\u2019s nose.\n\nEventually, after infiltrating Latveria in return and almost starting an all-out war, Black Panther eventually confronts Doom in a one-on-one battle. Doom mocks T\u2019Challa for his and Wakanda\u2019s overreliance on vibranium, only for T\u2019Challa to agree... and then send a signal boosted through Doom\u2019s suit that rendered every piece of Wakandan vibranium in the world inert. It robs Doom of his advantage in a moment of total shock, but it also left T\u2019Challa and Wakanda in a suddenly intriguing new state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Was Daredevil\n\nThe year 2010 was a hectic time for Black Panther. Remember when, err, Daredevil became head of the Hand Ninja Clan and then kinda sorta got possessed by a demon and went evil/mad? \u201cShadowland\u201d was a whole thing that caused not just the street-level heroes of New York to get involved, but a good chunk of Marvel\u2019s mightiest too, including T\u2019Challa. At the end of the storyline Matt Murdock sacrifices himself to defeat the demon within, leaving Hell\u2019s Kitchen without its usual protector for a period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is, until T\u2019Challa\u2014who at the time wasn\u2019t Wakanda\u2019s king, having passed on the mantle of Black Panther and of the nation\u2019s rule to his sister, Shuri\u2014 decides to stick around and become Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s premier superhero. It led to the great series Black Panther: The Most Dangerous Man Alive by David Liss and Jefte Palo, but it\u2019s really just the surprise of T\u2019Challa looking around in the wake of \u201cShadowland\u201d and basically going \u201cThis is my turf now\u201d that\u2019s the fun part.\n\nThe Time He Smacked Dr. Doom Around With the Infinity Gauntlet\n\nThe climactic moments of 2015's Secret Wars see the gathered heroes of (what\u2019s left of) the Marvel universe take the fight to \u201cGod Doom,\u201d a wildly powerful Victor Von Doom who forged the Battleworld out of the shattered remnants of the Marvel multiverse in the wake of the universe-mashing \u201cconvergence.\u201d Few people can go up against Doom in such a god-like state... and those few include T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not just T\u2019Challa as he normally he is. He\u2019s wielding an Infinity Gauntlet from one of the myriad destroyed universes, something that would destroy most people in an instant, or drive them mad. But through sheer force of will, and much to Doom\u2019s surprise, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t just have the capacity to use it, but is very happy to use it to beat the hell out of God Doom\u2014at least long enough to distract him from Reed Richard\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Time He Got Into a War of Words With Galactus... and Won\n\nIf you want another series that highlights what a wildly smart (and thoroughly prepared) Black Panther can look like, the recent Ultimates book from Al Ewing and Kenneth Rocafort is a great choice. Because not only do you get to see Black Panther on a cosmic-level superteam, you get to see him do the nearly impossible: Stand toe-to-toe with the devourer of worlds himself and come out on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ultimates\u2019 first mission sees them attempt to solve \u201cthe Galactus problem,\u201d which is to say they want to stop the giant almighty cosmic being who eats planets from continually returning to Earth for a snack. Naturally, the team leaves the bulk of this plan down to T\u2019Challa, so he casually transports himself to Galactus\u2019 realm (an act that, like wielding an Infinity Gauntlet, would drive most people mad) and... just talks to Galactus. Actually, he doesn\u2019t just talk to Galactus, but debates him, running intellectual circles around the world-devourer long enough that the rest of the Ultimates have the time to enact their plan to blast Galactus into the chamber that created him in the first place, turning him into the heroic Life-Bringer instead.

As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

Ninety years of Jim Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal.\u2026 Read more Read\n\nPart of his The Root 100 bio read:\n\n\n\nTwo years in the making, Coates begins \u201cThe Case\u201d\u2014which set a single-day record for traffic to TheAtlantic.com, as well as swelled newsstand sales\u2014with an individual, whom we follow from his terror-filled childhood in Mississippi through his migration to the redlined ghettos of Chicago. In documenting just how vast and entrenched inequality has been for African Americans specifically, Coates also casts a side eye to the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps trope favored by so many because \u2026 well, there were no boots to speak of. African-American disparity, you see, is \u201ca difference of kind.\u201d No. If we are going to talk about reparations, payment for \u201cmulticentury plunder of black people in America,\u201d we must look to the bedrock of this nation\u2019s very foundation and the lens through which we view ourselves.\n\nAbout a year later, Coates released Between the World and Me, a tome Toni Morrison hailed as \u201crequired reading,\u201d cementing him as one of America\u2019s foremost public intellectuals. The accolades came fast and furious: Coates was tapped to write a Black Panther comic book series, and he won a National Book Award and then a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant,\u201d with a $625,000 windfall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI won all of that money,\u201d he concedes. \u201cThat\u2019s probably been the biggest change in my life.

[and] you end up with 900,000 Twitter followers, it\u2019s different,\u201d he tells The Root. \u201cI think you have a number of writers, or people in general, who have fame as a goal, and I\u2019m just being straight with you\u2014this is not false modesty\u2014I just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe object always, he says, was \u201cto be the baddest motherfucking writer on the planet.\u201d Not the baddest black writer, mind you, but the baddest writer on the planet. \u201cNow, this is the sort of thing that could make you famous,\u201d he says, laughing, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think about that.\n\n\u201cWho cares about writers?

Carter School of Journalism in the fall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s also readying for the release of his book We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy (One World), to be released in October. Coates explains that the title comes from black Reconstruction-era Rep. Thomas Miller, who plaintively noted at the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1895, \u201cWe were eight years in power,\u201d and then questioned why Southern whites despised blacks so much, when their works during Reconstruction were good.\n\n\u201cIt had tremendous echoes of what happened with [Barack] Obama,\u201d Coates says. \u201cIt was the fact that they were so successful that made them targets. I think the book tries to wrestle with that, in addition to my own experiences as a writer during the [Obama presidency].\u201d\n\nCoates is currently working on a script based on the New Yorker magazine piece \u201cWrong Answer,\u201d a school-cheating scandal that saw black teachers and administrators in Atlanta jailed.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do.

I didn't \u2014 and still don't \u2014 believe Spike had to end this epic and panoramic classic with a saccharine 90-second afterschool special. But it is also (arguably) its most effective. Because of the obvious emotional resonance of having a group of Black boys and girls say those words aloud on film. And also because it makes sense on both a macro (Malcolm X's legacy lives on) and a micro sense. Malcolm X wasn't just an everyman. He was literally every man. A poor kid, a pimp, a thief, a transplant, a porter, a prisoner, a bartender, a numbers runner, a preacher, a prophet; it was like he packed 12 different lives into 39 years of life.

And then he would have returned with a firehouse and sprayed the fuck out of everyone in it.\n\nActually, l misspoke. I'm certain some of these people do in fact realize that what they believe and what Dr. King believed are at two separate ends of the spectrum. Connecting themselves to him is just a transparently counterfeit way to pander politically and give themselves an \"I'm not racist\" alibi.

Specifically, Hollywood wunderkind Ryan Coogler is concerned about the artist, instructing him to zip up his coat.\n\nBut despite being one of the hottest writer-directors in the industry, Coogler is merely an observer tonight, having quietly sneaked onto the set to support younger brother Noah\u2014better known as rapper White Dave\u2014as he films the video for his most recent single, \u201cNervous.\u201d\n\nYoungest brother Keenan is also on hand; between takes, the three dance and clown with one another in the rainy streets. It\u2019s a rare glimpse at what the brothers may have been like as boys growing up in the Bay Area city of Richmond, Calif.\n\nIn fact, it was a childhood trope that prompted Ryan to rechristen the artist formerly known as Noah David as \u201cWhite Dave.\u201d Noah tells The Root: \u201cComing up, a lot of people used to try to discredit my blackness and discredit my \u2018down-ness,\u2019 because they said I talked \u2018white.\u2019 And it used to get under my skin a lot when I was younger.

The family\u2019s \u201cPerform well, play hard\u201d ethic was vital in keeping their three sons off the streets and on the straight and narrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow 26, Noah has a deeper appreciation for being sheltered from some grim realities. He says:\n\nThere was a lot of stuff going on in my neighborhood and in my city that I wasn\u2019t aware of, simply because my parents did their best to keep us out of it. I tell my parents \u201cthank you\u201d every day because they had three sons and raised them up in Richmond. I read a statistic that said 1 in 3 black boys raised in an urban environment end up either dead or in jail. I think my folks did a really good job, if that\u2019s the case. Richmond\u2019s a very violent city. And I remember\u2014I was in either sixth or seventh grade\u2014there was a football star from our city; his name was Terrance Kelly, from De La Salle [High School]. He had just signed to Oregon State; he was one of the biggest recruits in the country. Somebody shot and killed him while he was outside of his cousin\u2019s house. At that point, my parents were telling us how nobody\u2019s safe, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. Nobody cares who you are. He was kinda like a spokesman for the kids of Richmond. He was the one who was gonna get out and make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days, Richmond has another hometown hero in Ryan Coogler, whose recent trailer for Marvel\u2019s upcoming Black Panther movie not only left us collectively clamoring for its February 2018 release but also threatened to overshadow Game 4 of the NBA Finals altogether.\n\nBut despite his own success, big brother Ryan\u2014or \u201cDad No. 2,\u201d as Noah fondly calls him\u2014has a sincere interest in fostering his brother\u2019s career, too, giving him his first recording equipment, early placements on the Fruitvale Station and Creed soundtracks, and introducing him to publicist and manager Cali Green, who worked with the elder Coogler as an event producer on the #JusticeforFlint benefit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you meet [Noah], you root for him,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Noah, one clearly hears the passion for music that began when he was an 8- or 9-year-old spitting his first rhyme to an instrumental of Usher\u2019s \u201cMy Way\u201d and crafting early beats on a Casio keyboard given to him by his mother. \u201cI would race home, and every day after school and after practice, I\u2019d make a beat. \u2026 I made my first song when I was 12 years old,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time he reached high school, his beats were in demand by friends and area hip-hop artists alike, cementing his aspirations to become a producer. But his skills as a rapper were less well received\u2014a fact that never deterred him, in part because the situation echoed the trajectory of one of his idols, Kanye West. \u201cI remember he used to always talk about how no one gave him the shot at rapping, because he was a producer first. \u2026 When I first started, nobody was fuckin\u2019 with my shit, either. They was like, \u2018Your beats [are] tight, but you garbage.\u2019 But then, as I kept at it\u2014I kept grindin\u2019 and kept workin\u2019\u2014it all panned out,\u201d Noah says.\n\n\u201cPanned out\u201d may be an understatement, if Noah\u2019s recent work is any indication. In addition to the January release of The Season of the Rich, his recent credits include the title track for critically acclaimed independent film Kicks (starring Mahershala Ali and Kofi Siriboe, among others). Meanwhile, gaming enthusiasts might recognize his infectious single \u201cBands\u201d from hit video game \u201cNBA 2K17.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Noah\u2019s most popular to date, but like his mixtape, he considers it just a taste of his capabilities: \u201cFor me, getting music off is like a purge. That\u2019s what I made [The] Season of the Rich to be. I made it to be a compilation of songs that I want people to listen to, and get an overall feel of who I am and what I do. When I craft my first album, it\u2019ll be something that I craft from the ground up. An album should be an experience; it should be a feeling. It should be something that takes you to another level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoah predicts that that experience will eventually include an evolution beyond White Dave\u2014and rap\u2014into other genres. But in the immediate future, we can look forward to a more socially conscious sound, perhaps the type of awareness Noah hints at in his next single, \u201cHella.\u201d The track samples the iconic \u201cReturn of the Mack\u201d\u2014a Coogler childhood staple\u2014and recounts his return home after dropping out of Sacramento State a few years ago. Noah recalls:\n\n\n\nAt that time, I remember coming home\u2014my initial homecoming from college wasn\u2019t a warm one. It was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re taking this risk; I can\u2019t believe that you said fuck your future and you\u2019re gonna try this rap shit.\u201d It was tough for my parents to accept that decision that I\u2019d made. But what \u201cHella\u201d really represents is, it\u2019s a homecoming, but it\u2019s also\u2014it\u2019s an official proclamation that I\u2019m a rapper. Like, I\u2019m officially dropped out of school; there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s gonna hold me back from pursuing this dream that I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m officially an artist, this is what I\u2019m gonna do, and I\u2019m officially making that statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soon-to-be-released video was shot at his parents\u2019 home and features the Coogler clan\u2014minus Ryan, who refuses to distract from his brother\u2019s shine. Noah says, \u201cOne thing that was always awesome was the support that I received from them. They didn\u2019t necessarily like my decision, but they supported me nonetheless. And that\u2019s why I wanted to be sure that I included them in the video. Because everything ties together; and that\u2019s one of the overarching themes, is my relationship with my family.\u201d\n\nFor the Cooglers, it truly is a family affair. And while talented families aren\u2019t an anomaly in the entertainment business (see: the Knowles sisters, the Jacksons, etc.), Noah assures us that there is still more to come\u2014and not just from him: \u201cKeenan is really the one that everyone should watch out for, on the low.\u201d\n\nThe Season of the Rich is available on Spotify and Soundcloud; watch White Dave on YouTube, and follow him on social media @chillblanko.", "keywords": ["white", "dave", "rises", "ryan", "brother", "video", "used", "noah", "im", "coogler", "cooglers", "parents", "richmond", "thats"], "polarity": 0.0749002043061449, "subjectivity": 0.40323039446801817},

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates, have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based not only on its being the sole place on earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but it\u2019s also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, they are centuries ahead of anywhere else on earth. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders, and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this to Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities, and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So, if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets, and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther.\u201d) Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by the way of New York City.

For the first 32 years of its existence, the Black Panther\u2014created by Marvel Comics legends Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966\u2014had been written by whites. Christopher Priest and Hudlin, two very talented black writers, drastically changed the direction of the character when they took over his adventures in 1998 and 2005, respectively. Under their collective direction, the character\u2014the king and head priest of a Bast-worshipping, xenophobic African nation who had never been invaded by European colonialists\u2014was infused with an African-centered, self-determining ethos. In his run, Hudlin decided to shake up the Marvel fanbase by making the character a truly \u201cBlack\u201d Panther, an unapologetic African man openly opposed to white, Western supremacy.\n\n\n\nWith the Black Panther happily in vogue, I wanted to point out two important stories written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin, the former BET executive who made that Black Panther animated miniseries in 2010.\n\n\n\nThe first story is \u201cBlack to the Future,\u201d in the first-ever Panther annual published in 2008. The plot: in one possible future, Hudlin shows one of the Panther\u2019s and Storm\u2019s sons marrying the U.S. President, the daughter of former Avengers leader Luke Cage! This story, much of it told in flashback, answers an honest, real-world question: how did Wakanda escape being colonized without going to war against the entire Western world? The answer: the Wakandans made a pact with the white European colonial powers: if you don\u2019t make war on Wakanda, Wakandans will turn a blind eye to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonialism of the rest of Africa.\n\n\n\nThe story, which balanced Wakanda\u2019s past and possible future, seemed to be a return to the serious European colonization themes of Hudlin\u2019s first story arc, \u201cWho is the Black Panther?\u201d a story which he adapted to that cartoon (and has since been novelized).\n\n\n\nThe second of Hudlin\u2019s greatest Panther stories is one of the greatest Panther stories ever. It used the idea, first developed by Christopher J. Priest (the Panther\u2019s previous writer and Marvel\u2019s first Black editor), then furthered by Hudlin, that an ancestor Panther met Captain America in Wakanda during World War II!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, a 2010 mini-series drawn by Denys Cowan, the African-American artist who was one of the co-founders of Milestone Comics, expands on that story greatly. It tells a tale of white/Aryan racism and American militarism from the point of view of Gabriel Jones, the sole Black member of Sgt. Nick Fury\u2019s \u201cHowling Commandos\u201d U.S. Army Ranger squad. (This the same military unit Steve Rogers led in the first Captain America movie.)\n\n\n\nIn this story, Captain America and the Howling Commandos are sent to prod Wakanda to the side of the Allies in World War II. Azzuri, the Black Panther (T\u2019Challa\u2019s grandfather), tells the Americans that Wakanda will remain neutral. Meanwhile, the Red Skull and other Aryan supervillains under his command\u2014portrayed as unapologetic white supremacists and open racists\u2014attempt to invade Wakanda, wanting its vibranium.\n\n\n\n(Of course, America wants the vibranium, too; Fury tells Jones to spy for America and steal a sample.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, who is as impressed with Wakanda as Azzuri and the Wakandans are with him, has to decide whose side he will ultimately serve.\n\n\n\nAs a writer, Hudlin would not win any awards for subtlety. But looking at his complete body of Panther work, why he chose such a ham-fisted but potent approach was not hard to understand.\n\n\n\nHudlin clearly saw comic book writing not as a novel with pictures or a forum for deep psychological insights, but as a romp through the imagination, with the opportunity to strike pop satire notes and illustrate socio-political points. In a way, his approach was not that much different from (Panther creators) Stan Lee\u2019s and Jack Kirby\u2019s in the 1960s, before comic creators became enamored with literary pretentions. Also, Comics were not Hudlin\u2019s day job, so he could\u2014and did\u2014have fun.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of public reach, Hudlin made a much greater mark on the character than anyone before him combined.\n\n\n\nHudlin not only kept the character alive in a title, but because of the digital comic/animated series that aired on BET (with a small-but-important assist from the Panther\u2019s recurring appearances on Avengers: Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes, the animated series which aired on the Disney XD channel from 2010 to 2013), he singlehandedly made him Black America\u2019s best-known Black superhero not named Static or Blade. Black Americans who had never gone, and perhaps never would go, into a comic book shop now knew who the Black Panther was by name; they had seen or heard about the digital comic/animated mini-series that was sold in stores, aired on BET, and, as of 2018, is still available illegally somewhere online. The fact that the Panther was unapologetically Black in that mini-series significantly added to that popularity.\n\n\n\nThe filmmaker, a huge Black comic book fanboy, did the job he set out to do: he kept Panther\u2019s A-list standing among comic book fans while making him an A-lister in the 21st century Black popular imagination, right next to 20th and early 21st-century Black fantasy male icons like John Shaft, Hawk, and Blade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe turbo-charged Panther\u2019s coolness factor.\n\n\n\nHudlin acted in the tradition of Denny O\u2019Neil and Neal Adams\u2019s early 1970s Green Lantern/Green Arrow comic book title, in deftly combining bluntly socio-political content with action.\n\n\n\nAnd notably, with the creation (by Hudlin) of T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Princess Shuri, who grew into a strong, competent, grown-ass African woman warrior in her own right, he made the Panther title reflect Black feminism in a stronger way. No longer were Black women characters in Black Panther relegated to girlfriends/wives/fianc\u00e9es, kidnap victims, scorned women, sarcastic teenage sidekicks, or sexy, mostly silent bodyguards.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil T\u2019Challa\u2019s film debut in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War, it was Hudlin\u2019s (animated) Panther that was the one most non-comic book-reading Black people knew about.\n\nCopyright 2018 by Diasporic Africa Press.\n\n", "keywords": ["reginald", "comic", "wakanda", "hudlin", "movie", "america", "marvel", "war", "black", "character", "partly", "panther", "book", "panthers"], "polarity": 0.09702287946428571, "subjectivity": 0.4092819940476186},

At the end of the season, the 49ers let Kaepernick, his perfect Afro and all his pro-blackness go. Since being released, Kaepernick has vowed that he has no intention of protesting this upcoming season, but still no offers.\n\nRecently, Spike Lee and his sweet Malcolm X cap met up with Kaepernick, which led to this Instagram post:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Spike is right. Look\u2014Kaepernick isn\u2019t the best quarterback, by any means, but acting as if he can\u2019t play in this league, or couldn\u2019t bring value to a team, is ridiculous. He\u2019s sitting on the free agent market for one reason and one reason alone: He\u2019s a black man who protested about black issues, and that makes white America uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be super clear about this: If his talent outweighed his protest, no one would care. The NFL has made a habit of offering second chances to domestic abusers, men who have been accused of murder, men who savagely beat their children, and men who\u2019ve been arrested for various felonies, including drunk driving and assault. But standing up for black rights is a just a little too taboo for the NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Kaepernick doesn\u2019t find a football home, then we\u2019ll all know what this is about: NFL owners are too afraid to take on a player who could actually help their team win\u2014not because he\u2019s a deplorable person, but because he had the audacity to stand up for black rights during a sacred NFL game. Doesn\u2019t matter that he was trying to bring attention to the police killings of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Keith Lamont Scott and countless others who lost their lives in confrontations with the pistols of America\u2019s racism.\n\nIn fact, in 2016, more than 250 black people were killed by police; but let\u2019s not get upset with this statistic\u2014which was all that Kaepernick was trying to use his platform to bring attention to. Let\u2019s keep acting as if Kaepernick isn\u2019t better than your team\u2019s backup quarterback. Let\u2019s keep acting as if Kaepernick\u2019s quarterbacking, and not his Afro or his passion for the Movement for Black Lives, is the reason he\u2019s jobless. Let\u2019s act as if an organization couldn\u2019t use some of the good public relations that Kaepernick brings, like his offseason work with underprivileged children or his huge donations to charities or his efforts to feed starving Somalians.\n\nLet\u2019s all pretend that the underlying reason for why Kaepernick hasn\u2019t been called for a new job isn\u2019t that he has an amazing Afro that harks back to a time when players stood up for what they believed. The NFL is historically racist. In fact, I can\u2019t even type my hometown team\u2019s name (a team that could surely use Kaepernick) because it\u2019s a racial slur.

We don\u2019t know how long he would have lived had he not been assassinated 50 years ago on Feb. 21, 1965, on the stage of the Audubon Ballroom at Broadway and West 165th Street in New York City. We just know that he was taken from us far too soon. Still, his intense, bespectacled gaze, forefinger resting against his face, remains the prevailing emblem of black rage and resistance. That his legacy has reverberated for decades without the stamp of approval from the U.S. government, without being taught in schools or quoted in Christian churches on Sunday mornings, speaks to the sheer magnitude of the man and the undeniable truth in his message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalcolm didn\u2019t tiptoe around diagnosing the illness of white supremacy or pointing out its symptoms in the form of religious terrorism and police brutality. He boldly declared that systemic racism is not baseless conjecture; rather, it is a deeply embedded statement of fact that provides the framework for the United States of America.\n\nMalcolm X loved black people and hated structural whiteness. Today, as dead black bodies continue to fall in U.S. streets from Ohio to New York, a booming prison-industrial complex continues to scour street corners for prey and a corrupt political system continues to placate black citizens with a blurry carbon copy of equality, his words in a 1964 letter to the Egyptian Gazette still ring true:\n\nWe can never get civil rights in America until our human rights are first restored. We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as humans. \u2026 The American \u201csystem\u201d (political, economic and social) was produced from the enslavement of the black man, and this present \u201csystem\u201d is capable only of perpetuating that enslavement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is often said that revolution is for the young; this was true of Malcolm. Though he looms larger than life, he was 27 years old when he began preaching at Muhammad\u2019s Temple No. 7 in Harlem and only 39 years old when at least seven bullets left him gasping for his final breaths mere moments after greeting a crowd with \u201cAs-Salaam-Alaikum.\u201d\n\nPeace be unto you.\n\nAnd when he said peace, he also meant freedom because he taught us that there is no way to be at peace without it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his riveting and iconic eulogy, activist and actor Ossie Davis declared Malcolm to be our \u201cshining black prince.\u201d What is less often quoted is that Davis also said that Harlem\u2019s black community\u2014\u201cbeleaguered, unfortunate, but nonetheless proud\u201d\u2014had never had a \u201cbraver, more gallant, young champion\u201d than Malcolm X. And it is that same bravery that propels a movement from city to city today.\n\nMany of us know the myth and the legend of Malcolm X. Here, The Root takes a look at the young man in action, putting on for his city and for his people, in these rarely seen clips.\n\n1. Malcolm X \u201cCity Desk\u201d interview, March 17, 1963:\n\nHere\u2019s Malcolm X on slavery stealing black identity as well as the enrollment of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi: \u201cIt\u2019s a farce; it\u2019s hypocrisy. Because if it\u2019s right for one Negro to be forced into that university then every Negro in the state of Mississippi who is qualified has the same right to go to that university. And if the government is not ready and willing to enforce the right of every Negro in the state of Mississippi, then it\u2019s only hypocrisy to pretend they are for justice by pushing one Negro in and blowing it up all over the world to make it look like they\u2019re solving the problem when millions of black people in that state are going to segregated schools and getting an inferior education.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Malcolm X during an undated ABC interview on the importance of being black:\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018Negro\u2019 is a term that was made up by the white man himself during slavery. No right-thinking black man in America will accept it as a term to apply to himself. If the white man, no matter how dark he gets, still regards himself as a white man, then our people, no matter how light we get, still regard ourselves as black people. If it\u2019s good enough for them to be white, then it\u2019s better for us to be black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Malcolm X speaks in Los Angeles on May 5, 1962, at the memorial service for Ronald Stokes, an NOI member killed by the Los Angeles Police Department:\n\n\u201c[Black people] should shock the white man by working together in unity. Despite religious, political, economic, or educational or social differences. Let us remember that we\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Baptist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Methodist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Muslims. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Catholic. We\u2019re brutalized because we\u2019re black people in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis speech is also when Malcolm asked the powerful, rhetorical question: \u201cWho taught you to hate yourself?\u201d\n\n4. Malcolm X debates civil rights leader and March on Washington architect Bayard Rustin on the need for self-determination for black America:\n\n\u201cToday the black man, according to the government economist, has spending power of $20 billion per year. We feel that with the black man spending $20 billion per year, not creating any businesses, not creating any industry, not creating any job opportunities for his own kind, he\u2019s not in a moral position to point the finger at the white man and say that he\u2019s discriminating against him for not giving him a job in factories that he himself set up. If the black man has $20 billion and these so-called Negroes are such geniuses that they can integrate white restaurants and white factories and force themselves into that which the white man has set up, they should use that same ingenuity to show the black people how to pool our wealth and set up something of our own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to Rustin\u2019s criticism of the NOI for organizing in the streets of Harlem, Malcolm responded, \u201cYou can reach more people in the street who want to change than you can in the bourgeoisie society, the bourgeoisie church and the bourgeoisie circles.\u201d\n\n5. Malcolm X on voting:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest that they vote for any party or either party. I would suggest that the so-called Negroes become politically mature, realize the power that they hold in the field of politics. Once the person realizes that the Negro is awakened to the power that he holds, then that person will approach that Negro on a more intelligent plane. As it is right now, most of the Negro leaders sell out to the white politicians for crumbs, and a political awakening among Negroes will make it impossible for the present Negro leaders to sell our people out as they\u2019ve been doing in the past.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "negro", "icons", "man", "ring", "matters", "brutalized", "words", "black", "x", "true", "political", "right", "city", "malcolm"], "polarity": 0.050913260237030716, "subjectivity": 0.42686022993400013},

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was five years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and now, her transparency.

Although his father was not a royal, Musa was appointed a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the empire and assumed the throne in 1312 when the previous king took a pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return.\n\nWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali. Instead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation as he used his control of gold and salts to connect disparate city-states into one empire. It is said that by the end of his life, it would have taken an entire year to go from one end of the Mali empire to the other.\n\nBecause of this, Mansa earned more titles than a Game of Thrones character. He was called Emir of Melle, Lord of the Mines of Wangara, Conqueror of Ghanata, Lion of Mali. The only titles he never earned were Mother of Dragons and King of the North. At its height, scholars say, the kingdom had 400 densely populated cities in the Niger Delta. The University of Sankore in Timbuktu, Mali, still stands where he built it after conquering the area.\n\nWestern Europe was basically the PJs, and Mansa Musa\u2019s West African empire was the deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his immense wealth and power, very few outside of Africa knew of Mansa until his pilgrimage. Most accounts say that he took 60,000 men on his trip with him and balled out along the way, much to white people\u2019s dismay.\n\nNever one to be stingy with his money, Musa is reported to have handed out gold bars to poor people along his travel route. Almost every version of his hajj tells the same story: King Musa handed out so much gold to the poor, it actually collapsed the entire gold market in the Middle East! To use the academic terms of macroeconomics, Mansa made it rain so much in da\u2019 club, everyone else in the world look broke by comparison!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did he do to fix this?\n\nIn perhaps the greatest money move ever made, the king borrowed all of the gold his crew could carry from Cairo. Of course he didn\u2019t need it, but the scarcity of the precious metal settled the market. Then, like the baller he was, he simply repaid the Egyptian moneylenders back, plus interest.\n\nI\u2019m sure he also included a note that said: \u201cMy bad. I\u2019m not used to hanging out with broke people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Mali, Musa brought back some of Spain\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s most prized architects and builders, creating an even wealthier kingdom. Historians say that by the time he returned from Mecca, he controlled most of the gold and salt in the Mediterranean. Coincidentally, this is when the kingdom of Mali began showing up on European maps.\n\nSo when you\u2019re fantasizing about a fictional African kingdom of untold fortune, remember that there was once a real king who could probably have lent T\u2019Challa a few dollars until Wakanda\u2019s vibranium check cleared the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow and when Mansa Musa died is a topic of fierce debate, but in our extensive research, we could not determine whether Mansa Musa released his tax returns. We could, however, confirm that even after the death of Mansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.", "keywords": ["real", "gold", "wakanda", "musa", "europe", "wealth", "kingdom", "african", "king", "empire", "mansa", "mali"], "polarity": 0.1177283105022831, "subjectivity": 0.409336812350511},

And then I Googled \u201cWakanda ticket prices,\u201d as if the country were real.\n\n\n\nThe short review is: Black Panther is a thing of cinematic black excellence, and the world just has to deal. It\u2019s everything you want it to be and more. I\u2019m still hype, and I screened this movie Jan. 30 and kept my mouth shut about details all this time! I think I deserve an award.\n\nI am going to try my best to wrap up my bubbling emotions (yes, still bubbling) into a cute little package for you all, just to tell you what you already know: Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther is powerful enough to shift the planet. It\u2019s like Coogler grabbed everything black people talk about in barbershops, church, kitchens, cookouts and group texts and wrapped it in Wakanda magic.\n\nImagine living in a northeastern country in Africa and having the entire world see you as a developing nation, but you\u2019re literally sitting on a gold (vibranium) mine. If you\u2019re triggered, it\u2019s because, throughout this mystifying film, Coogler reminds you of how close the themes are to what\u2019s happening or has happened in the world around us. The entire continent of Africa is often perceived as developing, when, in reality, it\u2019s a rich land of kings and queens.\n\nWakanda (much like another fan favorite with a nod to the Motherland, Coming to America\u2019s Zamunda) shows off its royalty through elaborate and blatant displays. Black Panther has a strong focus on legacy\u2014who gets to be a part of it, how far a king would go to protect his country\u2014but it also explores how the entire world changes because of an unexpected shakeup of political power (cough\u2014Donald Trump\u2014cough).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe that delivers a superhero story with heart, soul and rhythm. Black Panther confronts the conflict of being a wealthy nation refusing to disturb itself by helping the rest of the ailing world.\n\nYou can see immediately that the \u201cgood guy,\u201d T\u2019Challa, operates in a gray area. His choices are political and often clouded by his drive to protect his people. And even though the film is named for his superhero namesake and T\u2019Challa is one of the most complicated of heroes, Chadwick Boseman plays it in a way that makes room for his star-studded ensemble cast to shine bright.\n\n\n\nAnd no one shines like T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright). Wright is what Tiffany Haddish was to Girls Trip. Her hilarious one-liners from \u201cwhatter thooooosssee\u201d to \u201ccolonizer\u201d will have you wishing she was in every scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright\u2019s Shuri works in the tech lab in the Wakanda kingdom. She\u2019s in charge of all things Black Panther. She rebels against the poised nature found in royal bloodlines and wins you over with her espressolike spunk, quick wit and mind-shattering tech talents. Shuri is a beacon for little black girls who may have been called nerds as if that were a bad thing. Watching Shuri bounce around her lab, decorated in funky paintings, walls vibrating with music, is like sharing dreams in color of all the young black girls who code.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther delivers a message of power in many forms to young black girls. Every female character in this film has an arc that makes her live long after the credits roll. Okoye (Danai Gurira) is a stunning character, but Gurira\u2019s portrayal of her makes me want to be a soldier\u2014not for America, of course\u2014for Wakanda. The Dora Milaje is a group of female soldiers devoted to T\u2019Challa\u2019s protection; they believe in their country over everything.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil it for you, but the fight scenes in which the Dora Milaje are featured will have you signing up for all kinds of self-defense courses. But it\u2019s Okoye and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) who are the Beyonc\u00e9s of combat. As the leader of the Dora Milaje and a war dog, respectively, these women showcase a quiet inner and outer strength you\u2019d want the entire movie wrapped around. And it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are the stars here. From Okoye snatching off her own wig to Nakia using her heel as a weapon, there\u2019s no denying this ode to black women.\n\n\u201cStand up. You are a king,\u201d Ramonda (Angela Bassett) shouts at son T\u2019Challa during a battle for the throne. \u201cShow them who you are.\u201d\n\nThese may have been encouraging words for T\u2019Challa to dig in and fight harder, but they sank in for me. Black Panther was a full-on love letter to the Motherland, but there were also several smaller love notes to blackness throughout. Whether they were the cheers from Ramonda, or Nakia\u2019s Bantu knots, or the Wakanda dignitaries with lip plates, or Wakandans speaking isiXhosa, a South African language known for its tongue clicks, there was more than enough evidence of the appreciation and adoration for all things black in this film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Black Panther\u2019s villain, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is someone to be proud of. Coogler uses him as a means to explore identity, legacy and Diasporic blackness.\n\nJordan\u2019s Killmonger just might be the best villain I\u2019ve seen since Heath Ledger\u2019s the Joker. You immediately think Marvel villain Ulysses Klaue is going to be who T\u2019Challa is up against, but Killmonger shuts that down quickly.\n\nKillmonger is undoubtedly scary and will end your life without a first, second or third thought, but his heart is actually in the right place. He wants to fight for the black people who are left in America\u2019s poverty and need just a taste of the riches Wakanda offers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s the scariest villain because Killmonger actually believes in what he\u2019s doing, and, honestly, so will you. He\u2019s an advocate for black people outside of Wakanda. But we all know, black or white, Wakanda doesn\u2019t do outsiders. Without saying too much, sometimes it be your own people.\n\nKillmonger doesn\u2019t want to take Wakanda down. He wants everyone to have a piece of the kingdom\u2019s glory and is determined to make it happen by any means necessary\u2014even if that means taking down T\u2019Challa.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Michael B. Jordan is one of Ryan Coogler\u2019s go-to stars. His range and depth are awe-inspiring. At one point, Killmonger shifts your entire morality by saying, \u201cBury me where my ancestors jumped from ships because death was better than bondage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoogler\u2019s genius can be seen and felt the entire time you\u2019re sitting there, thrown smack-dab into Wakanda. I get antsy after about an hour and a half during movies, but Black Panther held my attention far longer.\n\nLet\u2019s all do what we can to make sure Ryan Coogler stays protected because we need his genius. We need his storytelling and his ability to make T\u2019Challa and all of Wakanda jump off the comic book page with so much seasoning, I don\u2019t think we even deserve it.\n\nThis movie is the epitome of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d Black Panther is an entire body raised in goosebumps. It\u2019s a ride I wasn\u2019t ready for, but would gladly ride over and over again. I already know I\u2019m going to see this movie at least three more times. It\u2019s the same reason Black Panther\u2019s presale tickets have already outpaced those of any other superhero movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s about time we get to see our people in a movie like this. And this is only the beginning. We should all experience Black Panther.\n\n", "keywords": ["shuri", "biggest", "wakanda", "movie", "delivers", "blackest", "world", "superhero", "black", "good", "panther", "tchalla", "villain", "killmonger", "entire"], "polarity": 0.0943629029372831, "subjectivity": 0.4756165551620095},

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["designers", "fashion", "talent", "missing", "hiring", "problem", "black", "industry", "simply", "designer", "chasemarshall", "action"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates, have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based not only on its being the sole place on earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but it\u2019s also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, they are centuries ahead of anywhere else on earth. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders, and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this to Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities, and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So, if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets, and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther.\u201d) Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by the way of New York City.

Never clothes.\n\nTGU: Who\u2019s your muse?\n\nMP: When I design, I imagine a woman who has a strong sense of self; someone who isn\u2019t interested in labels or monograms.

She is a leader\u2014a disruptive woman, who understands that her wardrobe is a reflection of her and not the collective society.

Yes, there are amazing musical numbers. Yes, Michael Jackson danced and sang his ass off. Still, this hot garbage is hardly watchable. The narrative will put you to sleep faster than a Benadryl downed with a glass of red wine, and the acting is aggressively bad. Like, DMX in Belly kind of bad. Diana Ross killed the singing, though. Too bad they asked her to act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would wager that most people fast forward through the story and only watch the musical numbers and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re losing at life.\n\nHB#2: The Color Purple\n\nThis movie has great acting, great direction, and brilliant source material. My only beef is that Steven Spielberg is the director. I guess they could not find someone black to put behind the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t care how many times you quote the film or how much your big mama watched it, if someone black ain\u2019t in the directing chair, I\u2019m not considering it a great black film.\n\nHB #3: Coming to America\n\nSee HB 2. No black director. I refuse to consider it a great black film.\n\nHB #4: Hidden Colors\n\nThis is what you watch at the beginning of Hotep basic training. It purports to give insight about the lost history of black people in America, and even if I were able to turn off my philosophical mind, I\u2019d still find some of the information difficult to believe. Further, the director is a noted misogynist and, just being honest, the film\u2019s production values are laughable. This movie is so laced with Hotepism that I needed a bottle of lotion for my ashy ankles after watching it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHB#5: She\u2019s Gotta Have It\n\nSpike Lee\u2019s first film is aiight. He tries to elevate the material by shooting it in black and white, but the gender politics are antiquated and the acting is mediocre at best. It\u2019s Spike\u2019s first film, and I can tell.\n\nHB#6: Every single Tyler Perry film (except Daddy\u2019s Little Girls) and ESPECIALLY Temptation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not even going to dignify these films with a thoughtful analysis.\n\nHB #7: Lean On Me\n\nThis film is beloved by black grandfathers everywhere because it is a two-hour meditation on patriarchy and respectability politics. Joe Clark begins the film by expelling 300 students, and then begins to treat educators and students alike in a condescending and infantile manner. Oh yeah, a white dude directed this film as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Fair Eastside\u2019 was dope, tho.\n\nHB#8: All the sequels to Friday\n\nYou know those movies aren\u2019t funny. You ain\u2019t gotta lie to kick it.\n\nHB #9: New Jack City\n\nThis film has not aged well. The haircuts are laughably bad, the dialogue is VERY bad (Ice-T actually says, \u201cI want to shoot you so bad my dick is hard\u201d), and the acting is worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNino Brown is a cartoonish villain (Did he really put crack in the Thanksgiving turkey?) and the film does not deal with the way housing discrimination and poverty played a role in the explosion of violence in the 1990s. This film is essentially a commercial for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. I\u2019m pretty sure Hilary got the idea of Super Predators watching this movie.\n\nHB#10: Baby Boy\n\nWith the exception of Four Brothers, John Singleton has been making nonsense since 1997, and that\u2019s too bad\u2014he started with such promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyz N The Hood is a black coming of age masterpiece; Poetic Justice is a ghettoized take on a road movie, and both Higher Learning and Rosewood are essential, tragic films. It all started going downhill when he made Baby Boy\u2014and I can see why.\n\nThis is an indulgent film. It tries to be a coming of age tale for a grown ass man, a comedy, a tense, urban drama, and a love story all at once\u2014while failing on all fronts. The direction is sloppy; the editing haphazard, and the acting is so bad that Gary Coleman would be offended. Snoop Dogg is supposed to be a threatening presence, but his arms look so emaciated in the scene with an undershirt that it made me wonder if he would have the strength necessary to pull a trigger if the narrative called for it.\n\nSingleton thinks he is insightful in the critiques of black men as careless fathers, but he merely showcases respectability politics and patriarchy in how the narrative is resolved. The film lacks the insight of Boyz in explicating how institutional racism plays a role in the failure of some black men to play an active role in the lives of their children, and, ultimately, the film calls for men to grow up and be the heads of their households without showing the barriers that could preclude such a happy ending from taking place. Essentially, according to this movie, black men need to pull up their pants, get a job, and take care of their families. But what happens if race keeps you from making a living, saving wage?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure folks will be coming for my black card or calling my place of employment demanding that I no longer teach classes on black films.

However, Oprah, Atlanta and MLK are all known properties, but aside from a few commercials, most of black America really doesn\u2019t know that much about Black Panther. The unofficial \u201cAsk a Black Person on the Street\u201d poll question, \u201cWho is Black Panther?\u201d received the following answers:\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s the black guy in a cat suit, right? Thurgood Marshall? Isn\u2019t he from Wakdanda, which is like the gentrified suburbs of Zamunda? I heard about him; Umar Johnson got bit by a radioactive panther and now he fights crime?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the way, 100 percent of those people are going to see the movie and dropped cash into a GoFundMe, too. Fortunately, there\u2019s a great way to up your Panther game over the next month courtesy of someone from our very own Gizmodo family.\n\nWriting genius Evan Narcisse, who writes about comics and comic reviews at io9, is now writing the Rise of Black Panther limited series for Marvel comics. The comic covers the early years of T\u2019Challa as Black Panther, as well as his family history and nation. Consider it like a Fodor\u2019s for Wakanda.\n\nThe book is exciting, well-written and a great jumping-on point for anybody of any age who wants to know more about the character. The Root talked to Narcisse about what it was like to write the most popular black hero ever, and whether superhero-ing really comes from your mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: So how did this whole Black Panther thing get started? You\u2019ve been writing about comics at io9 for years, but how did you go from doing interviews with Ta-Nehisi Coates about Black Panther to writing an origin book for his main title?\n\nEvan Narcisse: I\u2019d see him [Coates] around, not terribly often, but when he got the Black Panther gig I was basically like, \u201cSON,\u201d and he was like, \u201cSON, I KNOW!!!\u201d [Laughs.] \u2026. So, because he was my friend and I was, like, writing [for io9], I never, like, reviewed the book or anything. I did some interviews with him before the book came out, and his editor Will Moss at Marvel was like, \u201cHe [Narcisse] really knows his stuff. Do you think he\u2019d be interested in writing some comics?\u201d\n\nOver the years of writing about comics, people have asked me that, but I had a sense about how people got paid, and I just never wanted to take that chance. Coates had sort of suggested that as well: You should do comics. Then, basically a year-and-a-half ago, I get this text from Coates\u2014and he\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s not even coming from me, it\u2019s from Will [ Moss] my editor.\u201d And that\u2019s how it started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNarcisse pitched the idea of a \u201cBlack Panther: Year One\u201d story, to learn about what makes T\u2019Challa a man, a king and an African superhero in a world filled with blond-haired superpatriots and golden-locked gods. But Narcisse didn\u2019t just want to do a straight adventure story. T\u2019Challa has a lineage, his mother dies, his father is killed, he\u2019s raised by a single mom; Narcisse wanted all of that in the story.\n\n\n\nEN: It always bothered me that we never knew anything about N\u2019Yami [T\u2019Challa\u2019s mother]. There\u2019s a trope in comic books and pop culture\u2014the ghost wife or the ghost mom\u2014because parental death is a real plot point that happens over and over again, and I wanted to make her a real person. I thought about my own daughter, who is an avid reader. She gets those genes from me. And I thought about this child [T\u2019Challa] who\u2019s a scientist and you never see that in his father, so I think maybe he got that from his mother; maybe she helped usher in the golden age of technological development for Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the first issue alone, Narcisse lays out how it was T\u2019Challa\u2019s mother, N\u2019Yami, and her brilliance that helped keep Wakanda strong and safe from outside imperialist forces. You can totally understand how a nation\u2019s fiercest warriors are women when you see the power that N\u2019yami wields in the comic. The intimate relationship she has with T\u2019Chaka, the previous Black Panther and T\u2019Challa\u2019s father, is beautifully tragic as well.\n\n\n\nThe best part of Narcisse\u2019s Rise of Black Panther is you get to see the early stages of the hero\u2019s career. If you read Coates\u2019 monthly Black Panther comic, you see a guy in full control of his nation and powers. In the Black Panther movie by Marvel next month, you\u2019ll see a fully formed hero who\u2019s just stepping into his power as king.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRise of the Black Panther gives you a young man still exploring the world. His birth mother is dead, his father has been killed by an outsider, he\u2019s a prince who\u2019s been locked away in an isolated xenophobic nation where everyone caters to his needs, and now he wants to see what\u2019s out there. Imagine Jaden Smith going off to college but with superpowers. I asked Narcisse how those dynamics play out in the first issue of the comic.\n\nEN: T\u2019Challa is a man who has multiple vectors of desire pulling at him. He wants to explore the unknown. And innovate and create. He\u2019s also a son who will never stop mourning his father. He was raised by a single mother. But he\u2019s also somebody that looks at the outsider world as something to unlock. Some of it is to Wakanda\u2019s advantage.\n\nI see T\u2019Challa as someone with a massive amount of innate curiosity. He\u2019s asking himself, \u201cI wonder what sauerkraut tastes like? I wonder how other people raise their families and their relationships?\u201d There\u2019s a Wakanda way of doing things and everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to satisfy your Black Panther thirst between now and February, you can\u2019t do better than to pick up the first issue of Rise of Black Panther, which you can grab at your local comic shop or buy digitally online.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a fun read and gives you a great story and some background you won\u2019t get anywhere else. Also, you don\u2019t want to be in line for the movie on Feb. 16 thinking that Black Panther is the Falcon\u2019s twin brother.", "keywords": ["comic", "writing", "evan", "father", "went", "black", "mother", "rise", "comics", "narcisse", "tchalla", "panther", "hes", "io9s"], "polarity": 0.11736331001472759, "subjectivity": 0.42662002945508093},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

At the tender age of 32, this year has marked his sixth at the helm of the French luxury label, and it was his biggest to date. Since June, Rousteing has overseen the opening of a Beverly Hills, Calif., flagship boutique, a collaboration with Victoria\u2019s Secret for its annual runway show, the launch of now-sold-out designs for Beats by Dre and even costumes for the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nBut one of Rousteing\u2019s lowest-profile collaborations is also one of his most accessible, and with Christmas gifts now bought and opened, \u2019tis the time in the season to treat yourself.\n\nIn Balmain\u2019s first venture into beauty, it recently teamed up with fellow French classic L\u2019Oreal Paris to create a Color Riche capsule collection of 12 of-the-moment matte shades, including a classic red aptly named \u201cDomination,\u201d a metallic army green labeled \u201cBalmain Instinct\u201d and a brown called \u201cPower\u201d that reminds us of the beloved \u201cBrazil Nut\u201d we rocked in high school. There\u2019s even an ultraviolet, perfectly on trend with Pantone\u2019s Color of the Year, called \u201cFreedom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve yet to forget\u2014or forgive\u2014L\u2019Oreal Paris U.K.\u2019s recent dismissal of model Munroe Bergdorf over her very accurate comments about race, our fandom of Rousteing\u2014the only black person to head a major fashion house and the youngest creative director in Paris since Yves Saint Laurent\u2014definitely has us thinking twice. He, too, has been outspoken about racism, especially within the fashion industry, as he told Out magazine:\n\nLook at perfume campaigns. You never see black girls, and if you do, they use Photoshop so much that they almost look white. It\u2019s just wrong. People post on my Instagram that they are so happy to see black boys and black girls. I\u2019m happy that they see it and don\u2019t think that fashion belongs to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL\u2019Oreal seems to have taken the hint, too, making sure to show even the palest shades in this collection on dark skin.\n\nAnd while you won\u2019t find this collection at your local drugstore, you will find it at the relatively bargain price of $14 per shade, even at luxury retailers like Barneys New York.

But we now know this was how he intended it. Spike Lee\u2019s recent documentary about Jackson\u2019s early years features a letter Jackson wrote in 1979, at age 21. He had just released Off the Wall and was on the Destiny tour with his brothers, an experience that only strengthened his resolve to shed like a chrysalis \u201cthe kid who sang \u2018ABC\u2019 and \u2018I Want You Back\u2019\u201d and emerge as \u201ca new incredible actor, singer, dancer that will shock the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do no interviews,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will be magic. I will be a perfectionist, a researcher, a trainer, a masterer. \u2026 I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it, take it steps further from where the greatest left off.\u201d\n\nThere is so much to say about this that we may as well start with the obvious: \u201cmasterer.\u201d The neologism doubles down on mastery, as if to \u201cmaster\u201d one\u2019s craft were too modest an aim. A master conquers one domain, whereas a \u201cmasterer\u201d presumably dominates several, mastering mastery itself. Of course, Jackson\u2019s outsize ambition would need its own outsize word.\n\nLee\u2019s film spotlights the work ambition required and, in so doing, rejects the myth of black artists as \u201cnaturals.\u201d A far cry from the child prodigy who simply cashed in on his God-given talent, Jackson painstakingly nurtured his gifts. Kobe Bryant says that Jackson told him he would dance until he could no longer move; Valerie Simpson and Quincy Jones both describe his desire to learn everything about the art and industry of music, whether at Motown or on the set of The Wiz, where he stood \u201cat attention\u201d and memorized everyone\u2019s part.\n\nPart of his aesthetic was to expose that work, emitting the grunts and hollers that the black vocal tradition has long announced instead of masking. But his genius was to master and merge the athleticism of the \u201chardest-working man in show business,\u201d James Brown, whom he idolized, with the grace of Fred Astaire, the Nicholas Brothers and Diana Ross. With Jackson, you got both the sweat of the brow and the tips of the toes, the grunts and the \u201cwoos\u201d sent up like fireworks. That\u2019s why the moonwalk is his signature move: You know it\u2019s hard, but it looks effortless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, however, his art was not unlike American puritanism, which glorifies hard work as the key to success while maintaining a scrupulous silence about overwork. For Jackson, the task of staying musically current and socially responsive while managing global celebrity and infamy\u2014he was constantly featured in tabloid accounts such as the one that circulated this week, about his alleged \u201cstockpile\u201d of child pornography\u2014was too much. His face was the first sign, its surgical modifications betraying the excess of \u201cwork\u201d performed not by but on him. His spectacular performing body kept a secret that his immobile face revealed: This is what it looks like to be overworked.\n\nWhatever his feelings about his black face, he was a tireless student of black music, which gave him many ways to \u201cwork through\u201d pain and myriad styles to master. \u201cWill You Be There\u201d takes refuge in gospel\u2014churchy ad libs, modulations, allusion to the River Jordan\u2014while reappropriating the gospel choir then in vogue among white artists like George Michael (\"Father Figure\") and Madonna (\"Like a Prayer\"). Jackson\u2019s song wasn\u2019t \u201clike a prayer\u201d; its outro was a prayer. \"They Don\u2019t Care About Us\" presses hard-driving funk into the service of global black rage and resistance. In case anyone missed the song\u2019s racial component, Jackson enlisted Spike Lee, who had just filmed Malcolm X, to direct not one, but two videos for it.\n\nBut Jackson\u2019s last studio album was different. He invested four years and $30 million into Invincible, recording 50 tracks, from which he selected 16, and hiring an army of co-writers and producers that included Rodney Jerkins, Teddy Riley, Babyface and Marsha Ambrosius. But the album was as chill as an artist with \u201cno chill\u201d could be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it proved that Jackson could master hip-hop soul, it also presented a vibrant review of his work across three decades as the hardest-working magician in show business. Here\u2019s a defiant address to the haters in the tradition of \"Leave Me Alone\" (\"Unbreakable\"); here\u2019s a song about femme fatales like \"Billie Jean\" and \"Dirty Diana\" (\"Heartbreaker\"); a paean to childhood innocence like \"Heal the World\" (\"The Lost Children\"); and a quiet-storm neo-soul ballad, \"Butterflies,\" that was his most sensual love song since \"Human Nature.\"\n\n\"You Rock My World\" was the highlight, with its swirling synths and elastic dance beat. Even the opening skit was fun. Chris Tucker bets Jackson \u201cNever-never-land\u201d that he can\u2019t get a fine woman, recalling the easy black male camaraderie in the video for \"Jam,\" where Jackson misses jump shots while Michael Jordan tries to dance. Just as the \"Thriller\" video had combined multiple horror subgenres (teen werewolf, zombie apocalypse), the video for \"Rock My World\" rolled about five classic M.J. videos into one.\n\nWearing a dark suit, red shirt and a fedora that covered his distracting face, Jackson danced through a dimly lit, mob-run club in a grown-and-sexy version of \"The Way You Make Me Feel\"\u2014more mating dance with a beautiful woman (Kishaya Dudley) than stalker\u2019s pursuit of her. Here, too, was the gangster conceit of \"Smooth Criminal\"; the crew of professional dancers that Jackson had made a staple of the music video since the \u201980s; and a storyline, as in \"Beat It\" and \"Remember the Time,\" in which Jackson and his friends danced for their lives. Did he deploy these devices like a tried-and-true formula for success? You bet.

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates, have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based not only on its being the sole place on earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but it\u2019s also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, they are centuries ahead of anywhere else on earth. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders, and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this to Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities, and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So, if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets, and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther.\u201d) Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by the way of New York City.

The occasion was the annual Black Comic Book Festival\u2014an event that draws thousands of comic enthusiasts, creators, publishers and collectors. Black Panther tickets had just gone on sale days before, and an evening event at the festival promised advanced clips from the film. But the Marvel film was, in many ways, old news to some of the attendees.\n\nThey were there to commune with one another, promote their stories, explore new stories and revel in a space that was wholly theirs.\n\nLining the halls were comic book heads of all levels\u2014the devout, with decades of reading under their belt; others who were in their nascency; and kids curious about the characters in costumes lining the vendor tables. At a Black Characters Matter panel, Stacey Robinson, an artist and Arthur Schomburg fellow, spoke in the Langston Hughes Auditorium about his art. How, through it, he transforms the gallery spaces containing his pieces\u2014areas that have long excluded black people as creators and audience\u2014into spaces where black liberation was foregrounded, if only temporarily.\n\n\n\nRobinson spoke to the audience about the need to \u201cdefine our blackness instead of responding to our colonial situation.\u201d By putting work centering black life in historically white spaces, Robinson said that he aimed to \u201ctransform the original concept of that space.\u201d\n\nJust days before, Black Panther broke yet another barrier: The film had smashed the presale records for the Marvel Comics Universe, the most lucrative film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListening to Robinson, it was hard not to consider the anticipation for Black Panther against what American theaters have historically been: segregated spaces largely unconcerned with depicting black life. Now, in the days leading up to Black Panther\u2019s official release, the biggest story in cinema right now is about a black utopian space\u2014Wakanda.\n\n\n\nBack in January, the early numbers assigned a quantitative value to the anticipation many had felt for months. During a news cycle that felt frequently dystopic, the pull of a true black utopian space, whether it be the fictional Wakanda or the community of enthralled movie theatergoers immersing themselves in it, was real.\n\nBlack Panther offers up a singular hero and what may be the strongest case to date (though far from the first) for racial parity in Hollywood. But just as important as the film\u2019s titular main character is its setting\u2014an African country that has never been colonized or pillaged. A place that kept its dearest and most valuable resources secret in order to protect them, and to develop as a sovereign state on its own terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs i09 writer and co-author of The Rise of the Black Panther, Evan Narcisse, told the Washington Post, \u201cWakanda represents this unbroken chain of achievement of black excellence that never got broken by colonialism.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Wakanda isn\u2019t a utopia for its lack of conflict\u2014there would certainly be no movie without it\u2014but because of the break it offers from the dystopic narrative that is the literal history of many native peoples around the world: one where colonization, subjugation and, in some places, extermination have been the story.\n\n\ufeff\u201cI always wanted to play a normal person. For me, my goal was to maybe be the best friend.\u201d \u2014Florence Kasumba, actress, \u2018Black Panther\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda also presents a welcome break from an American cinematic tradition that has either ignored the lives of black people or focused heavy-handedly on black trauma and victimhood.\n\nThe net result is a flat cinematic rendering of black humanity, where black people are viewed primarily as survivors of racial trauma and violence. The secondary effect is that many of these films\u20142017\u2019s Detroit is a prime example\u2014often feel like primers for white audiences about the evils of racism than compassionate and complex imaginings of black people as living beings.\n\nThis singular presentation has limited the ways that black audiences could view themselves, stymied filmmakers eager to tell alternative narratives and restricted actors looking to bring more nuanced, truthful characters to the screen. Actress Florence Kasumba, who plays a member of Wakanda\u2019s all-woman royal guard, the Dora Milaje, can speak to that void.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, I wanted to have these role models and I wanted to see maybe people that looked like me where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I could do that, too!\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have that,\u201d Kasumba told The Root. \u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s this movie that\u2019s coming out and you\u2019ve already seen all these different people. And we represent all these different countries or tribes.\u201d\n\nThe Ugandan-born German actress, despite having just one line in Captain America: Civil War, was memorable in that film, as much for the quiet force of her presence as her striking looks. Kasumba is dark-skinned, with Grace Jones-high cheekbones and hair that she keeps cut short even when she\u2019s not playing a member of the Wakandan royal guard. Her looks could easily be described by \u201cmainstream\u201d (that is, white) audiences as \u201cexotic\u201d\u2014a label that always raises the question, \u201cExotic to whom?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose labels typically keep actors like Kasumba from playing the sort of characters that most resemble their experiences.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play a normal person. For me, my goal was to maybe be the best friend,\u201d Kasumba said, adding that the roles she had played before, of refugees and prostitutes, felt very different from her reality.\n\n\n\nWhile those stories are necessary to tell, Wakanda\u2019s is noteworthy because it isn\u2019t a world of compounded trauma; it\u2019s one of self-determination and sovereignty. And for Kasumba, the world of Wakanda on set provided the sort of sisterhood, and normalization, that was missing on other films.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always loved the atmosphere. It was very inspirational,\u201d she said of working with the other Dora. Not only did the actresses who played the Wakandan royal guards represent the diversity of the African Diaspora, but they all had extensive martial arts training and, Kasumba says, frequently assisted one another with fight moves on set.\n\n\u201cI would see my colleagues\u2014I would look at their hair, when they still had hair, or the way they would dress themselves, and there were all these things where I just thought\u2014\u2018I\u2019m not used to that,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cUsually people always say [to me], \u2018Oh wow. You look different.\u2019 Or, \u2018Your style ... ,\u2019 and I don\u2019t find my style so special,\u201d Kasumba added. \u201cBut there I was around all these different people that were all very confident and very at peace with themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Kasumba, working on Black Panther was that chance to blend in\u2014to just feel normal. She never thought she would get that from a superhero film.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was just guys fighting. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d she said. \u201c[My family and I] can\u2019t buy tickets yet in Germany, but I will go out and buy these tickets. Although I was in the movie I\u2019m still thinking, \u2018No, I want to support it because I want people to see it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have to see it probably a hundred times. You know that\u2019s going to be very expensive,\u201d Kasumba said, tilting her head back in laughter.\n\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Kasumba delivered just one line. \u201cMove,\u201d she told Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Black Widow, \u201cor be moved.\u201d It\u2019s a line that, nearly two years later, stands in for the arrival of Wakanda into the cinematic imagination.\n\nBlack Panther director Ryan Coogler is certainly not the first to visualize and create a black utopian space on film. But the difference here is one of scale and magnitude: Never before will so many eyes around the world, at the same time, thanks to a singular movie, confront, revel in and contemplate the possibility of black utopia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis massive collective experience can also give audiences a new shared vocabulary, both visual and verbal, with which to have conversations about blackness, as artist Stacey Robinson says. Last year, for examples, filmgoers used the shorthand of \u201cthe sunken place\u201d from Get Out to discuss the white allegiance and subservience some black people and people of color experience.\n\n\u201cThe beautiful thing about Wakanda, and the way I think about it even in my work as an artist, is I look at these free black spaces as spaces to jump-start conversations about blackness,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThe way I think about black utopian spaces in my speculative work is we get out of colonialism to begin the conversation about who we are. Outside of colonialism, we can be all things that we want to be. Wakanda is a visualization of that.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Wakanda] can actually be the template for what is actually here. What is factual.\u201d\ufeff \u2014Stacey Robinson, artist\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson adds that Wakanda, beyond offering a welcome tonic to a dystopian news cycle, beyond serving as a guide with which to imagine the future, \u201ccan actually be the template for what is actually here. What is factual.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe points out the technologies that black people have created in spite of years of abuse and exploitation. Superheroes like T\u2019Challa are aspirational, but the utopia of Wakanda may give us a way of thinking about and experiencing blackness in the present, Robinson says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho else on the planet has taken the type of abuse that we\u2019ve taken for hundreds of years, and not only have we survived it, but we\u2019ve created some of the best technologies that the world has seen from the last few hundred years?\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking the guts of pigs and creating a delicacy that white people sell to other white people for high dollars. We\u2019ve taken the chitlins, our survival mechanism, and we turned it into a technology for our survival that now is something that\u2019s even gentrified,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cEven the guts that they gave us. We are an amazing people.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast year the images of Themyscira, Wonder Woman\u2019s homeland, enthralled audiences around the world with its glimpse at a lush, women-only utopia (albeit one dominated, it seems, by white women). It hinted at a very specific freedom, away from the war and turmoil of men.\ufeff\n\nWakanda will likely have similar resonance. Wakanda is an unmistakably black utopia, but the fundamental fact of worldwide colonization\u2014one that afflicted the Americas and Asia as well as Africa\u2014gives the mythical African nation enduring symbolism. The questions Wakanda raises, and the success the Black Panther film carves out from this place of origin, are sure to sit with audiences and artists for a long time:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho could we be if the most precious, valuable and beautiful parts of ourselves were left untouched, unpillaged and unspoiled?\n\nWhat would \u201cnormal\u201d have been? What could it be now, if we were only allowed, if we would allow ourselves?\n\nHow do you manifest, however temporarily, that sense of utopia\u2014that sense of possibility?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat more can we move?", "keywords": ["white", "spaces", "wakanda", "kasumba", "world", "space", "game", "wonder", "black", "robinson", "panther", "changer", "artists", "utopian", "audiences", "film"], "polarity": 0.09599531024531027, "subjectivity": 0.4363161576078241},

The trailer hit the Internet with a bang and had the e-streets and the real streets talking. Some folks are already offended by the movie because of the implied depiction of Chicago. Others think that the movie could have promise despite interesting casting choices (Nick Cannon is always an interesting casting choice), and the use of a term that has been largely panned by actual residents of Chicago. Most of us just think Teyonah Parris looks good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpike in typical \"fuck your couch\" fashion has answered back to critics of his upcoming movie - that most us haven't seen yet - with an interview intended to address a lot of the backlash. We've already learned that Spike doesn't give a fuck. And since we know this, Spike was like, why not throw out a music video to go along with the trailer that already caused some ruckus.\n\nWGDB - Kevon Carter from 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks on Vimeo.\n\nWhat we got was a fancy video for a (not so good) song called \"WGDB\" from the Chi-Raq soundtrack. Richard Sherman would be proud. \"WGDB\" is a song about Black-on-Black crime. It opens up talking about about how we care about Bill Cosby, but we forget about the innocent kids killed by other Black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe line, \"we're the only race that shoots and kills themselves,\" actually ends the first stanza.\n\nI'm not sure I even have to address HOW in accurate that line is by itself. But fuckin' wow. The point is clear: Black people are out here claiming #BlackLivesMatter and fighting against injustice all the while we go back home from one of those rallies and shoot one of our neighbors.\n\nI will never understand how any reading person, especially of color, doesn't understand that the Black-on-Black crime issue and the fight of #BlackLivesMatter aren't two separate battles. Is Black-on-Black crime an issue? No. CRIME is an issue. And most people commit crimes against people that look like them. It's heartbreaking every time we hear a story about an innocent child murdered in the streets. And it would be heartbreaking no matter who pulled the trigger. Chicago is one of those cities where the death tallies are staggering and it is sad that these young men are out here killing one another and destroying the community by robbing mothers of sons and wives of husbands and children of fathers. And it does suck that these are Black people killing one another over neighborhood beefs and gang problems. All of that is terrible. And yes, most of them are Black and committing crimes, not because the other people are Black, but because those are the people they have problems with and these cats believe in collateral damage. And they happen to be neighbors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is ALTOGETHER a different issue than being concerned about a social justice system that is inherently unequal that has proven in various locales from coast to coast to value the lives of a Black suspect much less than a white one. It's a whole separate matter that Black people feel a certain fear whenever engaging in any type of contact with a member of law enforcement, knowing that you could end up being the next rallying cry of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Wanting equal treatment and respect is a human issue and right. Asking how we can say that #BlackLivesMatter - a rallying cry aimed at the powers that be in media and law enforcement - when Black people are killing each other in the streets completely mixes messages and misses the point.\n\nBut here Spike goes with his video for this song that effectively equates the two and lobs in the common mistaken refrain that states that Black people aren't any better than the police.\n\nWe got to do better. We need to stop killing each other first before we request equal rights and treatment under the law. Okay, Spike. Your video is cute. It's stupid, but cute. You talked this poor cat into singing too many words in some lines to make the point that we're all worried about the wrong things and that nobody else will respect us until we respect ourselves. Don Lemon and Spike should do a travelling tour at this point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song is dumb because it misses the point. It's the same reason people are concerned about the movie. Spike has made it clear that he does think that Blacks need to clean house first before we worry about others coming into (and killing us, but I ain't one to gossip so you ain't heard that from me). Implying that people care more about what happens to people we don't know because we're so used to killing each other is dangerous, stupid, and frankly irresponsible. It's no wonder why people in Chicago aren't fans of his, no matter what he tries to convince us of.\n\nAgain, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm starting to get the feeling that this movie and songs like \"WGDB\" are Spike's versions of Bill Cosby's \"pound cake\" speech. Innocent children are getting killed in Chicago because we're too busy worried about Meek Mill and Drake. I could have saved somebody's life if I valued it over the life of people I don't know, instead I'm telling police that Black lives matter, when the truth is, I don't care as much as I think I do.\n\nI guess I got to do better.", "keywords": ["killing", "lee", "wgdb", "point", "spike", "song", "movie", "chiraq", "video", "soundtrack", "offends", "black", "issue", "chicago", "think", "misses", "matter", "releases"], "polarity": 0.0641045548654244, "subjectivity": 0.4779848171152519},

But not insane in a shit on your own knuckles and fling it at an Uber driver way. Or even a \"I'm not coming to Thanksgiving this year unless someone promises to put a full-sized yam in Uncle Harry's mouth so he can't rant about abortions and pre-paid legal again\" way. (Basically, he's not Ben Carson.) No, Spike Lee is \"Arthur Edens\" (Tom Wilkinson) in Michael Clayton. His insanity manifests as unfettered lucidity. His only objective in life, only purpose, is telling the truth, regardless of how people perceive it (the truth) and him. Now, whether his version of the truth is actually true is inconsequential. What matters is his fanatical pursuit of it and his complete and utter apathy to how he's perceived.\n\nThis state of being can also be described as \"giving no fucks.\" There are other celebrities (Rihanna, Tom Hardy, Vladimir Putin, etc) known for also existing in that space. But when your public persona is crafted around the idea that you give no fucks, it's proof that you give enough fucks to craft a public persona around the idea that you give none. Spike Lee, however, doesn't even give enough to want people to know he's out of them. He just produces consistently insane work and says consistently insane things, and allows us to assess them however we choose to. Consider Jungle Fever, a movie about the crack epidemic and its effect on cities and families that's hiding inside of a movie about an interracial love affair. Only an insane person would create this movie that way. Only an insane person would name the main characters Flipper and Gator. Only an insane person would conjure and craft this amazing fucking scene.\n\nConsider School Daze, a movie released when he was 30 years old. This is great movie. It is also a movie clearly made by an insane person. Only an insane person would create a movie about the HBCU, film it at Spelman, Morehouse, and Clark (the nexus and genesis of the Black bourgeoisie), show all of the dirt \u2014 the classism, the colorism, the effete administrators \u2014 and then say \"Fuck it. I'm going to make this a musical.\" He did not care that the people at Spelman and Morehouse and Clark would be so offended that he had to finish filming at Morris Brown. Again, he just wants to tell us \u2014 Black people and White people \u2014 his truth about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you accept this, that Spike Lee possesses a very particular grade of sincerely fuck devoid insanity, his work makes more sense. Sometimes it works like hell (Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, When the Levees Broke, Four Little Girls). Sometimes it doesn't (She Hate Me, Bamboozled). And sometimes it leaves you wishing Spike Lee had made the movie a bit less Spike Lee (He Got Game).\n\nAnd, after viewing the trailer to Chiraq, it looks like a quintessential Spike Lee joint. Everything we've come to know and love and hate about his work seems to be present here. Counterintuitive casting decisions. Intentionally provocative and antagonistic subject matter. The absurd bordering on completely batshit \u2014 and kinda, sorta, pornographic \u2014 sexual imagery and politics. The unambiguous allusions to classical works. The conglomeration and congealing of genre. Samuel L Jackson. Its almost as if he makes movies for audiences who have never seen an actual movie before. Which is genius. And, again, insane.

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates, have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based not only on its being the sole place on earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but it\u2019s also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, they are centuries ahead of anywhere else on earth. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders, and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this to Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities, and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So, if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets, and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther.\u201d) Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by the way of New York City.

But with all the excitement in the air, there are some folks who don\u2019t know that Black Panther won\u2019t be the first film based on a Marvel character with a black lead.\n\nThat distinction belongs to Stephen Norrington\u2019s Blade, the 1998 film starring Wesley Snipes as the titular, daywalking vampire who hunted his own kind in an effort to protect humanity from annihilation. It was a bloody, action-packed thriller of a movie that took audiences by surprise and proved that cinematic adaptations of comic books could become box office juggernauts. While Blade undoubtedly paved the way for the current era of comic book movies that Marvel, Fox, and Warner Bros. are currently enjoying, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear the film left out of conversations about just how we got to this point. There are a number of reasons as to why that is and Snipes has a theory of his own.\n\nIn a recent interview with Slate, Snipes recalled how, even as it became clear that Blade was on track to become a hit with fans\u2014and was going to make New Line Cinema a lot of money\u2014people simply couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around the idea of a movie about a black vampire resonating with audiences:\n\nI remember, one of the executives of the studio at the time, in the screening, commented after they did the focus group, and they got back the numbers, and they saw how the numbers was so high, and there was so much appeal for the character and the world, he commented, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why people like this.\u2019 There were others who thought that black people or black talent in film doesn\u2019t sell internationally, doesn\u2019t sell foreign, doesn\u2019t sell in Japan. Bladecomes out, and it blows up in Japan, despite the fact that the lead is a black guy. These were testaments to the lack of cultural awareness, intelligence about the world itself, the global landscape, and the appeal that African American culture has around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point that Snipes is making is neither new nor unique nor difficult to accept. Hollywood has a long history of underestimating films with black leads while claiming that they\u2019re merely trying to look out for their bottom lines. It\u2019s also important to remember that Blade was an R-rated film (you\u2019re welcome, Deadpool) that wasn\u2019t particularly meant for or marketed towards children. Between Comic Book Movies\u2122 not quite being a proper thing back in the late \u201890s and the culture assumption that black films don\u2019t perform well, you can almost understand why some people might not remember Blade. I say almost because Blade\u2019s phenomenal and there\u2019s really no excuse to have forgotten it.\n\nJudging from early sales figures, Black Panther once again disproves the idea that black films can\u2019t make big bucks when given the proper care and attention they deserve. Now imagine what a rebooted Blade movie (or series) with a proper budget and marketing campaign behind it might look like.\n\n\n\n[Slate]", "keywords": ["wesley", "important", "movie", "idea", "black", "proper", "snipes", "good", "sell", "remember", "panther", "films", "blade", "dont", "film"], "polarity": 0.031274217585692994, "subjectivity": 0.4106213185721384},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment. It\u2019s a good day to be black and sexy.", "keywords": ["1994", "movie", "soundtrack", "album", "black", "im", "think", "movies", "good", "panther", "soundtracks"], "polarity": 0.12011621556014075, "subjectivity": 0.40551459184636757},

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children.

Not in the sense that you\u2019ve seen anything like it before (trust me, you haven\u2019t), but rather that seeing it feels like coming home.\n\n\n\nFor all of its technological wonders and visual delights, Black Panther is, in its deepest heart of hearts, the type of family drama that nearly everyone can relate to in one way or another. Before diving into the present-day status quo established in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther opens with a promise and a betrayal\u2014fraternal twins of fate whose very existences immediately give the movie\u2019s plot a Shakespearean sense of grandeur and intimacy.\n\nThe promise is of Wakanda itself\u2014symbolized in a brief, but powerful flashback to a younger T\u2019Chaka (played in his prime by Atandwa Kani, whose father, John Kani, portrays the older T\u2019Chaka both here and in Civil War) checking in on a covert intelligence mission in the United States. The betrayal is what T\u2019Chaka finds, a revelation that both changes the course of Wakanda\u2019s future and gets at the heart of one of the more difficult ideas Black Panther repeatedly asks: If Wakanda is the mighty beacon of excellence it claims to be, why hasn\u2019t it done more to help the world?\n\nThe question rises to the surface of the Royal Family\u2019s minds once again after an encounter with Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) inadvertently draws CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) into the Wakandans\u2019 midst. The country\u2019s culture of secrecy and isolationism is an important and fascinating part of its larger mythos, but it\u2019s one that Black Panther purposefully inspects and challenges through the various drives and goals of its characters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs its newly crowned King, T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is deeply vested in hewing to tradition, as his mother and father taught him. But a certain degree of uncertainty about how to embody a king\u2019s identity gives him the opportunity for some flexibility in his approach to shaping Wakanda\u2019s relationship to the world. Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a spy who frequently travels beyond Wakanda\u2019s borders and has seen the strife and poverty in the wider world, is adamant that Wakanda could become a larger force for global good. Describing Okoye (Danai Gurira) as simply the general of the Dora Milaje isn\u2019t entirely accurate; she is in almost every sense of the title, Hand to the King, second only to his mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett). Together, they represent a strong bloc in favor of Wakandan traditionalism\u2014a bloc that would be completely unified were it not for Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), T\u2019Challa\u2019s genius, teenaged sister who\u2019s more interested in her scientific research at the Wakandan Design Group than family politics.\n\nThough the Royal Family and those closest to them are not always in agreement with one another, there\u2019s a balance to their nuclear unit which strengthens the Wakandan throne. The stability of the Royal Family ensures the trust and allegiance of the other Wakandan tribes\u2014like the Jabari, a group of anti-technological people who live in the mountainous northern region of the country, where they\u2019re led by M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke). Each of the Wakandan tribes is a distinct cultural presence led by different figureheads who all have their own political agendas.\n\nWakanda\u2019s inner workings are intricate and at times strained, but the status quo of remaining isolated works specifically because the Wakandans put their own survival first. Given the specter of colonialism on the African continent, that\u2019s understandable. However, the promise of Wakanda introduced during the film\u2019s opening is, in a striking and beautiful way, the audience\u2019s entryway into seeing how someone from the outside might grow to resent the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Black Panther is actually one of the more grounded and human Marvel films, Erik Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) villainous motivation is immediately understandable and completely relatable. If you knew what he knew, you\u2019d want to fight T\u2019Challa, too. Even in the moments where Killmonger\u2019s ambition to take the Wakandan throne boil over into overt bloodthirstiness, there\u2019s a voice in the back of your head reminding you what brought him to that point, and why maybe he has a point.\n\nIn a very literal way, Killmonger is the embodiment of the pain and anguish that comes along with being a black American who is unable to trace their familial roots back more than a few generations. Those gaps in ancestral knowledge are the direct result of families being murdered and wiped from the historical record, never to be fully known or remembered by their descendants. Killmonger\u2019s trauma is something that T\u2019Challa can\u2019t fully grasp, given the nature of his own upbringing. The two become diametrically opposed to one another, despite the fact that they are both fundamentally fighting for the betterment of their shared people.\n\nOf all the players in T\u2019Challa\u2019s orbit, Killmonger is the most extreme in his beliefs that Wakanda should be both open and expansionist. His vision is the all-too-understandable conclusion that dawns on every single black person once we consider everything an open Wakanda could be and mean, not just for the world, but specifically for the African diaspora. Black Panther asks the kinds of questions about Wakanda that aren\u2019t fun to think about, but are important all the same. How might the course of history been changed had the country not been closed off? What might global blackness look and feel like in a world like that? The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a world in which those questions can be asked in earnest and the Wakandan people have to grapple with the possible answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn\u2019t contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda\u2019s magnificence. Though Wakanda is an Afrofuturist wonderland, it\u2019s still meant to be an actual place on Earth and it feels like it. Director Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison craft breathtaking, on-the-ground shots that give Wakanda\u2019s streets a texture and vibrancy that blends old-world hustle and bustle with gleaming accents of the future.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also pleasantly surprising how funny Black Panther is. While the movie\u2019s tone never dips too, too deep into abject misery, there are enough moments of solemnity that when a joke about T\u2019Challa\u2019s dad sandals pops up, you\u2019re not really prepared to laugh quite that hard. Though the movie\u2019s comedic moments land squarely, they\u2019re also subtle, often bubbling up suddenly\u2014almost as if willed into existence by the chemistry between the cast. There\u2019s a palpable love between T\u2019Challa, Ramonda, Shuri, and Okoye that propels them forward as a unit; at the same time, there\u2019s a complicated understanding between them all and Killmonger that keeps the plot compelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s action builds effortless, upward momentum that immediately reminds you that you\u2019re still in a humongous Marvel movie. Thankfully, there\u2019s no big, glowing, CGI deus ex machina waiting as Black Panther\u2019s ultimate big bad, but the film\u2019s penultimate major battle is chock full of just enough explosions to scratch your itch if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to say about Black Panther because, like Wakanda, it\u2019s an embarrassment of riches that you can\u2019t really hope to fully unpack in one sitting. It\u2019s the kind of Marvel movie that definitely benefits from more than a single viewing, and it\u2019s one that\u2019ll draw you in\u2014and blow your mind every single time.", "keywords": ["marvels", "wakandas", "wakanda", "shakespearean", "world", "marvel", "black", "family", "tchalla", "panther", "theres", "epic", "wakandan"], "polarity": 0.12236610288935874, "subjectivity": 0.46050496660961776},

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible. And so it was really world-building in its truest form.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.", "keywords": ["process", "lot", "wakanda", "complicated", "beachler", "world", "creating", "vibranium", "black", "coogler", "wanted", "cole", "panther", "exhilarating"], "polarity": 0.1521029814067789, "subjectivity": 0.44748481476329593},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

According to a number of the film\u2019s female stars, their characters\u2019 strength is a direct reflection of Wakanda\u2019s cultural history.\n\nBecause of the fictional country\u2019s historical isolationist worldview, a lot of things about Wakanda are vastly different from its neighboring nation states and other international actors. For instance, it\u2019s vast stores of vibranium and the development of fantastical technology. But in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Angela Bassett, who portrays Queen Mother Ramonda, said that Wakanda\u2019s culture is also the reason that Black Panther features so many dynamic women whose nurturing qualities are seen as signs of strength.\n\nActress Danai Guriria, who plays Okoye, further explained that because Wakanda was never invaded or colonized, its culture was predisposed to becoming more egalitarian along gender lines:\n\nThey were a nation uninterrupted. They got to go through their full evolution. Other countries on the continent were very interrupted and traumatized through colonization. Wakanda didn\u2019t have that disruption. It was such an advanced nation, it actually allowed for evolution of gender roles. It recognized that you allow all your citizens to advance to their full potential.\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o portrays Nakia, a Wakandan spy who periodically slips pasts the country\u2019s airtight borders to collect valuable intel about the wider world around them. Though she\u2019s very much a love interest for T\u2019Challa, Nakia moves through Black Panther with a freedom and flexibility that means she\u2019s never expected to wait around for the king, something that inspired Nyong\u2019o:\n\nIt was such a breath of fresh air seeing men and women living in their power with out one dwarfing the other. To me it was reflective of the fact that sexism is learned. To see a society where that\u2019s not the focal point, where gender is not the fabric with which society is built and the delineations of sex are not oppressive, that\u2019s really cool. And it\u2019s possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EW piece with Black Panther\u2019s leading women also features a video and is chock full of all kinds of fabulous insight into the movie and you should definitely give it a read and watch before the film drops this Friday.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Before he went on to make Blade, Wesley Snipes campaigned long and hard to get the ball rolling on a live-action Black Panther adaptation in which he would have starred. Though the project never quite came to fruition, Snipes\u2019 description of that \u201890s Black Panther film is a fascinating taste of what might have been.\n\n\n\nSnipes spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how his own Black Panther project actually got much farther along in the production process than most people realize (if they knew about it at all). Multiple scripts were written, Snipes himself (who was a hot commodity throughout the early-to-mid \u201890s) was attached to star, and both Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton were in the running to direct.\n\nBut for all the potential Snipes\u2019 Panther might have had, comic books and movies based on them didn\u2019t have the same kind of cultural cache and relevance that they do today and not everyone was on board with the idea of sticking close to the source material. Though Snipes felt it was important to emphasize Wakanda\u2019s technological prowess\u2014something we\u2019ll definitely be seeing in Marvel\u2019s film\u2014others, like Singleton, thought it would be smarter to go in a different direction:\n\n\u201cJohn was like, \u2018Nah! Hah! Hah! See, he\u2019s got the spirit of the Black Panther, but he is trying to get his son to join the [civil rights activist] organization. And he and his son have a problem, and they have some strife because he is trying to be politically correct and his son wants to be a knucklehead.\u2019 \u201c I am loosely paraphrasing our conversation.

The jewel Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnipes also described a number of other angles for the film that would have focused on a version of T\u2019Challa who didn\u2019t grow up in Wakanda in the years before he became king. As odd as that may sound, bear in mind that the \u201890s were a very, very different time for Marvel and Black Panther. At the time, Marvel had recently sold off the film rights to a number of its characters in an attempt to stave off its impending bankruptcy.\n\nEven though Columbia Pictures was interested in potentially producing Snipes\u2019 Black Panther, technological and budgetary constraints proved to be insurmountable issues. CGI wasn\u2019t anything close to what it\u2019s like today and capturing the sheer grandeur of Wakanda would have called for a gargantuan budget. It\u2019s nice to think that there was almost an OG Black Panther film that we could have been looking back on with fondness (or derision, who knows) for years, but to hear the way Snipes describes his vision for T\u2019Challa\u2019s vibranium suit, perhaps it\u2019s best the movie never got made:\n\n\u201cActually, I figured it would be a leotard. A leotard with maybe some little cat ears on it.

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career. But when director Ryan Coogler came to her and asked if she wanted to star in his adaptation of Black Panther, she was so eager to join the project, she didn\u2019t even pause to read the script first.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvel called and said that Ryan was interested in me for a role in Panther, and I talked to him about it, and obviously everything was hush-hush, but he walked me through his initial ideas, and I thought, \u2018Wait a minute?

She said it was because she was thrilled about the story Coogler was telling, about an African country that had \u201cmanaged to keep its autonomy and be self-determining\u201d because it was shielded from colonization. Nyong\u2019o, whose father is a prominent opposition leader in Kenyan politics, said the film\u2019s implicit political themes also drew her to the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe were creating an aspirational world where an African people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy.

Coogler commented about her dedication to the project, saying she did \u201ca lot of homework\u201d on Black Panther in order to understand her role and the country of Wakanda. She spent months doing rigorous physical training for the complex stunt work, focusing on jujitsu and capoeira, and even injured herself during shooting. Nyong\u2019o also said she had to learn to speak with the accent actor Chadwick Boseman took on for the role, which meant utilizing clicking sounds. \u201cThere\u2019s three different clicks, like three different letters,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther comes out February 16 and we can\u2019t wait to see Nyong\u2019o in action.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["wait", "nyongo", "pumped", "read", "script", "didnt", "role", "black", "coogler", "different", "panther", "african", "sign", "lupita"], "polarity": 0.1191919191919192, "subjectivity": 0.3822330447330447},

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged.

Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood.

But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["nicholas", "white", "murder", "gun", "jews", "illness", "neonazi", "identifies", "nationalist", "teen", "charged", "huffpost", "mental", "heres", "twitter", "tweeted", "disturbing", "tied", "young"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "trump", "shooting", "youre", "guns", "day", "convention", "black", "person", "matter", "shot", "nra", "age"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

But actually seeing the commercial for what Hasbro is offering made me pause and feel something deeply emotional.\n\nIf you ask many comic book fans of color which characters they grew up loving, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll name a white character like Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Batman. To be fair, these characters are great, but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re exponentially more widely marketed across a variety of media than other characters and so people come to know and identify with them more readily.\n\nA big part of how we come to love characters has to do with how much we\u2019re exposed to them and how often we\u2019re able to see ourselves in them in a meaningful way. Reading as the Black Panther and his genius sister Shuri save the world in the pages of comics is one thing, but seeing young black children actually embody those characters while having fun is something much more powerful. That\u2019s what makes Hasbro\u2019s line of Black Panther toys and the way the company\u2019s marketing them so incredibly fantastic.\n\n\n\nIn the first ad the company released, a black boy dons T\u2019Challa\u2019s Black Panther mask and claws, while a black girl along with a non-black friend wield Shuri\u2019s panther gauntlets as the trio are transported from their backyard directly to Wakanda. Obviously, the mask and claws are plastic with a bit of circuitry in them and the gauntlets are a new kind of Nerf gun but to be clear\u2014you almost never see toy ads aimed at and starring black children, and starring as the leads no less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause characters of color have historically been relatively marginalized in movies, comics, and television, toys and commercials like this simply haven\u2019t existed before which is a shame in and of itself but has deeper consequences. Oftentimes, the first step towards becoming a fan of something or part of a larger fandom is finding a character that you can relate to when you\u2019re young and then seeing your relationship with them validated by the world around you.\n\n\n\nThat feedback loop of identification, and then affirmation, is what creates the ideas that \u201cI can be a hero too\u201d and \u201cthis fandom can be a place for me, as well.\u201d Toys and commercials like these, perhaps even more than the movies they\u2019re promoting, can have a way of creating lasting impressions and memories on kids for whom they\u2019re a gateway into a larger world of fantasy and scifi. Suddenly, they\u2014along with T\u2019Challa and co.\u2014are the ones defeating villains and protecting the planet. That kind of direct representation can have a profound impact on one\u2019s self-esteem in the long term.\n\nYes, these are just toys, but at the same time, they\u2019re so much more. They\u2019re an invitation\u2014an affirmation\u2014and something I wish I\u2019d had when I was growing up.", "keywords": ["toy", "important", "theyre", "understand", "way", "seeing", "world", "starring", "commercial", "black", "characters", "panther", "toys", "young"], "polarity": 0.17847673160173153, "subjectivity": 0.4506551484230054},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "organization", "terrorist", "legal", "directly", "second", "deaths", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

The flyers and campaign mail issue warnings on Latinx gangs, undocumented immigrants, gun control and the \u201canti-military\u201d NFL protests.\n\nAnti-Immigrant and Anti-Islam\n\nTrump opened his presidential campaign with a call to bar immigration from Mexico, falsely claiming that many Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists. He would continue to make anti-immigration the center of his platform, eventually pledging to build a big, \u201cbeautiful\u201d wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConservatives in local and state races across the country have employed similar tactics in hopes of getting out the vote.\n\nTomorrow, many politicians and pundits will be looking to the Virginia governors race as a bellwether for how effective this play toward white racial identity politics is. Even though GOP candidate Ed Gillespie, a former \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican, has given Trump the cold shoulder, his campaign has certainly been warm to racist signaling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGillespie has threatened to ban \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in Virginia, although the commonwealth has none; in doing so, he frequently alludes to the threat of gang violence, particularly MS-13, a gang with roots in El Salvador.\n\nAnother pro-GOP ad distributed in Prince William and Stafford counties in liberal-leaning northern Virginia criticizes delegate candidate Jennifer Foy for advocating that undocumented students in Virginia be allowed to pay in-state tuition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd Virginia students are being denied at our state universities,\u201d the ad reads in bold, over a picture of a forlorn-looking white woman. It would be comical if it weren\u2019t playing to a very real sentiment: that no matter how high achieving, how much quantifiably better an undocumented student is, they should be denied the ability to advance their education in favor of mediocre white students whose only virtue is being born white and Virginian.\n\nSimilar examples can be found in an Edison, N.J., school board race, where a flyer implored potential voters to stop two Asian-American candidates from \u201ctaking over our school board.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Chinese and Indians are taking over our town!\u201d read the flyer, accompanied by two photos of the candidates with the word \u201cdeport\u201d added over their images.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis play toward xenophobia is often coupled with Islamophobia\u2014even if the Muslims in question are American-born. One prime example is a recent tweet from Bo Dietl, a former NYPD detective who is challenging New York City incumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nOn Monday morning, Deitl tweeted out a photo of de Blasio and activist Linda Sarsour with the caption, \u201cCan NYC trust this guy with our homeland security needs?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was actually the second version of his tweet and more prominently homed in on Sarsour\u2019s identity and claimed she was \u201cSharia Law, anti-Israel.\u201d A previous version didn\u2019t name her at all, simply letting the mayor standing next to a woman in a hijab accompany the caption, \u201cThis city needs a mayor with values that reflect its citizens.\u201d\n\nTaking a \u201cStand\u201d\n\nAnother recurring call to arms is the NFL protests. In Albany, N.Y., one flyer had several images of NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem with the caption, \u201cHave you had enough of the disrespect for our veterans, flag and country? Send a message ... vote Republican.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Kevin Blackistone noted on his Twitter account, it was a precise mix of sports and politics that the conservative football fans claim to hate.\n\nOther flyers simply alluded to the protests. \u201cProud to stand for our national anthem,\u201d read one pamphlet sent to voters in Erie County, N.Y. As though that were the most important quality one needed to be a sheriff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile conservative calls to patriotism are nothing new, the specific focus on national anthem protests is notable. As a recent Washington Post report unpacked, the vitriol against black athletes who choose to protest during the national anthem contains no small amount of resentment about their perceived wealth.\n\nFor right-leaning voters in 2017, standing for the national anthem is a stand-in for love of country, for virtue and respect for the military, but also a specific kind of anti-blackness that asks black athletes to be grateful for being well-compensated for their work. In this way, these flyers appeal to white voters\u2019 ethno-nationalism as much as they do their \u201cpatriotism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGun Control\n\nBefore a gunman opened fire on a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5, conservatives were drumming up fears that Democratic candidates would confiscate firearms.\n\nIn Virginia, NRA ads applauded Gillespie\u2019s stance on \u201cno background checks.\u201d In Sussex County, N.J., a Republican mailer claimed that Democratic freeholder candidate Dan Perez would would bring \u201cunlimited illegal immigration to the county\u201d and take away \u201clegal firearms\u201d\u2014even though he had absolutely no power to do those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, one group whose gun rights conservatives don\u2019t want to see protected?

The annual Democrats-vs.-Republicans baseball game was a day away, and the participants were just wrapping up a successful workout.\n\n\n\nNobody suspected a mass shooting.\n\nRep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, said he thinks that as he was leaving the field, he encountered the shooter, who asked if the players were Democrats or Republicans. It was an ordinary exchange that Duncan said was not in any way \u201cearth-shattering,\u201d and he made his way with colleagues up to Capitol Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Duncan recognized that there had been a shooting, and that it was a late-middle-aged \u201cnormal looking\u201d white man who had perpetrated the attack on sitting U.S. legislators, he also recognized that it was the same man who\u2019d spoken to him.\n\nJames T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Bellville, Ill., was identified as the man who used a rifle to unload dozens of rounds, leaving the legislators and their aides and onlookers to seek refuge in the dugout or to cover in place in the dirt and grass.\n\nEyewitness interviews described the shooter as being \u201cnormal looking,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d \u201ca little on the chubby side,\u201d \u201cprobably Anglo\u201d and \u201cregular.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the press conference, Alexandria police officials and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe stressed that it was \u201cnot likely\u201d that Hodgkinson held any ties to terrorist organizations. According to the New York Times, he did hold some resentment over Donald Trump\u2019s election. This, again, was a likely case of a lone-wolf, again, white man with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the gunman has since died from his injuries, he lived long enough to be taken to George Washington University Hospital, where the care he received is among the best in the region. His victims are all expected to recover.\n\nThe highest-profile of the shooting victims is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the Republican who represents the 1st Congressional District of Louisiana in the suburbs of New Orleans. Scalise was hit in the hip, and the surgery to repair his gunshot wound is reported by authorities to have been successful.\n\nAmid the platitudes about thoughts and prayers and unity that are all too common after such events, what we\u2019re not yet hearing is some common sense and some clear definitions to call a thing what it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, this was indeed a terrorist act. Hunting down legislators, even those with whom one disagrees, is a crime that holds at its center the intent to make an example of the shot politician. The logic is simple: Vote my way or this could happen to you.\n\nThe man who perpetuated this terrorism was a terrorist.\n\nBlack shooters and brown shooters do not get such benefit of the doubt. If any black or brown person shoots and kills, one never hears the phrase, \u201cThis is an EDP,\u201d an \u201cemotionally disturbed person.\u201d Instead, cue the tired rhetoric, \u201cThis thug needs to be put down,\u201d or \u201cThose people practice a violent religion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe talk of mental illness is immediate when a white man takes up his arms and turns them against innocents. Despite that, the overwhelming majority of people who have mental illness never become violent, terroristic killers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if we are to grant that this particular shooter in the Alexandria incident did suffer from mental illness, there is still a main question to be answered. And it should be laid at the feet of Scalise and his similar-voting colleagues on Capitol Hill. We have to ask legislators, \u201cCan we talk about protecting Americans from the proven threat that is domestic terror?\u201d\n\nScalise holds an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. He also was on Donald Trump\u2019s Second Amendment Coalition, which wants to make it easier for residents of the District of Columbia to obtain guns. He has also fought to do away with provisions restricting mentally ill people from buying guns. Scalise co-sponsored the Firearms Interstate Commerce Reform Act, which aimed to remove restrictions on interstate firearms transactions.\n\nWhile the Second Amendment is treated as a sacred edict from the heavens, never to be touched, these are legislators who are happy to change laws about voting rights, equal access to women\u2019s health care and mental-health care as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese legislators, and much of the media, too, are far too comfortable with the status quo that white men with guns are the prime illustration of what it is to be an American\u2014no matter on whom they turn those weapons.\n\nIt was almost a year ago when GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul was uninjured Wednesday as he and other legislators fled the hail of gunfire while another lone-wolf white man with a gun unleashed his fury at unarmed people who couldn\u2019t defend themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s time to do more than wring our hands and talk about how futile it is to even make a request for a real conversation about this issue.\n\nCongress must absolutely get in line with medical professionals, who explain that gun violence is a public health issue, just like clean water and safe food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we must all do a better job in calling a terrorist a terrorist.

Through his social media posts, it was clear to me that Wade was charismatic, unassuming and bright and navigated the world in a very self-assured way. What was also evident was his genuine love for people and for his community. Put simply, Wade was a star who was wise beyond his years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, he also became a victim of gun violence and was taken from us this past Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nAccording to KPRC Click2Houston, Wade and 29-year-old Mario Jerrell Williams reportedly got into a heated argument. A witness reported seeing Williams leave the bedroom of Wade\u2019s home in Atascocita, Texas, apparently upset. The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him repeatedly to leave, which he finally did, according to the police report.\n\nWilliams returned, and moments later, the witness heard two gunshots and ran out, only to see Wade\u2019s twin brother, Stephen, asking someone to call 911, KPRC reports. Williams later turned himself in to the police and is currently being held at Harris County Jail in Texas on $100,000 bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after his death, many media outlets began framing this killing as a violent lover\u2019s quarrel\u2014a crime of passion, perhaps. I will never forget sitting in criminal law and procedure classes in 2009, as a first-year law student, thinking about the nonsense of certain \u201ccrimes of passion.\u201d\n\nSome crimes of passion are deeply connected to possession, ownership, jealousy and ideas of romanticism. None of that is truly connected to passion, and it certainly isn\u2019t connected to love\u2014not the kind any of us should find to be true, anyway. Society owes it to all people to do a better job of discussing the ways that intimate-partner violence (pdf) affects all communities, but especially ones that are often forgotten, like black queer and transgender populations.\n\nStill, Wade\u2019s close friends make clear that what\u2019s most important is how we\u2014as writers, academics and folks at the margins\u2014frame how he lived, especially when mainstream media may find it more valuable to sensationalize how he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Wade\u2019s life reminds us of the importance of calling into question love, romance and desire in black queerdom. He reminds us of the critical dialogue we should have on how toxic masculinity and patriarchy become increasingly dangerous when compounded with feelings of unrequited love and attraction. His life and death call to attention the ways in which violence cannot be viewed through a narrow prism when we\u2019re considering the intersections of blackness and queerness.\n\nBut that is not the extent of his legacy. Wade worked fervently so that those without a \u201cbright future\u201d\u2014individuals who often fall between the cracks of mass incarceration, poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia\u2014would not be forgotten.\n\nThat memory should not be erased.\n\n\u201cDevon Wade was a force, an angel amongst men. He was a gentle spirit, who generated electricity in all spaces he dwelled,\u201d said Jeffrey McCune of Washington University in St. Louis, a mentor and friend to Wade. \u201cHis life\u2019s work, examining the impact of incarcerated parents on children, was to be a shape-shifter to the sociology of education. He is sorely missed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade understood firsthand the direct impact that mass incarceration had on young people and families. As he was growing up, both his mother and father were in prison, so he was raised by his grandparents. But from all accounts, instead of blaming his parents, he realized their personal struggles and he decided to tackle oppressive systems\u2014such as the prison-industrial complex\u2014and how they affect black communities.\n\nWhile a student at M.B. Smiley High School, Wade enrolled in No More Victims, a program for young people whose parents are incarcerated. Wade eventually became an honors graduate at Louisiana State University, a Harry S. Truman scholar and then a doctoral student at Columbia in New York City, studying sociology. He talked about these experiences often, how they collectively shaped his work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and how he had to unpack his own trauma.\n\nIn the YouTube clip \u201cWho Is: Devon Tyrone Wade,\u201d Wade noted, \u201cI had not yet necessarily had that conversation with my parents about what their being in prison meant for me. And even though I had in most cases excelled \u2026 there were a whole host of things that impacted me in ways I kept inside.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, not only was Wade able to find his own voice, but he was also able to empower others to find theirs.\n\n\n\nWade\u2019s work was focused on not just what happens when we lock up individuals but also what happens to their families. What happens to those communities? What happens to returning citizens once they are released from prison? Wade wanted to create a society that allowed for the most marginalized to survive and thrive by providing resources and also by understanding how trauma is punished for already at-risk youths.\n\n\u201cWhat we will miss from [Wade] is that he speaks assuredly but not abrasively so. He is inclusive, welcoming, warm and wanted his work to extend beyond nonacademics,\u201d close friend and colleague Adam Smith told The Root. \u201cHe wanted to make sure his work was not just contributing to the research but to the people that needed it the most.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade was a budding scholar, a critical thinker and a person known by everyone to show compassion for marginalized communities. He was taken from us by way of gun violence, despite doing what society told us was \u201cright.\u201d Although we can\u2019t bring Wade back, we must continue passing the torch by uplifting often-forgotten people, the alleged downtrodden, those whom society further pushes into the margins.\n\nWhat happened to Wade shouldn\u2019t have happened. He should still be with us and those who loved him most in the world. It is now our responsibility to continue pushing and thinking of collateral consequences of the prison-industrial complex and policing of neighborhoods, and make sure that his life\u2019s work was not in vain.", "keywords": ["student", "violence", "prison", "disrupting", "remembered", "ways", "merely", "wades", "wanted", "pipeline", "society", "parents", "work", "williams", "died", "wade", "devon"], "polarity": 0.1564536066343295, "subjectivity": 0.5571249500165161},

(She isn\u2019t a white supremacist or anything, but she did say that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are better than Krispy Kremes, which is kind of Hitler-ish, in my opinion.)\n\nIf there is one thing on which we can all agree, I have always assumed, it\u2019s that as a society, we all think murdering children is\u2014at the very least\u2014not a good look.\n\nApparently, I was wrong.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a baby-murdering white guy walked into a church and opened fire, killing people as young as 17 months old. In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

A Facebook photograph showed him enjoying a World Series game at Dodger Stadium with his affluent parents, with whom he often enjoys trips to Mexican resorts and the other fine things in life, according to the Breeze.\n\nThe Breeze notes that Terrell\u2019s father, Donald Wayne Terrell, is president of the media consulting firm New & Improved Media in El Segundo, Calif., while his mother is a South Bay interior designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerrell also apparently remains in school, which has created more than a buzz among parents. Nonetheless, Palos Verdes Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin said that officials were aware of the charges this young thug faces, declaring that \u201cvigilance is high.\u201d\n\nHowever, Austin did not confirm Terrell\u2019s status at school, saying only very generally that students have the right to a public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very clear exclusion criteria that have to occur before a student was not allowed to attend a public school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor a school suspension of any kind, there has to be a direct nexus to the school itself,\u201d Austin added. \u201cThese allegations have no nexus to our school. The allegations and charges against a student without a nexus to school would not be grounds for exclusion.\u201d\n\nThe charges against this wannabe thug stem from the shooting of Holmes on Oct. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Holmes and two other friends were confronted by two armed individuals who asked where they were from. One armed thug fired several shots, hitting Holmes, while his friends managed to run away.\n\nThe shooter and an accomplice ran back to a black car that drove away. Holmes was rushed to the hospital but couldn\u2019t be saved.\n\nPolice say that Holmes and his friends were not linked to any gang activity.\n\nTwo other suspects are currently in custody on suspicion of murder; however, both are under 18 and are currently being held in a juvenile facility. Their names have not been disclosed. However, the district attorney\u2019s office is reportedly looking to push to have them tried as adults, according to the Breeze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this w3.cdn.anvato.net embed.\n\nRead more at the Daily Breeze.", "keywords": ["white", "murder", "man", "connection", "shooting", "school", "spotted", "days", "terrell", "world", "nexus", "game", "oct", "series", "parents", "holmes", "charges", "thug"], "polarity": 0.07939299830604178, "subjectivity": 0.4015273856578204},

It seems this is what the Air Force calls it when you choke a woman and fracture a child\u2019s skull: bad conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is a person who had violent tendencies,\u201d Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday in response to a question about how Kelley, who is now dead, was able to obtain a gun. \u201cHow that got through the cracks, I don\u2019t have that information.\u201d\n\nBut come Tuesday, we did have that information: the Air Force did not enter Kelley\u2019s domestic violence conviction into the National Criminal Information Center database, so he was able to purchase an AR-556 rifle\u2014more or less a dupe of an AR-15\u2014from a gun store in San Antonio without incident. It is not a surprise when men like Kelley get through the cracks. Our system of regulating domestic abusers\u2019 access to firearms is all cracks.\n\nStill, there are other things that we know equally well, and which remain true and politically untouched no matter how many times we find ourselves in this same place: It is very easy to get a gun in the United States; and where there are more guns, more women die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost women killed in this country, 55 percent, die in an incident related to intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those women, more than 90 percent, are killed by a current or former intimate partner. Most of those deaths, 54 percent, are gun deaths.\n\nThis happens every day\u2014nearly three times a day, actually. But we generally don\u2019t talk about our dead women until our angry men kill other people\u2014at churches in Texas or baseball fields in Virginia or gay night clubs in Florida or health clinics in Colorado.\n\nWhen we talk about these dead women, or the women who survive domestic violence and function as a set of parallel statistics, it is often as a kind of foreshadowing to violence considered more consequential: mass shootings. The women are canaries in the coal mine, or the grotesque connective tissue that bind these shooters, overwhelmingly white men, to one another. In death, they are minor characters in some other kind of story about some other kind of violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen things quiet down again, we will return to a system that does not maintain comprehensive records on men barred from owning a gun, does not meaningfully enforce the laws that might take their guns away from them, and does not consider all intimate partner violence equally disqualifying. And so more women die. The daily realities of domestic violence fade into white noise until another mass shooting compels us to talk about it again, which is why I know we will be back here soon enough.\n\nFor more news and opinions that get under your skin, follow us on Facebook.", "keywords": ["dead", "gun", "domestic", "partner", "kind", "killed", "women", "signs", "men", "warning", "violence", "talk", "texas"], "polarity": 0.06928462709284627, "subjectivity": 0.40452815829528155},

But this isn\u2019t a guns situation,\u201d he added.\n\nTime notes that Trump made his comments after a reporter asked about gun-control measures in light of another mass shooting in the U.S. during a joint press conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. However, Trump brushed the question off, saying it was \u201ca little bit soon\u201d to be discussing guns, despite the recent proliferation of mass shootings across the country and the thousands who lose their lives each year to gun violence.\n\n\u201cFortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction; otherwise it [wouldn\u2019t] have been as bad as it was \u2026 it would have been much worse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a local man who grabbed his own rifle and chased the shooter after the carnage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, despite Trump\u2019s claims, it currently remains unclear if the shooter, identified as 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley, showed any signs of mental illness, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nKelley did, however, receive a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force three years ago after he was court-martialed and convicted of assaulting his spouse and their child.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nFederal law prohibits a person who has been dishonorably discharged from buying a firearm. Whether Kelley\u2019s discharge would trigger the law was not immediately clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times also notes:\n\nThe 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell a weapon to a person with a dishonorable discharge or for such a person \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d\n\nKelley was sentenced to 12 months in custody.\n\nAfter his prison stint, Kelley was reduced in rank until he was ultimately released from the military on a bad-conduct discharge in 2014, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthorities found several weapons in Kelley\u2019s vehicle after he died, although it is not clear how he got them.\n\nIf the law should have prevented Kelley from getting his hands on firearms, it definitely sounds like there\u2019s a lot more going on than a mental health issue. But we know how the dialogue goes. More and more people die, there are no safe places, and the finger is pointed everywhere except at the smoking gun.", "keywords": ["gun", "law", "trump", "shooting", "lot", "problem", "mass", "person", "health", "discharge", "kelley", "mental", "texas"], "polarity": -0.02006578947368422, "subjectivity": 0.39583333333333326},
