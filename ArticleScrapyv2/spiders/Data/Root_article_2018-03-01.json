And you\u2019d be mad at her. But then, after the shock from the sliced tendons began to subside, you\u2019d be even more furious at my wife and me. Because who bought her the machete?

Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) have introduced bills that would restrict the president\u2019s singular authority to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike without a declaration of war by Congress. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) introduced a one-sentence bill (pdf) stating that the United States should not use nuclear weapons first.\n\n\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to not use nuclear weapons first,\u201d the bill reads.\n\nThe rationale is clear: No one person should have the power to kill millions of people in less than 30 minutes\u2014especially someone as reckless as Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past five decades or so, it has generally been accepted that the power to launch a nuclear strike rests in the hands of the president. It is a curious arrangement because a nuclear strike, by default, is a declaration of war, something that Congress is constitutionally required to authorize.\n\nSome nuclear arms experts see it differently. Robert Kehler, former commander of the United States Strategic Command, told the Senate on Tuesday, \u201cConflicting signals can result in loss of confidence, confusion or paralysis in the operating forces at a critical moment.\u201d\n\nIn the case of responding to a nuclear attack by a foreign adversary, that would be true. Proponents of the bills are more concerned that Trump could call for an unnecessary nuclear attack without cause and there is nothing in writing to check him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can use nuclear weapons and not read that as a declaration of war,\u201d said Tom Collina, director of policy at Ploughshares Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based organization whose goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cWe need to clarify the authorities the president has,\u201d Collina said. \u201cThis legislation is necessary to clarify Congress\u2019 view that you may not use nuclear weapons first without approval of Congress.\u201d\n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution was written at a time when nuclear weapons didn\u2019t exist. It is also likely that none of the signees anticipated that someone like Trump would be elected to oversee what has become the world\u2019s most powerful military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December, Trump threatened a nuclear arms race, even though the United States commands the world\u2019s most powerful nuclear arsenal and, with the exception of Russia, no other nuclear power comes close to matching it.\n\nWhile North Korea is in the final stages of building a viable nuclear weapon, many experts believe that Pyongyang is using its capabilities as a bargaining chip rather than for an actual attack. But Trump\u2019s irresponsible threats to meet North Korea with \u201cfire and fury,\u201d coupled with reports of the then-candidate asking foreign-policy advisers why he can\u2019t use nukes, have policymakers concerned.\n\nEven during the Cold War, when bluster of war was at its highest, no one at the Kremlin or the White House was as reckless or deemed nearly as incompetent as Trump. Most Soviet and U.S. leaders have had a healthy respect for nuclear weapons. The Cuban missile crisis, the closest two nations have come to nuclear war, saw President John Kennedy and USSR Premier Nikita Khrushchev come to a peaceful resolution after 13 days of gut-wrenching negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s advancements in ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads have come faster than expected. Once Pyongyang gets warhead re-entry down, it\u2019ll have completed the full process of becoming a nuclear state.\n\nPresidents over the past two decades have tried diplomacy to slow North Korea\u2019s program, to no avail. Bill Clinton\u2019s administration came close to ending North Korea\u2019s program with a package that included nonproliferating reactors and natural gas, but Washington politics killed it. George W. Bush placed North Korea on his \u201caxis of evil,\u201d essentially giving diplomacy little chance at all to succeed. Barack Obama\u2019s efforts failed, too.\n\nDuring none of those years did America worry about the White House stoking tensions with unnecessary rhetoric as Trump does, forcing even some Republicans to ask if the president\u2019s nuclear powers need to be curtailed. Indeed, even if Congress votes in favor of stripping the president of sole authority of pre-emptive first-strike power, it still will not address the most important problem: that nukes exist in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s say if, for some reason, Congress approves legislation restricting the president from calling a pre-emptive nuclear strike (for the record, this is very unlikely). That still can\u2019t stop the president from ordering his generals to do so, because the president is commander in chief, not Congress.\n\n\u201cA lawyer may say, \u2018Mr. President, if you execute that option, that may be illegal and we can have the trial in the bunker after the nuclear war,\u2019\u201d Jeffery Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too negative about the bill[s] because we should be talking about it. I just do not know if the bill[s] will ultimately solve our problem.\u201d\n\nAny bill aimed at checking any president\u2019s power to call for a pre-emptive strike (which is not the same as calling for a defensive response) is a legitimate debate. The issue is that it does not solve the problem, simply because the nuclear option is available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lawmakers craft legislation challenging the president\u2019s singular power to call for a nuclear strike, even more efforts need to be invested into reducing nuclear weapons altogether.\n\nAs late as the end of the 1980s, there were more 70,000 nuclear warheads in existence, mostly between Russia and the United States. Now there are around 15,000. Reasonable Republican and Democratic presidents have cut away at stockpiles over the decades, with Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush disposing of most of them; Bill Clinton comes in at No. 3 for cutting the nuclear stockpile during a presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s dangerous warmongering certainly raises the stakes in any debate about the need to curtail a president\u2019s power to call for nuclear war, but this is bigger than any one person. So while the lawmakers and critics rightfully fight to curtail the president\u2019s power to destroy human civilization, we should also pressure Congress to engage in diplomacy to chip away at America\u2019s and Russia\u2019s stockpiles so that one day, we won\u2019t have to deal with this problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the idea of nuclear weapons in Donald Trump\u2019s tiny little hands frightens you, it might be that you don\u2019t like nuclear weapons all that much,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cMaybe the issue here is not Trump with nuclear weapons.

Key members of his administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and his own White House chief of staff, John Kelly, disagree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo help us understand what is at stake, The Root spoke with three nuclear weapons and regional security experts to break down how important this deal is and what could happen if Trump decertifies it.\n\nWhat exactly is the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nOfficially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran deal was negotiated in 2015 to ensure that Tehran\u2019s nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes. Over the years, Iran has been hit with stiff economic and political sanctions from the United Nations, United States, European Union and others because it was engaged in enriching uranium and other proliferation activities that would help it make a nuclear weapon. The ban included arms exports, bank account freezes against key individuals and companies, and bans on Iranian oil and natural gas exports. Keep in mind nuclear-specific sanctions are not the same as other forms of sanctions against the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sanctions caused economic pains on Iran, which harms the country\u2019s general population.\n\nIndefinite isolation, former President Barack Obama believed, was not the best approach to punishing Iran. So he decided to make a hard choice: Face a nuclear Iran in a few years and have to deal with the Iranians as well as a nuclear North Korea, or make a tough deal that was bound to piss off most of the hawks in the GOP and regional U.S. allies who have legitimate grievances about Tehran destabilizing their countries by supporting terrorism. The logic was that if America has to face Iran in a military standoff, Tehran would not have nuclear weapons at its disposal\u2014unlike North Korea.\n\nEvery 90 days, the U.S. president has to certify that Iran is honoring the deal. Trump certified the deal earlier this year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho does the deal help?\n\nIt depends on whom you ask. Generally, the thinking is that Iran is a bad regional player that is already menacing its neighbors by supporting Hezbollah. Hezbollah has supported rebels in Yemen, sent fighters to Syria and trainers to Iraq. It is also the nemesis of Israel, America\u2019s top ally in the region.\n\nIran is causing plenty of regional problems with conventional weapons and well-funded terrorism. If it has nuclear weapons, Tehran will be even more of a problem because, if it has to, it can always threaten to nuke its enemy out of existence. If, say, Israel struck nuclear facilities in Iran, that would still cause a chain reaction in which Tehran could deploy fighters throughout the region to destabilize it. It would be a terror campaign that would never end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea behind the Iran nuclear deal is to get Tehran to see the benefits of engaging the global community. Over time, the hope is that its leadership will lose interest in a nuclear program.\n\nSaeid Golkar, a nonresident scholar for Iran policy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said another less-discussed factor is that many young Iranians are very pro-American and support the deal\u2019s framework\u2014even though Americans did not do much to earn their respect, he added.\n\n\u201cDuring Obama\u2019s presidency, because of his behavior towards Iran, he was more popular than Trump because of the travel ban and his undermining of the deal,\u201d Golkar said. \u201cRight now, there is a very [combative attitude] towards the U.S., but generally Iranians are still very pro-American. Because they are afraid of the strain the sanctions will impose on Iran, which will lead to a harsh economic situation and high inflation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho loses out on the deal?\n\nPretty much every one of Iran\u2019s enemies. The deal may ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, but it does nothing to punish Tehran for sponsoring terrorism and destabilizing the region.\n\nAsha Castleberry\u2014a national security expert who served as the Kuwait desk officer for international military affairs, U.S. Army Central, for 30 months during her 10-year career\u2014said the Obama administration decided to settle with Iran by letting it continue to support such groups in exchange for its not having a nuclear program. She brought up the example of North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whose country has an estimated 20 nuclear weapons or 60, depending on whose estimates you use. Negotiating with a nuclear enemy is far tougher than dealing with a nonnuclear one, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, some of Iran\u2019s neighbors were opposed to the deal for very legitimate reasons.\n\n\u201cIn their neighborhood, they feel they are being threatened by proxy groups that are supposedly funded by Iran,\u201d Castleberry said. \u201cIn the south of Saudi Arabia, you have Iran propping up the Al Houthis in Yemen that are a threat to [Riyadh]. In Syria, you have Iran working with the Bashar al-Assad regime forces that are also a threat to Saudi Arabia. Then you have them working with Hezbollah, that\u2019s a threat to Saudi Arabia and Israel and other places. So, yes, in their eyes, [the Iran deal] is uncomfortable and something they did not want because they felt Iran was going to use that money [that would be freed after sanctions dropped] to support those groups.\u201d\n\nWhat happens if Trump decertifies the deal?\n\nCongress will have up to 60 days to decide if it will restore pre-Iran-deal sanctions against Tehran. If Congress does slap Tehran with sanctions, that would technically violate the deal, and Iran could pull out and resume its nuclear weapons program. But that likely will not happen. As Michael Wilner over at FiveThirtyEight notes, the likely approach Congress will take is a symbolic vote against Iran without jeopardizing the practical functions of the deal.\n\nSo, what, then, does Trump have to gain from pulling out of the deal? Optics.\n\n\u201cA lot of it\u2019s perception,\u201d said Bonnie D. Jenkins, former U.S. ambassador for threat-reductions programs. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t like a lot of stuff that Obama has done, so there doesn\u2019t have to be a lot of rationale for what he does. His rationale is that this is something that is associated with Obama, so he\u2019s trying to find a way to get out of the [Iran deal], but he doesn\u2019t have the evidence to do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother point is that Trump does not have unilateral power to dismantle the deal, either, since the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany are all parties to the deal, too. Even if the U.S. wants to play the rogue player, the rest of the parties can maintain their commitments to the deal without disrupting its main purpose: to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cThe agreement won\u2019t end because the U.S. decides not to certify it, Jenkins, an Obama appointee, said.\n\nWill the U.S. and Iran go to war?\n\nNo one with common sense wants that. Of course, Trump has neither common sense nor an appreciation for how limited American options are in the region. Indeed, the U.S. military is the best in the world, and could defeat Iranian forces in a conventional war situation. The problem is that it would never be a military-to-military scenario that some will neatly map out in their minds (think Iraq). Besides deploying Hezbollah forces and other terror groups against U.S. forces, Iran would be no cakewalk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIran is not Iraq. It is not Afghanistan. It\u2019s much bigger. Much stronger militarily, and it is very difficult to fight in Iran,\u201d Golkar said. \u201cYou cannot change the Iranian regime because as soon as you fire the first missile in Iran, the people will support the regime. [A military strike] will help the regime consolidate the power and suppress any kind of reform. Nationalists will rally behind the regime and they will have a good alibi: \u2018We reached a deal and the United States just threw it away.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal is not perfect. America has very limited options in the region, which makes conservatives hungry for war unhappy. But it is the best option Washington, D.C., has. With the State Department in disarray and the chance that Tillerson may not be in his position for long, a stable deal needs to be in place. Washington doesn\u2019t need the stress of dealing with a nuclear North Korea and a nuclear Iran.\n\nCastleberry added that neither Trump nor the GOP has better ideas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not proposing a better alternative,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the problem with him and the Republicans. If we have a deal with Iran that stops them from building a nuclear weapons program and you want to get rid of it, give me a better alternative that can stop them. They don\u2019t have one.

Carruth wanted Adams to have an abortion and she refused, so Carruth paid men to kill her.\n\nAdams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth had set her up. Adams\u2019 unborn son would survive but was born with cerebral palsy. Carruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison, and Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, has raised her grandson, Chancellor Lee Adams, from birth until now. He\u2019s 18. He\u2019s doing fine. He knows he has a dad.

You can read it below:\n\nThankfully, because God is still guiding the way, no matter how much hatred the Trump administration spouts, Carruth now knows that staying out of his son\u2019s life is the best move. Last month, Carruth wrote a 16-page self-serving apology that he sent to a television station, claiming that his son\u2019s grandmother had been spreading false stories about him.

Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what?

Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back.

On Thursday, he confirmed that Carson had changed his mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the about-face comes after Carson was widely criticized for the purchase, especially in light of the $6.8 billion in cuts his agency is facing.\n\nIn a statement about the purchase, Carson said, \u201cNobody was more surprised than me.\u201d\n\nSir, please.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral department officials told the Times on condition of anonymity that it would have been highly unusual for Carson to not be notified about the significant purchase and office-furniture upgrade.\n\nWilliams also claims that Candy Carson had no knowledge of the order, either, but this runs contrary to a whistleblower complaint from a former high-level staffer who said that Candy Carson pressured her to go around the $5,000 legal limit for purchases in order to redecorate her husband\u2019s office.\n\nThe dining set was ordered Dec. 21 from a Baltimore company, and according to the Times, it will be hard to cancel the order. The federal government is also unlikely to recoup all its money even if the set is not delivered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams explained: \u201cHe\u2019s not returning the table; he is attempting to cancel the order. HUD is a bureaucracy, so everything is complicated. The person they contracted has already spent $14,000 making the table. While his intentions are to cancel it, we have to see what happens.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee sent a three-page letter asking for an explanation of the dining-set purchase because it likely violates a federal law that requires congressional approval for any office-renovation expense exceeding $5,000.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) also requested a response to the whistleblower complaint from Helen G. Foster, former HUD chief of administration, who said that she was demoted and transferred after she refused to comply with Candy Carson\u2019s request to circumvent the $5,000 spending cap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTL;DR: Ben Carson is full of shit. His wife is full of shit. They out here making black people look bad with their bullshit, and now they are trying to clean up the mess.\n\nNah.\n\nStand firm, Ben Carson.

There is no doubt about it, land shall be expropriated without compensation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of the South African Parliament members support moving the motion for land expropriation forward, it\u2019s been met with vehement opposition from a handful of parties: the Democratic Alliance; Freedom Front Plus, which represents white Afrikaners; COPE; and the African Christian Democratic Party.\n\nPieter Groenewald, leader of the Freedom Front Plus party, warned that seizing land from white landowners would lead to \u201cunforeseen consequences that is not in the interest of South Africa.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sentiment was put more forcefully by Ernst Roets, deputy chief executive of Afriforum, a minority-rights (read: white South African rights) organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoets said that the motion violated a 1994 agreement in which the ANC promised that the interests of minorities would be protected postapartheid.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Roets said that the motion was \u201cbased on a distorted image of the past\u201d and was \u201cnothing more than racist theft\u201d\u2014kind of like colonization, one supposes.\n\nHe went on to say that it wasn\u2019t true that \u201cwhite people who own land necessarily obtained it by means of oppression, violence or forced removals.\u201d Apparently there was a huge \u201cbuy one, get 71 percent more of South Africa\u2019s total farmland\u201d sale that we missed in the history books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics of the move cite the Zimbabwe government\u2019s purge of white landowners as an example of why the policy won\u2019t work. As Quartz notes, Zimbabwe is currently looking into ways that it can compensate the dispossessed white, former commercial farmers whose land was seized by the government 18 years ago.

Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said.

Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free.

We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S.

The claims of these 19 women run the gamut from unwanted touching to unwanted kissing, and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, a champion of women\u2019s rights and reportedly her father\u2019s moral compass on these issues, believes her father when he says that all of these women\u2014all 19 of them\u2014are lying.\n\n\u201cI believe my father,\u201d Ivanka Trump said Sunday in an exclusive interview with NBC News, claiming that the question posed to her was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know my father. So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father,\u201d she said.\n\nI\u2019m unclear how Ivanka Trump believes that the question was inappropriate. She\u2019s in the White House because her father wanted her there. She prides herself on being a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d who helps her father make difficult moral decisions.

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["teachers", "forward", "program", "school", "moving", "especially", "students", "educators", "gun", "armed", "dangerous", "laws", "black", "legislature", "children", "approved", "florida", "schools"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["solved", "im", "plan", "crime", "right", "nra", "racist", "donald", "lives", "trump", "gun", "white", "black", "stuff", "think", "know", "matter"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Loesch said some really crazy shit.\n\n\u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,\u201d Loesch said Thursday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back [of the room].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd notice I said \u2018crying white mothers,\u2019 because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don\u2019t see town halls for them, do you?\u201d Loesch asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the CNN town hall for Chicago? Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["shes", "loesch", "spokeswoman", "chicago", "nra", "love", "town", "media", "shootings", "gun", "white", "loves", "mothers", "mass", "ratings", "gold"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law professor quoted in the Raw Story article, said, state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Story also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet-fuel-tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans had threatened to pull their support.\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, also responded to Cagle, criticizing the lieutenant governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon.com\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time magazine, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["raw", "delta", "nra", "tax", "biggest", "governor", "hes", "young", "threatening", "states", "wannabe", "loves", "state", "lawmakers", "second", "georgia", "employers", "cagle", "discounts"], "polarity": -0.020344635523206957, "subjectivity": 0.356445043052186},

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter.

Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["legal", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras", "terrorist", "deaths", "second", "directly", "organization", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins?

It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["law", "health", "ranks", "celebrate", "nra", "mental", "enforcement", "gov", "proposed", "scott", "school", "weapons", "trump", "gun", "shouldnt", "yes", "florida", "rick"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["notes", "care", "teacher", "listening", "massshooting", "check", "going", "trump", "white", "violent", "president", "victims", "teachers", "house", "remember", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn.

He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him.

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim.

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["guns", "youre", "day", "nra", "shooting", "trump", "gun", "white", "black", "person", "age", "matter", "convention", "shot"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["presidents", "save", "shooter", "school", "hes", "trump", "run", "president", "bunch", "afraid", "likely", "kids"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

Mueller has taken a keen interest in Trump\u2019s belittling of Sessions. Specifically, Mueller wants to know if Trump has been attempting to drive Sessions from his job and whether that is part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller\u2019s team has reportedly questioned witnesses in recent months about Trump\u2019s comments and state of mind when he wrote negative tweets about Sessions in July and August of last year.\n\nWas Trump trying to push Sessions out so he could appoint someone else who could control the Russia investigation?

That\u2019s the lowest monthly average for any yearlong period since at least 2000; under President Obama, the same sections together averaged more than a half-dozen cases a month. Cases begin when the Justice Department starts investigating whether a person or organization violated the law. Following the investigation, DOJ attorneys send a letter or complaint detailing the allegations against them and their findings. For example, after Freddie Gray\u2019s death in Baltimore police custody in 2015, the division initiated an investigation into the department, which resulted in a findings letter the next year. Another way to measure the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights enforcement activity is to look at legal agreements reached with people, companies, and organizations accused of discrimination. These agreements are one of the most common ways a case ends, and they typically come with fines or concessions. In Baltimore, the Justice Department imposed a court-monitored consent decree that listed goals for the police to meet before it could be lifted. Under Trump, the division has reached about six of these kinds of agreements per month, on average, the fewest since at least 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017 the Justice Department announced that it would be reviewing 2017\u2019s white supremacist violence and protests in Charlottesville, Va., but provided little information about where the investigation is now. Good money is on the Department of Justice finding that there are good people on both sides and that the tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists are really misunderstood, good kids just finding their way.\n\nVice News notes that a spokesman for the DOJ refused to provide the number of active investigations being pursued by the department.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to say,\u201d Lhamon told Vice News. \u201cWhat are they hiding?\u201d\n\nWell, for one, Sessions has yet to explain how, after all of these years, he and several of his workers have been able to make delicious cookies in a fucking tree, so there is that. It should shock no one that this administration is less concerned with the treatment of minorities, immigration rights or employment litigation\u2014all areas handled by the DOJ.

Even with multiple states legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. attorney general has made it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws.\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court.

Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry.

While the government claims that pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003 to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing: \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too.

Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

COPS also made reform recommendations to troubled departments and provided guidance and technical support.\n\nOne such department was the San Francisco Police Department.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech.

She began taking medical marijuana three years ago, and her seizures disappeared. Newsweek reports that Alexis filed a lawsuit against Sessions last fall because he has made it his mission to impede access to the one drug that has been able to help her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case goes before a judge in a New York City federal court on Feb. 14. Attorney Michael Hiller will be there to represent Alexis, and he told Newsweek that he believes the ruling will go their way.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that the case is going to come out the way it should, which is that the Controlled Substances Act is going to be found unconstitutional,\u201d Hiller told the magazine.\n\nTheir case involves several other plaintiffs, including a former professional football player, a veteran and another child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe seizures Alexis suffered were so bad that her family moved from Texas to Colorado so she could have access to products made with marijuana.\n\nThere is science that supports the evidence that Alexis is experiencing relief with cannabis products.

To that end, the DOJ ended an effort put in place by the Obama administration to investigate and publicize police department shortcomings.\n\nAs a result, 14 police departments nationwide that had either received reports from the DOJ\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services or were waiting to receive reports were left dangling in the wind. COPS also made reform recommendations to troubled departments and provided guidance and technical support.\n\nOne such department was the San Francisco Police Department. After a six-month investigation of the SFPD in 2016, COPS found disparities in traffic stops, post-stop searches and use of deadly force against African Americans, as well as implicit and institutionalized bias against minority groups.\n\nCOPS released its findings in a 432-page report and made nearly 300 recommendations for reform, which it would have overseen if not for Sessions\u2019 ending of the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the absence of DOJ oversight, the California Department of Justice announced Monday that it will oversee the efforts of SFPD to implement the reforms suggested by COPS, Mother Jones reports.\n\nAt a press conference, San Francisco\u2019s interim Mayor Mark Farrell said, \u201cWe made a promise to our residents and to our communities that we were going to transform our Police Department\u2014and partnering with [California] Attorney General [Xavier] Becerra will allow us to follow through on that pledge.\u201d\n\nThe COPS investigation of SFPD was prompted by the shooting death of Mario Woods at the hands of San Francisco police in December 2015. The investigation looked into six areas, identified 94 findings and provided 272 recommendations for improvement within the Police Department.

In addition, COPS suggested that the use-of-force policies in place for the department were out-of-date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMother Jones reports that current San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said the department has already made progress on more than half of the recommended changes, including banning officers from shooting at moving vehicles and approving a plan to equip police with Tasers. The state will now evaluate the department\u2019s progress and issue regular public reports.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all anyone wants, right? Police accountability is important.

Her job as a mouthpiece for the NRA is to shift the focus from looking at gun laws to looking at anything but gun laws.\n\nSeriously, she doesn\u2019t care if the focus goes from the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to the county sheriff\u2019s department, which she tried to accomplish during a CNN town hall. She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well. Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Loesch said some really crazy shit.\n\n\u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,\u201d Loesch said Thursday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back [of the room].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd notice I said \u2018crying white mothers,\u2019 because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don\u2019t see town halls for them, do you?\u201d Loesch asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the CNN town hall for Chicago? Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["shes", "loesch", "spokeswoman", "chicago", "nra", "love", "town", "media", "shootings", "gun", "white", "loves", "mothers", "mass", "ratings", "gold"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["notes", "care", "teacher", "listening", "massshooting", "check", "going", "trump", "white", "violent", "president", "victims", "teachers", "house", "remember", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well?

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States? Nope.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer.

Karen Bass (D-Calif.) completely dismantled U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Bass questioned why the FBI would be investigating and writing reports on \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d labeling them as a threat against the police, but not writing those same reports and conducting those same investigations on the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\n\nBass started out by asking the chairperson of the committee to allow her to enter into the record the recent FBI report \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.\u201d Sessions told Bass that he had not read the report, but he knew about some of the alleged targeting of officers by \u201ccertain groups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he could get into his line of bullshit on it, Bass asked him who in his department had the power to order the report to be put together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that report got ordered,\u201d Sessions said weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I explicitly approved it or directed it.\u201d\n\n[So you\u2019re in charge, but you have no idea how something like this could come about? OK, sir.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d]\n\n\u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d\n\nBass cut him off.\n\n\u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question. It\u2019s easy to label black people who fight for racial justice and racism as the actual racists when we know that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t follow that question,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPlease again?\u201d\n\nBass then asked her question even more directly than she did the first time: \u201cIs there a term or a report on white identity extremists? You mentioned you are familiar with black people who identify with their racial identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not coming to me at this moment.\u201d\n\n[OK, sir. You can\u2019t remember the name of ONE white extremist group? Really, former senator of Alabama? Not ONE? OK.]\n\nBass was incredulous: \u201cNot coming to you?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t about to let Sessions off the hook that easily.\n\n\u201cCertainly a group such as the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d she said, in an attempt to jog his memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seemed to work. Suddenly Sessions remembered. \u201cYes, and then the skinhead movements, but there is racial identity white movements that have been identified for sure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo has the FBI done a report on white identity extremists that are likely motivated to target law-enforcement officers?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[So, no. Just say that, sir. You haven\u2019t. You haven\u2019t because you are OK with white extremist groups.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCould you name an African-American organization that has committed violent acts against police officers? Could you name one today? In this report, they name organizations from 30 or 40 years ago, but can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?\u201d Bass asked.\n\nGotcha! Sessions waffled and could not name any such organization, because as we all know, that is some extreme bullshit.\n\n\u201cI believe I could, but I would want to be, um, to confirm that and submit it to you in writing, but I believe we had in the last year or so four police officers killed by a group that some have described as extremist,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was referring to the shooting in Dallas or perhaps in Baton Rouge, La., that they tried to tie to Black Lives Matter, but we all know that was some bullshit, too.\n\nBass cut to the chase and asked the most necessary question, because we know exactly whom the FBI were talking about and whom they were targeting when they put out that fake-ass report.\n\n\u201cWould you consider Black Lives Matter a black identity extremist group?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to comment on that. I have not so declared it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAgain, Bass put out there what all of us have been thinking since that ridiculous report made the news, saying:\n\nSo, you should know that a lot of activists around the country are very concerned that we\u2019re getting ready to repeat a very sad chapter of our history, where people who are rightfully protesting what they consider to be an injustice in their community\u2014which is their relationship with police officers\u2014are now being targeted and labeled as extremists and are going through periods of surveillance and harassment, and so I would like to know, what is your department going to do to protect the rights of average citizens to protest if they have a concern about police officers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was quick to go on the offensive.\n\n\u201cThis department will not unlawfully target people,\u201d he said.\n\nBass then said:\n\nSo, if that\u2019s the case then, I would ask that you review this report\u2014\u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d\u2014because I personally don\u2019t believe that any such organizations exist. The organizations that are referred to in this report are organizations from decades ago, so I would like to know what will you do to essentially roll back what is listed in this report? Because it\u2019s not accurate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a pregnant pause while Sessions considered what lie he should let fly out of his mouth next.\n\nHe then said, \u201cWe will look at the report. I\u2019d actually be interested in reading it. But they usually do an excellent job\u2014objective and fair\u2014on those kind of reports.\u201d\n\n[Objective and fair? OK, Bilbo Bigot.]\n\nBass did a great job ripping into Sessions and getting him to basically admit that the \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d report was full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Lives Matter and other social groups that are fighting for racial equality and calling out the deaths of black men at the hands of police are not a threat to law enforcement. That is the narrative Sessions has been driving, however, since he took the job as attorney general. Enough is enough.\n\nSalute to Karen Bass.

Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it.

But I found the strange Facebook response of \u2018Oprah 2020' weirdly discordant and disorienting. Oprah\u2019s speech \u2014 in my hearing \u2014 wasn\u2019t about why she needs to run for office.

In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it.

What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media.

Attorney General Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions\u2019 federal investigation into the torch-wielding white supremacist march on Charlottesville, Va., is going to be an inconclusive waste of resources and efforts.\n\nIn fact, when I first learned that Sessions was going to open an investigation, I joked that he was probably going to research why the nonviolent protesters who were rallying against hate weren\u2019t at home, or work or someplace else. He\u2019s probably going to investigate whether marching in the streets could lead to federal charges and how he can enact a \u201cbody barricade law\u201d against those who were struck by the rogue Dodge driven by a terrorist.\n\n\n\nThe idea that a world-renowned racist whose legacy is so mired in racism that even Coretta Scott King hated him (quick\u2014name one other person that Coretta Scott King hated. I\u2019ll wait) is going to investigate white supremacists is almost laughable. At the time of this writing, no one inside the administration has called this violence by name. No one has denounced the connection between white supremacy and the White House. In fact, Republican Congress members have urged the president to come out against this domestic terrorism, and he refuses because this is his base.\n\nSo when Sessions announced Sunday that \u201cthe violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,\u201d I called bullshit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Keebler, TrumpPutin and Steve \u201cBig Papa\u201d Bannon are the wheels in the tricycle of hate. They allow, push, perpetuate, encourage and support this kind of racist hatred. In fact, the president couldn\u2019t even take a moment to distinguish between those rallying against hate and those who were there to support it. It isn\u2019t difficult to find the words. Everyone outside this administration has found a way to stand on the right side of this, even if it\u2019s just for appearance\u2019s sake.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated,\u201d Sessions added, Politico reports. \u201cI have talked with FBI Director Chris Wray, FBI agents on the scene and law-enforcement officials for the state of Virginia. The FBI has been supporting state and local authorities throughout the day. U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has commenced a federal investigation and will have the full support of the Department of Justice. Justice will prevail.\u201d\n\nNo, it won\u2019t, and in all honesty, nothing from this administration besides hatred of others seems to ring true. I don\u2019t believe Sessions. I don\u2019t believe TrumPutin. I will never believe Big Papa Bannon\u2014unless, of course, they are centering whiteness and hating others. Then I believe them wholeheartedly. This is who the members of this administration have shown themselves to be. They are not only aligned with white supremacy; they are white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Sessions claims that such actions \u201cbetray our core values and cannot be tolerated\u201d; that he\u2019s talked with law enforcement, from the FBI to local officials; and that a U.S. attorney has the full support of the Department of Justice, I call bullshit.\n\nTime will move this tragedy into the back of the American consciousness, and the investigation will turn up more of nothing. In the end, the white men who stormed Virginia wielding tiki torches, some of whom were dressed like their grand wizard on vacation, will not be held accountable.

To white America, the flag is a quasi-religious symbol that should always be revered in the manner for which it was intended.\n\n\n\nExcept, of course, when it comes to what they do regarding it.\n\nOn Sunday, Tomi Lahren, Fox News commentator and poster child for how the Caucasian standard of beauty transcends mediocre whiteness, shared her red-white-and-blue concoction of a Halloween costume with her Instagram followers.\n\nThe outfit was either a reimagining of Apollo Creed\u2019s Rocky wardrobe or a mangled U.S. flag stolen from the wet dreams of Donald Trump supporters. It was also disrespectful as fuck to Betsy Ross, the troops and the white men who get sentimentally and sexually semierect at the sight of the star-spangled banner.\n\nMake no mistake about it\u2014according to the narrative of the people whose eyes spontaneously transform into white-tears-sprinkling systems when they hear that Colin Kaepernick had the audacity to kneel during the unfurling of the dear old American flag\u2014the respect-the-flag controversy is rooted in the U.S. flag code, which states:\n\nDuring the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in review, all persons present in uniform should render the military salute. Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present but not in uniform may render the military salute. All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart, or if applicable, remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the only basis for the claim that kneeling during the anthem and simultaneous flag display is offensive, and according to these standards, they are correct. Kneeling during the flag is a violation of the standards set by the flag code.\n\nHowever, in the section titled, \u201cRespect for the Flag,\u201d the code states: \u201cThe flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.\u201d It later adds that \u201cno part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform.\u201d\n\nI know you\u2019re thinking that Tomi Lahren\u2019s costume, when held to the same standards as protesting NFL players, is disrespectful by any definition. After all, if we arbitrarily applied rules to black athletes but excused vapid white windbags, wouldn\u2019t that be the definition of inequality and prejudice?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you are wrong. You are conveniently forgetting the one supreme caveat that makes your argument automatically moot:\n\nTomi Lahren is a white woman.\n\nLocks of platinum and breasts render irrelevant the rules that apply to the untittied nonblond masses. Unlike the masses, they get to do whatever they want. Whiteness is a trump card that exempts them from the same scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey can point out the death toll in Chicago during the weekend but remain silent about the parade of mass shooters who make the Windy City\u2019s \u201ctop gang thugs\u201d look like amateurs. They talk about welfare while blithely ignoring the fact that white people make up 40 percent of food stamp recipients. They don\u2019t mention that white women are the biggest beneficiaries of quotas when they rail against affirmative action.\n\nSo if you think Tomi Lahren should apologize for her disrespect for the flag, you are sorely mistaken. She gets to do it. White people get to do it. Her costume was simply a fun way of expressing her love for her fellow Trump-supporting white people Americans, while the black players\u2019 demonstrations were a way of expressing their love for their fellow shot-in-the-face, disenfranchised, oppressed Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the difference?\n\nWe can only hope that one day that star-spangled banner will represent equality for black people in the same way that it waves o\u2019er the unaccomplished, alternative-fact mouth farts of the fired-on-her-day-off, shit-for-brains Barbie we call Tomi Lahren.\n\n... \u201cand the hoooome of the braaave.\u201d", "keywords": ["render", "costume", "tomi", "whiteness", "highlights", "flag", "present", "lahrens", "disrespectful", "white", "hypocrisy", "black", "lahren", "way", "standards"], "polarity": 0.009821428571428573, "subjectivity": 0.3434523809523809},

This is the practice that allows law enforcement to take your cash, cars, home and any other property away from you if you are suspected of a crime. No conviction is necessary, and you don\u2019t even have to be a drug dealer to be a target.\n\nLast month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced his renewed love affair with the \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d He seems to specifically be targeting marijuana, which is being made legal in state after state across the country. No matter, Sessions sees it as a huge problem in our country, and he has appointed a task force to review the link between marijuana and violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever mind that the most violent crime I have ever committed while high on marijuana was against a bag of Trader Joe\u2019s Kettle Corn that I demolished in one sitting (and no, I am not ashamed). Sessions believes that weed\u2014not cocaine, not heroin, not methamphetamine\u2014has a direct link to violence.\n\nAt the same time that Sessions began to target weed, he announced that he was reinstating the adoptive forfeiture program, a program that had previously been abolished by the Obama administration, which allows local law enforcement to circumvent state laws and take the assets and property of people suspected of a crime under more lax federal laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the adoptive forfeiture program, law enforcement agencies that take cash, cars, homes and property from \u201csuspected\u201d criminals get to keep 80 percent of it for themselves as profit, and they hand over 20 percent to the federal government.\n\nIt is a very lucrative source of income for law enforcement; in the 12 months before then-Attorney General Eric Holder shut down the program in 2015, local authorities took in $65 million, which they shared with the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn defense of the program, Sessions said, \u201cCivil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels.\u201d\n\nSo if the idea is to defund organized crime, prevent new crimes from being committed, and weaken criminals and cartels, why are we going after low-level marijuana dealers and poor people?\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, there is evidence that forfeiture efforts tend to target poor neighborhoods, and although defenders of the practice claim that it is necessary to disrupt major criminal organizations, a 2015 report from the Institute for Justice (pdf) showed that between 1997 and 2013, 87 percent of Justice Department forfeitures did not require a criminal charge or conviction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake, for example, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nDaniel Honchariw of the Nevada Policy Research Institute recently released a report (pdf) that reviewed the LVMPD\u2019s forfeiture activities for the fiscal year 2016. NPRI analyzed 346 forfeiture cases and, using information provided by the Nevada attorney general and public records requests, found that the Police Department collected $1.9 million via asset forfeiture in 2016.\n\nOf the 346 cases analyzed:\n\n56 percent involved cash or other assets valued at $1,000 or less.\n\n28 of the cases involved $100 or less.\n\n13 of the cases involved $20 or less.\n\nTwo cases involved $1 or less.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nEither these are some pretty cheap cartels and criminal organizations, or what the policy is supposed to do and what is actually happening are two different things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNPRI also found that 66 percent of the forfeitures occurred in the same 12 zip codes in Las Vegas, zip codes in which the neighborhoods consist mainly of minorities and low-income residents. There are 48 zip codes total in Las Vegas. The average poverty rate in the 12 targeted zip codes is 27 percent, compared with the countywide (Clark County) poverty rate of 16 percent. For contrast, the average poverty rate in the other 36 zip codes is 12 percent.\n\nNPRI rightly suggests that the practice of forfeiture is regressive in nature and targets the poorest, most racially diverse areas of Clark County, where the individuals lack the knowledge and resources to effectively combat it.\n\nNPRI also suggests that the practice be abolished and replaced with one that requires a criminal conviction in all cases. This suggestion is right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions isn\u2019t fooling anyone. By going after marijuana, a low-level drug, and people in poor neighborhoods, he is demonstrating his desire to keep his foot on the neck of poor people, black and brown.\n\nIf the true intention were to go after cartels, we wouldn\u2019t see asset forfeiture in poor neighborhoods, because members of cartels aren\u2019t living there. If the feds were going after cartels, then the NPRI would not be able to show that the lowest-valued asset forfeiture in Las Vegas amounted to just 74 cents.\n\nThis is your tax dollars at work.

The BBC and HuffPost reported on the letter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let a fat black swine from Africa meddle in the lives of the French,\u201d the letter began.\n\nMore of the letter, from HuffPost:\n\nYour media appearances make us sick.

As HuffPost notes, in using the hashtag, the 32-year-old member of Parliament expanded its meaning, leading others to apply it to racial violence as well as gender violence.\n\nAvia received widespread support across the French government and from thousands of people on social media after her post.

When I was 11 years old, I was sitting in a room filled with black men at my uncle\u2019s New Jersey apartment. As they joked around with one another in the bawdy way men are apt to do when they\u2019re by themselves, a traditionally attractive white woman popped up on the television screen.\n\nAfter one of the guys said something about how fine she was, my uncle replied, \u201cBoy, don\u2019t mess with white women. You know they will Emmett Till yo\u2019 ass!\u201d Everyone burst out laughing except me. I had no idea why that joke was remotely funny, but when I got home I looked up the name \u201cEmmett Till\u201d in a World Book Encyclopedia.\n\nI saw the pictures. There was no nuance and very little detail in the 400-word entry (I wouldn\u2019t know that some people believed the white woman in the case had lied until a few years later), but I distinctly remember the fact that the article mentioned how they tied him to the fan of a cotton gin before they threw him in the river.\n\nI was 11 years old. I was a black boy. I couldn\u2019t swim. I lived in the rural Deep South on a dusty road. My family home was across the street from a cotton gin.\n\nI do not hate white women. I am afraid of them.\n\nPoliticon\u2014the political convention that seeks to do for political figures what Comic-Con has done for nerds\u2014held the heavyweight championship of Beckying with a debate between Chelsea Handler and Tomi Lahren this past weekend. (Don\u2019t sleep on Handler\u2014who is as problematic as Lahren in different ways\u2014just because you like her politics.) The only reason anyone would call the entire spectacle even remotely interesting is that skinny, blond white women are always graded on a curve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the only thing any news outlet has mentioned about the much-hyped spectacle is that Lahren\u2014the conservative firebrand, right-leaning, Barack Obama-hating enemy of the Affordable Care Act\u2014is currently on Obamacare.\n\nBefore Obamacare, a parent could not carry a child on his or her insurance after the child reached the age of 19, so some outlets are reporting that Lahren is \u201cbenefiting from\u201d Obamacare because she is still on her parents\u2019 insurance. That is being generous. The Affordable Care Act is not an insurance plan; it is simply a set of laws that govern insurance and set up health care exchanges. But if there is such a thing as \u201cbeing on\u201d Obamacare, Lahren is on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being on Obamacare. It is not for poor people. Before the ACA, it was hard for entrepreneurs, college students and people who worked part time to get medical insurance. Lahren is exactly who Obamacare was created for. Every time Broke Becky (I bet she collects unemployment, too) gets her Pap smear, she has the black president to thank, except she has spent her entire professional career standing in front of a white lynch mob and pointing her finger, trying to kill Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid of white women.\n\nThey will ask you to don a pink hat and march with them. They will readily paint themselves as allies, or as fellow oppressed people. They will convince you that they are in your corner. They will show you how white feminism intersects with racism. They will explain how white male patriarchy has always been the problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen they will slide behind the voting curtain and pull the lever for Donald Trump. They will call the police because you looked like you didn\u2019t belong there. They will say you raped them because they missed their curfew. They will stand and watch men tie your baby boy to a cotton gin fan and toss him in the river. They will keep their lies a secret for 50 years.\n\nThat level of duplicitous evil is scarier than any horror movie or demon story could ever inspire. I\u2019m not saying all white women are like this, but it is demonstrably true that any white woman could do this. At least a few of them have. We saw 53 percent of them do it.\n\nYou might think it hyperbolic to compare Emmett Till\u2019s accuser to Tomi Lahren, and you are right. Tomi Lahren and the people who pitch lies to uninformed white people for their own monetary or political advantage will ultimately be responsible for more deaths than Carolyn Bryant Donham\u2019s lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLahren is like the white people who rail against the mothers who use food stamps to feed their children but are cool with the Caucasians benefiting from corporate tax loopholes, farm subsidies and Medicare. She is the particular brand of feminist who will talk about the women\u2019s wage gap and the glass ceiling but will remain silent when she finds out she makes more than her black co-worker. They hate affirmative action but benefit from it the most.\n\nLahren is just one of many white women who are willing to flash their flawless smiles as they stare directly into your eyes and make their lies sound like violin music. They have learned to use their white-girl magic to create the illusion that they are not practitioners of sorcery while they ride their brooms off into the sunset. They profit off privilege while warning others about the dangers of trading in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not hate serpents or pit bulls; I am afraid of them.

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["watch", "sessions", "america", "law", "enforcement", "rates", "continues", "increase", "dishonest", "hook", "violent", "tour", "nearly", "crime", "safe", "drug"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

Jeff Sessions endorsed Donald Trump for president. At a campaign rally in Sessions\u2019 home state of Alabama, Sessions explained to the crowd that while \u201cwe don\u2019t get everything we want\u201d in a candidate, \u201cat this time, in my best judgment, at this time in America\u2019s history, we need to make America great again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was one of the first major Republican officials to embrace the campaign, which not only further legitimized it but also signaled to other Republicans in Congress to see the writing on the wall and embrace the movement happening before them.\n\n\n\nMore than a year and a half later, President Sweet Potato Saddam has returned the favor by publicly throwing Attorney General Segregation Now, Segregation Forever onto the MTA tracks to be run over (that is, if the raggedy-ass train ever arrives).\n\nIn his now infamous interview with the New York Times, the 45th president of the United States said:\n\nJeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president. ... How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, \u201cThanks, Jeff, but I\u2019m not going to take you.\u201d It\u2019s extremely unfair\u2014and that\u2019s a mild word\u2014to the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 45 went on to criticize Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, too, though Sessions suffered the most damage. Days following that New York Times interview, the Washington Post reported that Sessions discussed Trump\u2019s campaign-related matters with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Although 45 took to Twitter to lash out at the report, dubbing it \u201cFAKE NEWS,\u201d many have questioned the timing of the report\u2014speculating that someone from the White House, or perhaps 45 himself, leaked that information, which only a handful of people could have, known given its severity, in order to push Sessions out.\n\nHowever, regardless of who leaked the information, 45\u2019s interview alone has been enough to prompt White House staff to express alarm over the president trashing not only his own attorney general but also a man who took a risk in lending his political capital to his campaign.\n\nCNN reports:\n\nThere\u2019s also a general sense of bewilderment as to why Trump gave the interview. Health care was the focus of the day. He actually got engaged\u2014but then this. \u201cIt\u2019s chilling,\u201d one White House official said. Conversations with the official and one top Republican in frequent contact with the West Wing show a president who has long been angry with Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe, but rather than subsiding and moving on as Trump sometimes does, the anger has grown into a passionate rage. \u201cNo one was more loyal than Sessions. No one,\u201d a White House official said, speaking confidentially to avoid drawing the president\u2019s ire. Trump\u2019s trashing of several of his administration\u2019s top justice officials in an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is causing deep alarm inside the West Wing, leading some to worry that their loyalty to Trump might not be reciprocated from the man in the Oval Office. The thinking goes: If this could happen to Sessions, it could happen to anyone. One official described the president\u2019s blasting of Sessions as only intensifying the already low morale inside the West Wing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, duh.\n\nNot done with Sessions, 45 took another shot at him by referring to him as \u201cour beleaguered A.G.\u201d Perhaps he didn\u2019t have enough characters to say, \u201cI\u2019m the reason why our attorney general is beleaguered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen the man rolled his eyes when a reporter asked if Sessions should resign.\n\nTo those working in that administration wondering whether or not he\u2019ll do to them what he just did to Sessions, worry no longer: Yes, he is going to wrap you in bacon and throw you to the wolves. Moreover, it will presumably happen sooner rather than later.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk Sean Spicer, who may be currently pretending that it has been a duty and an honor to serve under this president as press secretary but is probably elated to soon be free of the torture that is working for the micromanager and pathological liar. On day 2 on the job, 45 had the man go out and throw a sass-filled fit over the lackluster crowd size for his inauguration. On day 3 he reportedly said of Spicer\u2019s appearance, \u201cHe was terrible.\u201d On day 5 he insulted his wardrobe, and by day 19 he was said to have already been looking for Spicer\u2019s replacement.\n\n\n\nWhen he decided to fire FBI head James Comey, he didn\u2019t bother to inform his press secretary. Not long after that, 45 met with Pope Francis and sent Spicer, a devout Catholic, home before he had the pleasure of meeting the head of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s senseless to compliment 45 for not firing Spicer. No, he didn\u2019t fire his press secretary, but he did micromanage him; coerce him, into telling lie after lie while quickly undermining his own communications staff by constantly shifting positions; humiliate him; and deprive him of the chance to meet a religious leader who directly speaks to his faith for no other reason than to be spiteful. In sum, he made his job impossible and unbearable and gave him numerous reasons to resign before he ultimately did so. Good luck with that, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nThe same goes for new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci will either irritate his boss for getting too much attention, not properly defending him to his liking or some combination of both. And knowing 45, who loves getting even with those he feels disrespected him, while Scaramucci may currently speak of y\u2019all\u2019s president as his latest, greatest inspiration, he did once write an op-ed condemning the tenets of the Trump campaign. If 45 will lash out at someone who was loyal to him when he needed it most during the campaign because he did something he didn\u2019t like (i.e., obey the law), what do you think he will do to someone who criticized him during that same time? Someone get Mitt Romney in a group chat to share with the class.\n\nSo, not only should staffers worry about being treated like Sessions or worse, but they can also look forward to likely being largely responsible for covering any legal bills related to the current investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Yeah, Sweet Potato Saddam Jr. is being covered by his dad\u2019s re-election campaign, but that cheap jackass is unlikely to pay that same courtesy to staffers who don\u2019t share the family name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, no one should pity those people whispering their fears to CNN.\n\nAlthough 45 has long spoken about the importance of loyalty among those who work for him, by that same token, he\u2019s also long proved himself to be the embodiment of the mantra \u201cTrust no one, bitch.\u201d So, for those working in the White House currently expressing befuddlement about that interview and wondering about the chances that they\u2019ll soon be treated like Sessions, one wonders on what planet they have been living. Like, who went into the White House thinking that that man, of all people, was going to be the Kendrick Lamar to their Rihanna?\n\nHave these people not read about how 45 has handled previous marriages? Have they not read the extensive reporting that\u2019s been done on the hundreds of people he never bothered to pay? Are they unfamiliar with scandals involving his beauty pageants, Trump University, his four bankruptcies, his former casino and so on?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have taken 45\u2019s remarks about Sessions to convince White House staffers that none of them are special snowflakes who can somehow get a narcissist who\u2019s spent much of his life screwing people over to be as loyal to them as they\u2019ve been to him. Ditto for the unemployed ex-Carrier workers talking about broken promises, and GOP senators feigning dismay at how 45 speaks of Justice Department officials.\n\nMeanwhile, 45 is laying the groundwork for future attacks against members of his own party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them have largely debased themselves by consistently defending the indefensible, though evidently, that is still not enough for their president.

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report. He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked. Sessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committe hearing with Rosenstein, Bass again wanted answers about documents coming from the FBI that appear to indirectly label the Black Lives Matter movement as a terrorist organization that threatens police. She also noted that members of the Black Lives Matter movement have been questioned by the FBI, yet no one seems to know anything about the document or how the conclusions in said document were made.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G.

According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said.

I didn\u2019t smoke weed in front of her. What I actually did was whip out a joint and tell her I was going to smoke it in her bathroom, where she regularly smokes her cigarettes to keep her apartment from smelling like tobacco. So I was actually trying to be respectful by hotboxing her bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she saw the joint, she made that face mothers make right before they say, \u201cWhat you not gon\u2019 do \u2026 \u201d But my mother didn\u2019t say anything. She just shook her head and walked away.\n\n\n\nNow, my mom kinda suspected that I was a weed smoker. But when California finally legalized recreational marijuana\u2014or adult use of marijuana, which some pro-cannabis activists prefer because, honestly, no one ever says \u201crecreational alcohol\u201d or \u201crecreational cigarettes\u201d about the two legal vices enjoyed and consumed by grown-ass people\u2014I thought it was time to clear the air, so to speak, and make it plain that I do enjoy legal weed, just as she enjoys her legal cigarettes.\n\nI mention this story because it appears that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be back on that bullshit about cracking down on marijuana. On Friday he met with a group of anti-legalization activists behind closed doors, and I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t swapping Christmas-cookie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, Sessions has never met with pro-pot activists during his first year in office. And last week, a video emerged showing Sessions in full asshole mode mocking a Department of Justice intern about her stance on marijuana while making a few misleading statements of his own (more on that later).\n\nSessions, who\u2019s been pretty wishy-washy about marijuana policy as attorney general, has famously said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d But that statement defies logic when you consider that 29 states have legalized medical marijuana and seven states plus Washington, D.C., have co-signed recreational weed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know any good people, which isn\u2019t hard to believe, to be honest.\n\nBut Sessions aside, there is still a pretty strong social stigma around people who use weed. The image of the stoner stuck on a couch eating Cheetos is probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of a weed smoker, which is why it\u2019s time for the good, weed-smoking people of America to let it be known that they happily puff-puff-pass while still managing to contribute to society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence has shown that weed is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, yet the federal government classifies it as a Schedule I drug, the highest classification, which puts marijuana on par with heroin. Our government thinks weed is more dangerous than Schedule II drugs cocaine and crystal meth, which is fucking bananas.\n\nSessions once even claimed that marijuana was \u201conly less awful than heroin,\u201d which is utter horseshit when you consider that the number of overdoses from opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers skyrocketed in 2016. (Sessions just recently conceded that weed isn\u2019t as bad as heroin. Gee, thanks, little buddy!)\n\nYou know how many people have died from a marijuana overdose in the history of marijuana? Zero.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study even suggested that opiate-related deaths went down after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, and some experts believe that cannabis could actually help ease the abuse of opioids, which account for 63 percent of all drug-related deaths.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of opioids, in that video with the intern, Sessions claimed that last year was the first time that drugs rather than alcohol caused more fatal car accidents. He\u2019s basically correct on that point (the year was actually 2015), except the issue is more nuanced than that.\n\nSince police still don\u2019t have a reliable DUI test for weed (officers are mainly just judging behavior to determine if a driver is high), it\u2019s difficult to know what role, if any, weed may have played in an accident, especially since marijuana stays in your system awhile after actual use. But what Sessions failed to mention is that there\u2019s also been a huge spike in prescription-opioid-related fatal car crashes (however, the same rule about no reliable DUI test also applies to opioids).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also asked that intern to check with the American Medical Association about the dangers of marijuana. Again, while Sessions is right that the AMA says marijuana is a dangerous drug and recreational weed should not be legalized, he didn\u2019t mention that the organization has also called for more research on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis. Because legalization is moving way faster than research, rescheduling the drug to open up scientific study makes even more sense from a public health point of view.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that black and brown people are still getting arrested at higher rates for marijuana possession, even in states with legal weed, so coming out wholeheartedly as a weed smoker still carries some real-life consequences (the prohibition of weed has always been primarily about race).\n\nBut really, the best way to destroy the stereotypical image of a pothead is to replace it with an image that looks more like you and me.

[Deputy Attorney General Rod J.] Rosenstein said that the department is adding safeguards to ensure that police have sufficient evidence of criminal activity when property is seized.

So to circumvent that, Mueller is using a secret weapon to prevent those pardons from happening.\n\nMueller has added Michael Dreeben to his team, according to Bloomberg. Dreeben is a career government lawyer who has the distinction of being one of only eight people in history to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court more than 100 times.\n\nSince Mueller brought him on, Dreeben has spent his time researching presidential pardons and figuring out what, if any, limits to them exist. He will also serve to make sure that everything Mueller does in a prosecutor capacity is legally airtight.\n\nIn reference to Dreeben, Kathryn Ruemmler of Latham & Watkins LLP\u2014 who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama\u2014told Bloomberg: \u201cHe\u2019s seen every criminal case of any consequence in the last 20 years.

He lost to a private practice lawyer by the name of John Roberts, the same John Roberts who is now chief justice of the United States.\n\nJust what Dreeben will be able to help Mueller achieve remains to be seen, but the simple fact that Mueller is stacking his deck in his own favor shows that this Russia probe is far from over and is likely on the way to yielding some low-hanging fruit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Bloomberg.", "keywords": ["lawyer", "filed", "special", "pardon", "friends", "spent", "help", "bloomberg", "weapon", "supreme", "court", "criminal", "trump", "secret", "try", "mueller", "dreeben", "prevent", "seen", "solicitor"], "polarity": 0.10190476190476191, "subjectivity": 0.4786375661375661},

No one, not one person on the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked the question Attorney General Jeff Sessions needed to answer: How long has he been working for Donald Trump while secretly making cookies in a tree?!\n\n\n\nHow do you have the head Keebler elf, arguably the highest-ranking elf in Keebler history, in front of you and don\u2019t ask how the hell they make cookies in a damn tree?! Do the other elves make living wages? Do they have health care? Do they have a pension?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do you let him off the hook?!\n\nLook, if you close your eyes, Sessions sounds like 1950s Southern racism. He literally is the vocal embodiment of Jim Crow, and the fact that he looks like a Keebler elf, and sounds like hatred of \u201ccoloreds,\u201d is troubling. Also, I hate when old people wear little glasses. It\u2019s kind of like British judges who wear powdered wigs; it\u2019s just weird.\n\nAlso, I think every person who sits in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee is really there just to read his or her opening statement. Sessions came out swinging, calling any rumors or reports that he \u201cparticipated in anything to hurt this country\u201d an \u201cappalling and detestable lie.\u201d Aside from that, I\u2019d say Sessions did about as expected. He was fake charming the way old Southern racism is fake charming, and just an old man with early-onset dementia when need be. The true stars to come out of this hearing were Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and the real loser was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCotton was a waste. He started his questioning chastising the members of the committee and then opened his questioning asking Sessions if he read fiction and liked James Bond and Jason Bourne movies. We saw what you were doing there, Cotton, and you needed to stop it with the political smug. Cotton should have yielded his time to an adult. Like Kamala Harris and Angus King, the real MVPs.\n\nKing and Harris were not here for Sessions\u2019 bullshit; not his general bullshit or his fake-befuddled, Southern-fried bullshit. First off, King wanted to understand why Sessions wasn\u2019t answering questions that weren\u2019t classified. He also pressed Sessions on whether the president had invoked executive privilege, to which Sessions replied that the president had not, adding that Trump was the only one who could invoke such privilege.\n\n\n\nSo King wanted to know why Sessions was refusing to answer questions about unclassified conversations. Sessions offered no clear reason why he wouldn\u2019t answer all questions, just gave some Southern buttered bullshit about the president being allowed to decide if he wants to invoke executive privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the testy exchange below:\n\nAnd I have to point this out because it was glaring and unsettling: Why were the chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee constantly trying to wrangle and silence Harris? Tuesday marked the second time that Harris was reprimanded during Senate Intelligence Committee hearings. She was silenced during former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s hearings, and then again during Tuesday\u2019s hearing with Sessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Harris was not here for Sessions\u2019 anti-marijuana-laced bullshit. She jumped on Sessions early and fast, pressing him about documentation that he may have kept, since he didn\u2019t seem to recall anything. She began drilling Sessions with questions about whether he\u2019d ever had meetings with Russian nationals, to which Sessions continually claimed, \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d\n\nAnd then, as Harris tried to shut up his slow, Southern-steeped bullshit, Sessions shouted: \u201cWill you let me qualify it? If I don\u2019t qualify, you\u2019ll accuse me of lying! I\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast; it makes me nervous.\u201d\n\nShortly after the exchange, Harris was told to allow the witness to answer. Watch Harris press Sessions, only to be chided by the Senate Intelligence Committee chairs for the second time:\n\nI will say this: Sessions was nothing if not forceful in responding to the questions he did choose to answer, and direct in laying it on thick. It was clear from the onset that he didn\u2019t plan to answer anything directly. In fact, saying \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d with a lot of Southern bass in your voice can make you sound believable, even when you are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Sessions, much like the rest of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, is a waste of space and time. In truth, you would think that Sessions would be pro-weed, considering that his real livelihood depends on cookie sales, but until I see his tax records and he can confirm that the other elves are making livable wages, he can go back into the tree from which he came.", "keywords": ["sessions", "questions", "intelligence", "king", "answer", "harris", "let", "hook", "bullshit", "jeff", "senate", "southern", "committee"], "polarity": 0.012600806451612908, "subjectivity": 0.41989247311827965},

Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["trust", "targeting", "intelligence", "history", "communities", "russian", "russia", "folks", "told", "proof", "given", "black", "fbis", "fbi", "investigation", "grant"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

To serve one\u2019s God is a mighty purpose. It requires selflessness and compassion.\n\n\n\nSo it is with all due respect that I ask, what the fuck happened to Mark Burns? I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling. To date, Burns has some 87,300 followers on Twitter and an additional 4,500 on Instagram. Not to mention, he pastors a church, which means he\u2019s preaching his love of Trump and all things Trumpian to rooms full of black people. And. They. Are. Listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to two points: 1) We cannot dismiss Burns, and 2) What the fuck happened to him? Like, what level of self-hatred must you endure to fall this far? He\u2019s 38 years old, which means that someone in his life had to love him enough to induce him to the revolutionary sounds of N.W.A. Where was he during the No Limit movement? Has he ever been \u201cBout It, Bout It\u201d?\n\nDid he not watch the Diff\u2019rent Strokes episode where Dudley was almost molested by the bicycle-store owner, but for a quick-thinking Arnold? That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K. Brown, to tweet this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat happened. And this man is ministering to other black people. He\u2019s widening his platform daily and is one of the few public black faces that are helping to grease the asses of other black folks so that Trump\u2019s foot can fit. I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

Or did they? They can\u2019t recall exactly. If they did, it wasn\u2019t improper, and it was definitely in self-defense.\n\n\n\nMichael Slager, a former North Charleston, S.C., cop, is currently standing trial for the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist. While criminal charges against Slager ended in a mistrial last year, Slager has pleaded guilty to federal charges of deprivation of rights under the color of law. In doing so, Slager owned up to using excessive force in Scott\u2019s death, admitting that he hadn\u2019t shot Scott in self-defense as he originally claimed (cellphone video caught Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Slager\u2019s attorneys say, the ex-cop wasn\u2019t lying. He was just stressed out. And they\u2019re using Jeff Sessions\u2019 \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d (read: trash) memory as evidence.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, federal prosecutors are seeking an enhanced sentence against Slager for obstruction of justice\u2014a punishment that they feel he deserves for lying his ass off for two years. But defense lawyers claimed in a federal court filing last week that Slager\u2019s inconsistent accounts of Scott\u2019s death were the result of intense pressure.\n\n\u201cA Swiss cheese memory is a symptom of stress, not an indicator of lying,\u201d they wrote, including testimony from a medical expert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause this is 2017, Slager\u2019s attorneys then cited Sessions\u2019 conflicting and ever changing accounts of his contact with Russian agents as an example.\n\nHere is their argument, from the Post:\n\n\u201cUnlike Slager, who had been in what he perceived a life and death struggle before he made his statements, Sessions had time to prepare for his Congressional testimony, yet still often got it wrong,\u201d they wrote in their filing. \u201cWhy? According to Sessions, he was working in chaotic conditions created by the Trump campaign,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis was undoubtedly stressful, though not as stressful as having shot a man to death, or dealing with the aftermath of that, or facing the death penalty or life in prison. As Sessions made clear in his statement, a failure to recall, or an inaccurate recollection, does not a liar make.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Slager\u2019s attorneys really believe that Sessions was being honest in his congressional testimony? It\u2019s possible. But citing Sessions is a calculated move meant to put the Department of Justice\u2014whose prosecutors brought the federal charges against Slager\u2014in an awkward position. Essentially, DOJ prosecutors can\u2019t insist that Slager is a liar without implying, however indirectly, that their boss is probably one, too.\n\nIt\u2019s transparent as hell\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work.\n\nHere\u2019s another section from the defense filing:\n\n\u201cLike Sessions, Slager never lied or misled anyone,\u201d the defense attorneys\u2019 filing reads. \u201cLike Sessions, he answered the questions that were asked. When he had his memory refreshed, he added the refreshed recollection to his testimony. When he failed to remember certain items, it can be attributed to the stress or chaos of the event during which the memory should have been formed.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorally bankrupt courtroom arguments aren\u2019t unique to 2017. Neither, unfortunately, is police brutality. Still, this particular example\u2014a lying cop seeking a lighter sentence after killing an unarmed 50-year-old black man, a crime he now admits to, and citing a lying attorney general once deemed to be too racist to even be a federal judge\u2014feels like a fresh twist on an old, prolonged horror.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["cop", "sessions", "testimony", "slagers", "walter", "federal", "help", "scott", "attorneys", "memory", "jeff", "killed", "slager", "death", "sentence", "lying", "lighter"], "polarity": -0.022329931972789117, "subjectivity": 0.4935884353741497},

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right.

I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot.

Karen Bass (D-Calif.) completely dismantled U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Bass questioned why the FBI would be investigating and writing reports on \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d labeling them as a threat against the police, but not writing those same reports and conducting those same investigations on the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\n\nBass started out by asking the chairperson of the committee to allow her to enter into the record the recent FBI report \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.\u201d Sessions told Bass that he had not read the report, but he knew about some of the alleged targeting of officers by \u201ccertain groups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he could get into his line of bullshit on it, Bass asked him who in his department had the power to order the report to be put together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that report got ordered,\u201d Sessions said weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I explicitly approved it or directed it.\u201d\n\n[So you\u2019re in charge, but you have no idea how something like this could come about? OK, sir.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d]\n\n\u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d\n\nBass cut him off.\n\n\u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question. It\u2019s easy to label black people who fight for racial justice and racism as the actual racists when we know that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t follow that question,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPlease again?\u201d\n\nBass then asked her question even more directly than she did the first time: \u201cIs there a term or a report on white identity extremists? You mentioned you are familiar with black people who identify with their racial identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not coming to me at this moment.\u201d\n\n[OK, sir. You can\u2019t remember the name of ONE white extremist group? Really, former senator of Alabama? Not ONE? OK.]\n\nBass was incredulous: \u201cNot coming to you?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t about to let Sessions off the hook that easily.\n\n\u201cCertainly a group such as the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d she said, in an attempt to jog his memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seemed to work. Suddenly Sessions remembered. \u201cYes, and then the skinhead movements, but there is racial identity white movements that have been identified for sure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo has the FBI done a report on white identity extremists that are likely motivated to target law-enforcement officers?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[So, no. Just say that, sir. You haven\u2019t. You haven\u2019t because you are OK with white extremist groups.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCould you name an African-American organization that has committed violent acts against police officers? Could you name one today? In this report, they name organizations from 30 or 40 years ago, but can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?\u201d Bass asked.\n\nGotcha! Sessions waffled and could not name any such organization, because as we all know, that is some extreme bullshit.\n\n\u201cI believe I could, but I would want to be, um, to confirm that and submit it to you in writing, but I believe we had in the last year or so four police officers killed by a group that some have described as extremist,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was referring to the shooting in Dallas or perhaps in Baton Rouge, La., that they tried to tie to Black Lives Matter, but we all know that was some bullshit, too.\n\nBass cut to the chase and asked the most necessary question, because we know exactly whom the FBI were talking about and whom they were targeting when they put out that fake-ass report.\n\n\u201cWould you consider Black Lives Matter a black identity extremist group?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to comment on that. I have not so declared it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAgain, Bass put out there what all of us have been thinking since that ridiculous report made the news, saying:\n\nSo, you should know that a lot of activists around the country are very concerned that we\u2019re getting ready to repeat a very sad chapter of our history, where people who are rightfully protesting what they consider to be an injustice in their community\u2014which is their relationship with police officers\u2014are now being targeted and labeled as extremists and are going through periods of surveillance and harassment, and so I would like to know, what is your department going to do to protect the rights of average citizens to protest if they have a concern about police officers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was quick to go on the offensive.\n\n\u201cThis department will not unlawfully target people,\u201d he said.\n\nBass then said:\n\nSo, if that\u2019s the case then, I would ask that you review this report\u2014\u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d\u2014because I personally don\u2019t believe that any such organizations exist. The organizations that are referred to in this report are organizations from decades ago, so I would like to know what will you do to essentially roll back what is listed in this report? Because it\u2019s not accurate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a pregnant pause while Sessions considered what lie he should let fly out of his mouth next.\n\nHe then said, \u201cWe will look at the report. I\u2019d actually be interested in reading it. But they usually do an excellent job\u2014objective and fair\u2014on those kind of reports.\u201d\n\n[Objective and fair? OK, Bilbo Bigot.]\n\nBass did a great job ripping into Sessions and getting him to basically admit that the \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d report was full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Lives Matter and other social groups that are fighting for racial equality and calling out the deaths of black men at the hands of police are not a threat to law enforcement. That is the narrative Sessions has been driving, however, since he took the job as attorney general. Enough is enough.\n\nSalute to Karen Bass.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law professor quoted in the Raw Story article, said, state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Story also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet-fuel-tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans had threatened to pull their support.\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, also responded to Cagle, criticizing the lieutenant governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon.com\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time magazine, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["raw", "delta", "nra", "tax", "biggest", "governor", "hes", "young", "threatening", "states", "wannabe", "loves", "state", "lawmakers", "second", "georgia", "employers", "cagle", "discounts"], "polarity": -0.020344635523206957, "subjectivity": 0.356445043052186},

Ahhh, yes! The White House press briefing. And what a show of fecal spray it was today.\n\n\n\nOn a day when Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, surrendered to authorities after a federal grand jury indicted the pair on 12 counts, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders put on one of her most dazzling displays of truth bending to date.\n\nSanders executed her usual routine of evading questions by saying that she hadn\u2019t \u201cspoken to the president about it\u201d (then bish, why are you here?) and dragging Hillary Clinton\u2019s name into business that has nothing to do with her. But because this administration\u2019s motto is \u201c(Lie) faster, (cheat) higher, (bullshit) stronger,\u201d Sanders also added in a three-minute-long word problem and her best Mariah Carey impersonation.\n\nSanders wore Pepto Bismol pink to lie-apalooza the press conference, maybe because all the lies she was about to spew forth on the taxpayer dime were giving her a bad case of the bubble guts.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\nLOL, Sarah, Quit Playing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders, who shares genes with a man who easily cracks the top three least-funny men on the planet, opted to begin the briefing with a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic I know all of you are preparing to ask me about,\u201d Sanders said to a room full of stressed-out political reporters who did not have time for this. \u201cTax reform.\u201d\n\nOhohohohoh Sarah!

To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part. Watch as she proverbially clutches her faux pearls in faux-righteous anger and asks, But why aren\u2019t we talking about Hillary, though?\n\n\u201cThe real collusion scandal, as we\u2019ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,\u201d Sanders said, evoking notable criminal investigator O.J. Simpson (emphasis mine).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence [the election],\u201d Sanders continued.\n\n\n\nHuh. Let me shuffle through my papers a bit here\u2014and by papers I mean these stacks of credit card offers that I hold on to as if they were my damn dowry.\n\nOh yes, funny how nann one member of the Clinton campaign has been charged by a federal prosecutor with conspiracy against the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Don\u2019t Know Her\n\nGet ready\u2014the White House is basically turning into one big Mariah Carey IDontKnowHer.gif.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked directly about Papadopoulos\u2019 specific relationship to Trump and his campaign, Sanders tried to distance him from the administration.\n\n\u201cIt was a volunteer position,\u201d Sanders said, making the former policy adviser sound like a teen doing a Habitat for Humanity project on spring break.\n\n\u201cNo activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort has pleaded guilty to making a false statement but has entered pleas of not guilty for the higher charges, including, once again, conspiracy against the whole-ass country. But as the Washington Post notes, even though Papadopoulos is a smaller fish than Manafort, his plea deal is the game changer here because it means he\u2019s actively cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nAs much as Sanders wants to play down the former Trump campaign policy adviser as though he were some transfer student who showed up for one group project meeting and dipped, that plea deal indicates otherwise.

Susan Collins (R-Maine), who told committee members during opening remarks, \u201cI have never witnessed anything to suggest that Senator Sessions is anything other than a dedicated public servant and a decent man.\u201d According to Collins, Sessions \u201cis not motivated by racial animus.\u201d\n\nThen came Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who asked Sessions, \u201cWould you agree that being called a racist is the worst thing that can ever happen to someone?\u201d Sessions emphatically replied, \u201cWhy, yes, sir, I would.\u201d\n\nThese two said this even though Coretta Scott King once wrote, 30 years prior, that Sessions would \u201cirreparably damage the work of my husband\u201d when he was nominated for a federal judgeship. Everything about Sessions screams Dennis the Menace if Dennis the Menace grew up to be a racist with power. Still, these politicians argued that he was just a nice ole Southern fella, and it\u2019s so doggone sad that folks want to brand that Confederacy-loving, egg-headed fuck exactly what the hell he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining them in the lie were two high-profile black Republicans\u2014former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.)\u2014both of whom pathetically lent their endorsement to Sessions for attorney general. Rice has long been an apologist for terrible white men associated with the Republican Party. Just last week, she was excusing Minute Maid Mao\u2019s madness. As for Scott, who spent 30 minutes on the Senate floor advocating for Sessions, well, if self-loathsomeness is contagious, may he forever keep the fuck away from \u2019round me.\n\nSessions has been off to a rousing start since being confirmed as attorney general. He may very well have perjured himself in those very confirmation hearings during an exchange with Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). And while he was supposed to have recused himself from Mother Russia and the investigation into possible collusion between its government and Saddle Tan Nixon\u2019s presidential campaign, uh, ask fired FBI Director James Comey about how that\u2019s gone.\n\nYet, between being a known racist, a liar and, potentially, someone who helped a sitting president obstruct justice, Sessions remains attorney general. It\u2019s as if nothing matters anymore. That is, almost nothing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLate last week, Sessions issued a new directive (pdf) for federal prosecutors nationwide: \u201cthat prosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense.\u201d\n\nIt came along with several other departures from directives issued during the Obama era at the Justice Department. In a news conference, Sessions said: \u201cCharging and sentencing recommendations are bedrock responsibilities of any prosecutor, and I trust our prosecutors in the field to make good judgments. They deserve to be unhandcuffed and not micromanaged from Washington.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also argued, \u201cThe most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d Sessions even called the move \u201csimply the right and moral thing to do.\u201d Who better to judge us on right and wrong than the suited redneck who perjures himself and helps another con man try to get out of a federal investigation?\n\nIn response, former Attorney General Eric Holder released a statement, claiming: \u201cThe policy announced today is not tough on crime. It is dumb on crime. It is an ideologically motivated, cookie-cutter approach that has only been proven to generate unfairly long sentences that are often applied indiscriminately and do little to achieve long-term public safety.\u201d\n\nThere are conservatives who agree with Holder\u2014including the likes of Marc Levin, the policy director at Right on Crime, whom Vice described as \u201ca leading voice for criminal justice reform in the conservative movement.\u201d The same goes for Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who declared via memo, \u201cMandatory minimum sentences have unfairly and disproportionately incarcerated too many minorities for too long. Attorney General Sessions\u2019 new policy will accentuate that injustice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt will, but it is by design. It is the same reason private-prison stocks rose dramatically after the results of the 2016 presidential election and continued to rise well into 2017 after the current administration noted that it would continue to use private prisons.\n\n\n\nHolder blasted Sessions\u2019 \u201cunwise and ill-informed\u201d move, arguing that the decision would \u201ctake this nation back.\u201d Therein lies the intent: to \u201cMake America great again.\u201d This was undoubtedly a part of their mission, and sadly, it\u2019s the one area where they have the best chance of success.\n\n\n\nSessions, like so many associated with this administration, is majorly ill prepped to run a government. Their xenophobia has failed them in their attempt to enact a Muslim travel ban that the courts would allow. Their nativism won\u2019t bring them their \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d which is a stupid idea, but it will yield them marginal success in the rising terror that is their widespread deportation agenda (aided largely by former President Obama\u2019s own troubling pattern). That isn\u2019t enough, though. They want a real win, and given that the reality of their obvious racism won\u2019t get in the way of their plan to stack prisons with even more black bodies, here we are.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is one thing Sessions has mastered, it\u2019s how to legislate oppression that will undoubtedly have an impact on black people, about whom a man named Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III was clearly raised to harbor certain attitudes. All too often in America, you can win when you bet against black, no matter how great a fool you may be. The war on drugs has long been proved to be unwinnable because these folks have been fighting with the wrong tools, but that war has always been an excuse to imprison black people.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what Ava DuVernay explored in the phenomenal yet terrifying documentary 13th. It\u2019s as ironic as it is despicable that Sessions\u2019 move will lead an already enormous prison population to rise even more as he himself actively toys with the law, but that is the pervasiveness of whiteness for you. It ought to matter more that Sessions may belong in a cell more than the folks whose lives he just further ruined, but this is where we are.\n\nHistory will not be kind to Jeff Sessions, but hindsight will not make anyone who cares now more comfortable about the present and not-too-distant future that awaits us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuck Jeff Sessions. Fuck everyone in the U.S. Senate who spoke highly of him. Fuck every senator who feigned greater offense about being called a racist than about the burdens that racism places on all of our darker backs. Fuck the black people who actually lent their hues to his long-stemming hatred of us. Fuck everyone who voted to confirm him.

Trump seemingly flipped the script on his band of merry deplorables, claiming that he favored a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d approach to addressing violence.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait and play games, and nothing gets done,\u201d Trump said, sounding almost like a Democrat, but his voice wasn\u2019t whiny enough, Al-Jazeera reports. \u201cWe want to stop the problems.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe news site notes that Democrats in attendance urged the president to use his political power to influence his party to take action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is going to have to be you,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told Trump.\n\nThe president called for stronger background checks, which for some ungodly reason the GOP and the NRA are against. Is this because it would make it harder for a certain section of America (read: bootleg dentistry and fat-tire-pickup drivers) to purchase guns at gun shows?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a gun show?\u201d you ask? Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said. Trump then added that police should be able to take civilians\u2019 firearms without a court order, to which all of the GOP Congress members in the room began looking at their phones. Apparently the NRA sent out a mass text stating, \u201cFuck that shit! Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. Toomey told the president it did not. To which the president replied: \u201cYou know why , bitch ? Because you\u2019re afraid of the NRA.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats might be spineless, but they aren\u2019t stupid. Many noted that the president is batshit crazy, and therefore took little interest in his newfound ways.

Soon after Comey\u2019s ouster, Rosenstein\u2014who had been Comey\u2019s direct superior at the Justice Department\u2014appointed Mueller, a former FBI director himself and a friend of Comey\u2019s, to lead a wide-ranging probe, ostensibly focused on Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election but also encompassing a host of allegations made against Trump and his associates.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil the president\u2019s tweet, it was unconfirmed as to whether or not the president was officially part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The tweet seems to confirm that he is, in fact, being investigated, but CNN notes that it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s text is referring to reports that he\u2019s under investigation or whether the White House received official notice that he\u2019s being investigated.\n\nWhich leads to why everyone remotely associated with Trump wants his dumb ass to stay off Twitter. It\u2019s one thing to be an incompetent leader who can hide behind an intelligent staff (see: the second Bush). But Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking directly to his followers as if he\u2019s the lead singer of a boy band is leading to more trouble.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, has to answer for his dumbass tweets, and CNN notes that she\u2019s referring inquiries into his tweets to his private attorney, Marc Kasowitz. This proves how reckless his tweeting has become: His press staff can\u2019t even answer for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for those of us who wish him out of office, this might be his best use of 140 characters.

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["trust", "targeting", "intelligence", "history", "communities", "russian", "russia", "folks", "told", "proof", "given", "black", "fbis", "fbi", "investigation", "grant"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim. Allegations of FISA abuses surfaced again last month, when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a controversial memo alleging that FBI and Justice Department officials misused their authority to obtain a surveillance order on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo King Keebler Klaus\u2014or KKK, for short\u2014finally said, \u201cFine. \u2018I\u2019ll fake-look into it.\u201d Basically, he was throwing the president a bone, and even that pissed off the president because nothing is good enough for this man.

We are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel; we don\u2019t have time to talk to you.\u201d\n\nWhen Cross told the flight attendant that she was, in fact, a licensed doctor, the flight attendant demanded to see her credentials. In the end, a white man also came forward and said he was a physician, and the flight attendant opted to take his help instead, telling Cross, \u201cThanks for your help, but he can help us, and he has his credentials.\u201d\n\nCross said that she did not see the doctor show any credentials at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Delta is saying that showing credentials will no longer be necessary.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the airline had put out a statement saying that it was policy to request medical credentials before allowing in-flight treatment, and that Cross did not show her credentials, but another passenger did.\n\nCross countered that argument, pointing out that doctors don't necessarily carry their hospital badges or have their licenses on hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen situations like the one described by Dr. Cross arise, we have a responsibility to our employees and our customers to review the circumstances and our policies for opportunities to listen, learn and improve,\" Allison Ausband, senior vice president for In-Flight Service, said in a statement from the airline.\n\nAusband said that she was able to speak to Cross over the phone and invited the doctor to visit Delta to \"discuss her experience face to face and apologize for how that experience made her feel.\"\n\nWhen Cross went to Delta headquarters to meet with executives, she asked Wayne Riley, a mentor and the past president of the American College of Physicians, to accompany her. Riley told Delta that he had assisted passengers several times on Delta flights over the years and had never been asked to prove he was a doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As part of the review, Delta found that there is no legal or regulatory requirement upon the airline to view medical professional credentials,\" the statement continued. \"And, as it becomes more and more common for medical licenses to be verified online, physicians and nurses often do not carry a license with them and some states no longer issue wallet versions.\"\n\nThe airline said it also launched inclusion training three months ago for Delta leaders, and it announced that over the next year it will expand its diversity and inclusion training to front-line employees, including flight attendants.\n\n\u201cOur flight attendants were following standard procedure during this incident and the feedback Dr. Cross provided gave us a chance to make flying better,\u201d said Ausband. \u201cWe remain grateful to the medical professionals who are willing to assist us in an emergency at 30,000 feet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCross, for her part, said that she is satisfied with the changes that have been made in light of her bad experience.\n\n\"Although this was an unfortunate encounter, I am pleased with the changes that have been made to Delta's policies and training as a result,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is reassuring to know that Delta has taken this matter very seriously and made the necessary adjustments to help physicians and other medical personnel, no matter who they may be, feel more comfortable offering medical assistance during in-flight emergencies.\"\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["doctor", "changes", "medical", "attendant", "help", "cross", "policy", "credentials", "air", "lines", "stopped", "helping", "black", "physicians", "training", "flight", "delta"], "polarity": 0.06134651600753295, "subjectivity": 0.29924670433145006},

Or just a conservative. Or capital letter White. Or even very problematic.\n\nNo, she is an abjectly awful person. She says abhorrent and hateful things, and has leveraged this abhorrence and hate to give herself a larger platform to infect more people with it and make more money off of it. She is willfully and dangerously ignorant, is either unaware of or unconcerned with historical context, and also seems to have no problem inciting violence against people protesting and brutalized by it. If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne. Look how fun she looks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when we allow that to happen, we're not brave. We're not sober. We're not attempting to find a common ground. We're not extending an olive branch.

Not President Donald Trump, though; he\u2019s out stunting, bashing the armed school security officer for not running into the school to save the kids, and of course, making everything about himself.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know until you test it, but I think, I really believe I\u2019d run in there, even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,\u201d Trump told a gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a test; you don\u2019t even have to pull out a pen and paper\u2014Trump would fail, miserably. This is a president who is afraid of germs, afraid of bald eagles, afraid of being booed and afraid of being poisoned, and he used bone spurs as an excuse to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere is nothing that Donald Trump has ever done that would give anybody the impression he would risk his own life to run into a hail of bullets to protect a bunch of kids, maybe not even his own.\n\n\n\nNever fear, though; there are some decent presidents out there, and I can think of about 10 off the top of my head who would be more likely to\u2014and whom I\u2019d rather have\u2014risk life and limb to save a bunch of kids from a mass shooting than Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger. Best-case scenario would be he rescues the kids and the cops use a Taser on him because he \u201cfit the description\u201d of a white 19-year-old school shooter.\n\n9. George H.W. Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson. Didn\u2019t you see him take out Homer Simpson? He\u2019d save the kids and the shooter would be found dead with a bunch of state secrets planted in his backpack.\n\n8. Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part. He\u2019s also an idiot and would probably blow up the school, killing everyone. So maybe not the best choice, but still better than Trump.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Andrew Jackson\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nAndrew Jackson, our seventh president, 20 Dollar Jack, survived 13 duels, lived with a bullet in his leg for 19 years and was known to beat folks down with a hickory stick just for fun. He was an unrepentant racist and attempted genocide against the Cherokee with the Trail of Tears. He\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite president. So he\u2019d definitely run into a school to save a bunch of kids for the glory, but only the white ones because racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The President From Rick and Morty\n\nThe president in Rick and Morty is a badass, he has an arsenal of weapons, he\u2019s vengeful and he fought the smartest man in the universe over a selfie. If he weren\u2019t black, I\u2019m pretty sure Trump would nominate him to run into a hail of bullets and save a bunch of kids in his place. And he\u2019s voiced by Keith David. Who isn\u2019t comforted by the sound of Keith David\u2019s voice in times of danger?\n\n5. Frank Underwood\n\nScreenshot: House of Cards (Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse of Card\u2019s President Frank Underwood would calmly walk into the school, talk down the shooter and convince him to hand over his weapons. In a small room off from the side of the gym, the sick shooter would cry in Underwood\u2019s arms, finally feeling someone understood him, until Underwood strangled him with a jump rope and then ran out to tell the SWAT team there was nothing he could do. Maybe I should\u2019ve made Frank first. Oh, wait, he can\u2019t be allowed around teenage boys.\n\n4. Bill Clinton\n\nYes, Bill Clinton is a draft dodger just like Trump, and nothing about him strikes me as being particularly altruistic. But if there is a top 10 list of any presidents, you have to find a space for Slick Willy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. James Marshall\n\nThis was close; it was between Marshall and David Palmer from 24, but Marshall wins out because Air Force One is one of the best movies of all time and spawned the eternal debate: Which president would you rather have save your life? It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder. He would bust into the school, save the kids, take out the shooter and have an incredible DMX soundtrack blaring in the background. Mind you, if he screwed up or got lost on the way to save the kids, the buffalo soldiers would show up and actually get the job done\u2014showing once again how black Americans are always there to clean up America\u2019s problems.\n\n", "keywords": ["presidents", "save", "shooter", "school", "hes", "trump", "run", "president", "bunch", "afraid", "likely", "kids"], "polarity": 0.0983643353174603, "subjectivity": 0.4928311011904762},

That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["different", "world", "production", "designer", "marvel", "told", "hannah", "walks", "important", "beachler", "black", "panther", "know", "africa", "wakanda", "studiosdisney"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["im", "watch", "sure", "political", "republican", "convention", "used", "cpac", "pretty", "conservative", "trump", "introduce", "white", "trumps", "black", "video", "conservatives", "list", "nigger"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV.

Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang!

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester. OK, I didn\u2019t go there, I mean, hell, I was smart enough to know not to go there, but I don\u2019t know how he makes this shit up! Also, did you know he has another daughter named Tiffany, but no one ever talks about her?! You, want to know why? Because I\u2019m the dominant Trump offspring! I\u2019m better than Fredo and Vampire Boy and Tiffany\u2014who?

The New York Times reports that Walker also helped to supervise South Africa\u2019s first fully representative elections in 1994, after the apartheid regime fell there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker helped circulate one of King\u2019s most deeply felt and inspiring works, \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important blueprints of the civil rights movement, and helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, which culminated with King\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nKing was said to have described Walker as \u201cone of the keenest minds of the nonviolent revolution.\u201d\n\nIt seemed as if Walker was destined to fight the good fight no matter who it was against. At one point, the Times reports, infamous drug kingpin Frank Lucas put a hit on him, but Walker said that because he had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, he \u201cwas accustomed to dangerous situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWyatt Tee Walker was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children, and a grandson of slaves. He received an education at the HBCU Virginia Union University, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree with honors, in both physics and chemistry, at age 19. He pledged the Gamma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and met King (also an Alpha) while in college. He also obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union\u2019s Graduate School of Religion. In 1950 he married Theresa Edwards, with whom he eventually had four children: Wyatt Jr., Robert, Earl and Ann.\n\nWalker began his civil rights work in Virginia and served as president for five years of the Petersburg branch of the NAACP and as state director of the Congress of Racial Equality, which he co-founded in 1958.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe joined the SCLC in 1961\u2014personally recruited by King\u2014and eventually moved to Atlanta to serve as its first full-time executive director. In 1965 Walker moved to Harlem, where he initially was a minister at the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church. Two years later, he became the pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until 2004.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Walker served as urban affairs specialist to New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, helping advise on racial relations and integration. In 1975 he completed his doctorate at Colgate Rochester Divinity School.\n\n\n\nOf his myriad civil rights works, the Times reports that as pastor of Canaan, Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly, and what the church calls the oldest senior-services center in Harlem. He also established Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank.

Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["notes", "care", "teacher", "listening", "massshooting", "check", "going", "trump", "white", "violent", "president", "victims", "teachers", "house", "remember", "school"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

You can read it below:\n\nThankfully, because God is still guiding the way, no matter how much hatred the Trump administration spouts, Carruth now knows that staying out of his son\u2019s life is the best move. Last month, Carruth wrote a 16-page self-serving apology that he sent to a television station, claiming that his son\u2019s grandmother had been spreading false stories about him. It was a stark contrast from the four-page, 800-word letter he recently sent to the Charlotte Observer noting that he recognizes that not being around would be in \u201ceveryone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor all involved or invested in this ordeal, please calm down,\u201d Carruth wrote to Observer reporter Scott Fowler. \u201cI will no longer be pursuing a relationship with Chancellor and Ms. Adams. I promise to leave them be, which I now see is in everyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nTiffany Shears-Trice, a spokesperson for the Carruth family, who holds the ex-NFL player\u2019s power of attorney, told the newspaper that the former wide receiver is \u201cjust trying to do the right thing here with the Adams family and not disrupt anyone\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cRae can see Chancellor is a happy, healthy soul and he doesn\u2019t want to interfere with that,\u201d Shears-Trice said. \u201cBut he will still live up to his financial responsibilities for his son\u2014he definitely wants to do that and he will do that. He wants to help.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Post notes that \u201cSaundra Adams was awarded nearly $5.8 million in damages in a wrongful death lawsuit in 2003, but she said she\u2019s received hardly any money from that judgment since the four men convicted in the plot have been imprisoned or unemployed since that time.\u201d\n\nDuring his stay in prison, Carruth become a barber and was earning roughly a dollar per day. A long way from his NFL days, when, the Post reports, Carruth was cashing game checks totaling nearly $40,000.\n\n\n\nCarruth apologized for \u201chaving the audacity to believe that there was ever a real place\u201d for him in Chancellor\u2019s life aside from afar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe may have called me \u2018Rae,\u2019 but I was really looking forward to giving him a dad,\u201d Carruth wrote.\n\nMan, fuck this guy.

Carson was warned prior to the tour that including his son could create a conflict of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, you know, who cares about those minor details.\n\nHUD spokesman Raffi Williams told the Times that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t know the table had been purchased,\u201d but also that he does not believe it cost too much and he has no intentions of returning it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big \u201cSo fucking what\u201d for your ass, right?\n\n\u201cIn general, the secretary does want to be as fiscally prudent as possible with the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Williams added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nAlthough federal law requires that approval be sought from Congress if the cost of furnishing or redecorating the office of a department head costs more than $5,000, HUD did not request approval for the $31,561 purchase.\n\nWilliams told the Times that the department didn\u2019t seek approval because the dining set, which is located in Carson\u2019s 10th-floor office suite, served a \u201cbuildingwide\u201d need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is everyone eating lunch at that table or \u2026 ?\n\nAccording to the Times, Helen G. Foster\u2014a former top HUD official\u2014filed a complaint claiming that she was demoted and transferred after she pushed back on Candy Carson\u2019s request to work around the $5,000 redecoration law.\n\nCandy Carson\u2019s pressure reportedly began even before her husband was in his position as HUD secretary. Foster was instructed by HUD\u2019s interim secretary, Craig Clemmensen, to find money for Candy Carson to redecorate the office. He is reported to have said that \u201c$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Foster refused to comply, she was removed from her position as the department\u2019s chief administrative officer and made head of the agency\u2019s unit overseeing Freedom of Information Act requests. Foster viewed that as retribution for her noncompliance.\n\nWilliams says that Foster\u2019s reassignment was a routine agency reshuffle and denies that Candy Carson pressured Foster to help redecorate the office.\n\nSure, Jan.\n\n\u201cSecretary Carson, to the best of our knowledge, is the only secretary to go to the subbasement at his agency to select the furniture for his office,\u201d Williams said.", "keywords": ["budget", "funding", "department", "wants", "carson", "office", "officeredecoration", "money", "carsons", "candy", "cut", "times", "ben", "secretary", "foster", "hud", "williams"], "polarity": 0.05328683662016996, "subjectivity": 0.4115734060178505},

She is a real, down-home patriot. So much so that she unwittingly promoted Russian-coordinated events on Facebook in support of Donald Trump. Goldfarb, who runs the Team Trump Broward County Facebook page, was one of the 53 percent of white women who backed Trump in 2016 and likely didn\u2019t need Russia\u2019s help to do it. But CNN reports that she did, in fact, promote pro-Trump events that were encouraged by Russian trolls on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they were involved or not,\u201d she told a CNN reporter when confronted about her involvement in Russia-backed events organized by the Being Patriotic Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the least important thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo a foreign adversary meddles in the U.S. elections and uses you in the process, yet you are patriotic? OK, Becky. OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her that the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing that they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring that the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller didn\u2019t find that suspicious.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate, and there was nothing, nothing at all, that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\n\u201cBandit\u201d is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone.

Carruth was a wide receiver with the Carolina Panthers and was casually dating Cherica Adams, who was seven months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child, which he wanted her to abort. Adams refused. So Carruth smooth-talked her into going to see The Bone Collector. Adams didn\u2019t feel right. She called her mother, who told her not to go. She went anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the movie, Carruth wanted to go back to Adams\u2019 place. So off they went, Carruth in his white Ford Expedition and Adams following in her black BMW. Carruth came to an abrupt halt on an abandoned road when the hit men whom he hired pulled up alongside Adams and opened fire. Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what? You earned it! You triple-earned it. You deserve it [the Weeknd voice]. You don\u2019t have a truth anymore. You gave that up on Nov. 16, 1999. In fact, inmates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write their victims or have their pleas for understanding publicized.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back. I believe in rehabilitation, but this letter proves that Carruth hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s still the self-involved, narcissistic shit heel that thought he could orchestrate the murder of his child\u2019s mother and get away with it.\n\nCarruth son\u2019s lives on despite Carruth\u2019s best efforts to take his life, and he\u2019s doing just fine with his grandmother.

Adams\u2019 unborn son would survive but was born with cerebral palsy.

You can read it below:\n\nThankfully, because God is still guiding the way, no matter how much hatred the Trump administration spouts, Carruth now knows that staying out of his son\u2019s life is the best move. Last month, Carruth wrote a 16-page self-serving apology that he sent to a television station, claiming that his son\u2019s grandmother had been spreading false stories about him. It was a stark contrast from the four-page, 800-word letter he recently sent to the Charlotte Observer noting that he recognizes that not being around would be in \u201ceveryone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor all involved or invested in this ordeal, please calm down,\u201d Carruth wrote to Observer reporter Scott Fowler. \u201cI will no longer be pursuing a relationship with Chancellor and Ms. Adams. I promise to leave them be, which I now see is in everyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nTiffany Shears-Trice, a spokesperson for the Carruth family, who holds the ex-NFL player\u2019s power of attorney, told the newspaper that the former wide receiver is \u201cjust trying to do the right thing here with the Adams family and not disrupt anyone\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cRae can see Chancellor is a happy, healthy soul and he doesn\u2019t want to interfere with that,\u201d Shears-Trice said. \u201cBut he will still live up to his financial responsibilities for his son\u2014he definitely wants to do that and he will do that. He wants to help.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Post notes that \u201cSaundra Adams was awarded nearly $5.8 million in damages in a wrongful death lawsuit in 2003, but she said she\u2019s received hardly any money from that judgment since the four men convicted in the plot have been imprisoned or unemployed since that time.\u201d\n\nDuring his stay in prison, Carruth become a barber and was earning roughly a dollar per day. A long way from his NFL days, when, the Post reports, Carruth was cashing game checks totaling nearly $40,000.\n\n\n\nCarruth apologized for \u201chaving the audacity to believe that there was ever a real place\u201d for him in Chancellor\u2019s life aside from afar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe may have called me \u2018Rae,\u2019 but I was really looking forward to giving him a dad,\u201d Carruth wrote.\n\nMan, fuck this guy.

Just check out these hits:\n\n\n\nWho can forget Romney calling Trump a phony and a fraud during the 2016 presidential election season?\n\nOr the remix version, when brave Romney called Trump a comforter of and cheerleader for racists after the president\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack? From Facebook:\n\nWhether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn. His apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the feeling was mutual. Donald Trump holds a lot of grudges against Mitt Romney.\n\nHe\u2019s never forgiven Romney for calling him a fraud and a phony; he was furious that prominent Republicans wanted Romney to run as a third-party candidate in 2016; and last, Trump probably can\u2019t get over the fact that even though they\u2019re only a year apart in age, Romney\u2019s mane is always perfectly laid, while Trump\u2019s head looks like he\u2019s had more implants than Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemonstrating the penchant for pettiness that has defined his presidency, Trump spent the first few months after the election engaging in an elaborate Lucy-and-the-football scheme, with Romney doing the most earnest Charlie Brown impression possible. And after months of publicly wining and dining Romney, Trump turned around and gave the job of secretary of state to Rex Tillerson, a Russian-business crony with less experience than on Romney\u2019s pre-Massachusetts r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough; late last year, Trump actively tried to block Romney from running for Senate. In other words, if Romney had even the slightest drop of personal integrity, or even cared about his brand as the moral opposite of Trump, or wanted to keep those rumors alive that he might actually primary Trump in 2020, he\u2019d stick to his guns like he did in 2016, right? He would run for Utah Senate as the anti-Trump or at least make it clear that he was his own man.\n\nExcept no. Mitt Romney is a spineless, craven politician thirsty for any semblance of relevance after America rejected his brand of disingenuous, sanctimonious leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny dreams that he would stand up to Trump (and those had to be drug-induced fantasies born of nothing more than an unrealistic faith in a politician who said that 47 percent of the country wasn\u2019t worth talking to) went out the window when he tweeted this on Monday:\n\nMind you, Trump has never apologized or changed his tune about Charlottesville; within the last week, more women have come out to accuse him of sexual improprieties; and he was defending an alleged abusive spouse less than two weeks ago\u2014and that was after he wholeheartedly endorsed a man accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, now Romney is proud to have this endorsement that was supposedly too awful to accept two years ago. I would say that the voters of Utah deserve better, but they elected Mia Love, so there is that.\n\nI think conservatives deserve better, because if they actually want to run someone for the Senate who will at least morally stand up to Trump, they might want to nominate someone who can at least get off his hands and knees first.", "keywords": ["politician", "election", "thirstiest", "week", "americas", "mitt", "presidential", "trump", "romney", "run", "utah", "senate", "2016"], "polarity": 0.14503375977256575, "subjectivity": 0.46543176972281447},

Carruth was a wide receiver with the Carolina Panthers and was casually dating Cherica Adams, who was seven months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child, which he wanted her to abort. Adams refused. So Carruth smooth-talked her into going to see The Bone Collector. Adams didn\u2019t feel right. She called her mother, who told her not to go. She went anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the movie, Carruth wanted to go back to Adams\u2019 place. So off they went, Carruth in his white Ford Expedition and Adams following in her black BMW. Carruth came to an abrupt halt on an abandoned road when the hit men whom he hired pulled up alongside Adams and opened fire. Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what? You earned it! You triple-earned it. You deserve it [the Weeknd voice]. You don\u2019t have a truth anymore. You gave that up on Nov. 16, 1999. In fact, inmates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write their victims or have their pleas for understanding publicized.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back. I believe in rehabilitation, but this letter proves that Carruth hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s still the self-involved, narcissistic shit heel that thought he could orchestrate the murder of his child\u2019s mother and get away with it.\n\nCarruth son\u2019s lives on despite Carruth\u2019s best efforts to take his life, and he\u2019s doing just fine with his grandmother.

Gee, I must\u2019ve struck a nerve, @AprilDRyan! #BankruptBlogger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout an hour later, Patton came to her senses, tweeting out an apology.\n\n\u201cI deleted my last tweet by choice. No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote in the tweet. \u201cMy parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apology came a little too late, though. Because, remember, Ryan is really not the one you should try. This is the same reporter who has fearlessly stood her ground amid the disrespect she has faced while reporting on the Trump administration. This is the same reporter who casually asked Donald Trump \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at the White House.\n\nSo naturally, Ryan responded with a swift and expert level of clapback-ery that had me clutching at my pearls and probably made Queen Rihanna of Clapbacks proud.\n\nFirst, because Ryan is a classy reporter, she of course had to fact-check Patton. She basically pulled a #FakeNews on a Trump official, and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, when you\u2019re an event planner suddenly turned housing official, there are some receipts that have to be read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, leaving no stone unturned, as a proper reporter should, especially in a dragging, Ryan hit her with the \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d while seamlessly @ing Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been accused of threatening Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, with a Mariah Carey level of shade, she wrapped it all up with a smooth, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nBut seriously, all drama aside, it is unthinkable that an official representing a presidential administration would conduct herself that way. Then again, everything is unprecedented and game in this administration, it seems, so perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, political pundit Armstrong Williams tweeted out to Ryan that he had spoken to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a longtime friend, who had attempted to reach out to Ryan on Thursday morning to apologize.\n\nRyan missed the call but is sure to follow up because, again\u2014and hopefully for the last time so these people can know\u2014April Ryan is NOT the one.", "keywords": ["official", "reporter", "administration", "test", "housing", "ryan", "realizes", "really", "piggy", "miss", "calling", "trump", "patton", "tries", "hud", "apologize", "late"], "polarity": 0.03126306165099268, "subjectivity": 0.4200148032044584},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["survivors", "fla", "far", "right", "used", "aide", "school", "students", "shooting", "douglas", "parkland", "reform", "stoneman", "state", "seeking", "gun", "theories"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

Last month, Carruth wrote a 16-page self-serving apology that he sent to a television station, claiming that his son\u2019s grandmother had been spreading false stories about him. It was a stark contrast from the four-page, 800-word letter he recently sent to the Charlotte Observer noting that he recognizes that not being around would be in \u201ceveryone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor all involved or invested in this ordeal, please calm down,\u201d Carruth wrote to Observer reporter Scott Fowler. \u201cI will no longer be pursuing a relationship with Chancellor and Ms. Adams.

A long way from his NFL days, when, the Post reports, Carruth was cashing game checks totaling nearly $40,000.\n\n\n\nCarruth apologized for \u201chaving the audacity to believe that there was ever a real place\u201d for him in Chancellor\u2019s life aside from afar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe may have called me \u2018Rae,\u2019 but I was really looking forward to giving him a dad,\u201d Carruth wrote.\n\nMan, fuck this guy.

He was arrested near Johannesburg in July 1963 alongside other ANC leaders. That arrest led to the Rivonia trial in which eight of the accused, including Mandela, were convicted of treason and sentenced to life in prison with hard labor. Kathrada was later released from prison in October 1989 at the age of 60.\n\nAfter his release, he was elected as a member of parliament and married anti-apartheid activist Barbara Hogan, who also served time in jail for treason against the racist apartheid government.\n\nAccording to AP, more recently in his life, Kathrada was an outspoken critic of current South African President Jacob Zuma, whose presidency has been tainted by scandals involving corruption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast April, South Africa\u2019s highest court ruled that Zuma had violated his oath of office by refusing to obey an order that required him to pay back public money that was spent upgrading his rural home.

Carruth was a wide receiver with the Carolina Panthers and was casually dating Cherica Adams, who was seven months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child, which he wanted her to abort. Adams refused. So Carruth smooth-talked her into going to see The Bone Collector. Adams didn\u2019t feel right. She called her mother, who told her not to go. She went anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the movie, Carruth wanted to go back to Adams\u2019 place. So off they went, Carruth in his white Ford Expedition and Adams following in her black BMW. Carruth came to an abrupt halt on an abandoned road when the hit men whom he hired pulled up alongside Adams and opened fire. Adams survived long enough to tell police that Carruth set the whole thing up. She died and her son, Chancellor Lee Adams, lived, but not without difficulties. For some time he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen and blood to his brain and was born with cerebral palsy.\n\nCarruth was sentenced to 18-24 years in prison for his role in Adams\u2019 death. Adams\u2019 mother, Saundra Adams, was given custody of her grandson and has raised him, taken him to endless doctor\u2019s appointments, stayed up countless hours watching him sleep.\n\n\n\nChancellor Lee Adams turned 18 in November. And his father, the father who wanted him dead, is set to get out of prison in October 2018.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, after the role that he played in the murder of his son\u2019s mother, after the endless bills and constant worry that comes with raising a son with special needs, Rae Carruth, the same man who pulled off shortly after watching the men he hired dumping bullets into his baby mama\u2019s car, has written a letter to his son\u2019s grandmother, the mother of the woman he had killed, claiming that she is soiling his name.\n\n\n\nI WISH THAT THERE WERE A FONT THAT WE COULD ALL AGREE ON TO SYMBOLIZE THE HATE THAT I FEEL FOR THIS NIGGA\u2019S AUDACITY, BUT I WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR ALL CAPS.\n\n\n\nTHE NIGGADACITY OF THIS NIGGA!!!\n\n\n\nCarruth writes:\n\n\n\nMs. Adams, the story of how you lost your daughter; how Chancellor came into this world; and the way that he has gone on to endure, thrive and overachieve with you by his side is so heart wrenching and inspiring on its own, that there isn\u2019t any need for embellishment or lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmm, Rae Carruth, if Ms. Adams wants to make up all the lies in Lieville about you, guess what? You earned it! You triple-earned it. You deserve it [the Weeknd voice]. You don\u2019t have a truth anymore. You gave that up on Nov. 16, 1999. In fact, inmates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to write their victims or have their pleas for understanding publicized.\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports, Carruth has grown so frustrated with the stories about his character and statements made by Saundra Adams that he sent a letter to news stations so that he could point out that he has tried to reach out to her.\n\n\n\nYou can read his letter here, but I suggest that you don\u2019t bother. It starts with self-deprecating humility, only to be usurped by his inability to understand that he killed Adams\u2019 daughter and inflicted irreversible damage on his son. The letter alone should be grounds to hold him in prison. Some people aren\u2019t redeemable, and Rae Carruth still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t put your fist through your computer yet, just know that Carruth actually believes not only that he should be able to have a relationship with his son but that he\u2019s entitled to it.\n\n\n\nI want Rae Carruth to become the first inmate who refuses to leave prison for the good of us all. I want him to just volunteer to stay in prison for the good of his son. I want him to take a long walk off a short pier and never come back. I believe in rehabilitation, but this letter proves that Carruth hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s still the self-involved, narcissistic shit heel that thought he could orchestrate the murder of his child\u2019s mother and get away with it.\n\nCarruth son\u2019s lives on despite Carruth\u2019s best efforts to take his life, and he\u2019s doing just fine with his grandmother.

Last month, Carruth wrote a 16-page self-serving apology that he sent to a television station, claiming that his son\u2019s grandmother had been spreading false stories about him. It was a stark contrast from the four-page, 800-word letter he recently sent to the Charlotte Observer noting that he recognizes that not being around would be in \u201ceveryone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor all involved or invested in this ordeal, please calm down,\u201d Carruth wrote to Observer reporter Scott Fowler. \u201cI will no longer be pursuing a relationship with Chancellor and Ms. Adams.

Already, the massive storm\u2014the largest ever recorded in the Atlantic\u2014is pummeling every island in the Caribbean that comes across its path. It is unclear just how much devastation it will bring, but forecasters and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have offered scenarios nothing short of terrifying.\n\nThis hurricane season has shown itself to be quite the nightmare, but one\u2019s fears only heighten after considering this nugget that makes this scenario all the more spine-chilling: Ben Carson is in charge of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, the brain surgeon who sounded like a damn fool throughout the entire Republican presidential primary season. To his credit, he sounded like a damn fool before the primary, given that he would do things like compare Obamacare to slavery, along with other random acts of asininity. Ben Carson, who often just stands there for decoration\u2014probably because he was a neurosurgeon and self-help-book writer who somehow became the head of a federal agency despite having no experience in government, much less housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in March, Carson gave his first speech to his new department and made HUD employees take a \u201cniceness pledge,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nDuring that same speech, he also said this, according to New York magazine:\n\n\u201cEvery human being, regardless of their ethnicities, or their background, they have a brain: the human brain. It remembers everything you\u2019ve ever seen, everything you\u2019ve ever heard. I could take the oldest person here, make a little hole right here on the side of the head, and put some depth electrodes into their hippocampus\u2014and stimulate\u2014and they would be able to read back to you, verbatim, a book they read 60 years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t overload the human brain,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cSo we need to focus a little less on what we can\u2019t do and a little more on what we can do. After all, this is America, the \u2018can-do society\u2019 \u2014 not the, \u2018what can you do for me\u2019 society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson\u2019s first speech was to ask employees to take a niceness pledge while arguing against government handouts. This nitwit didn\u2019t even pass his own pledge of kindness.\n\nA month later, Politico reported:\n\nCarson told Politico that policy proposals are in the works, but in public appearances the one-time presidential candidate is sticking to his stump-speech staples. He prescribes \u201cgodly principles\u201d as a cure for the country\u2019s political division and praises housing advocates for \u201cputting God\u2019s love into action.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of God, which I love to do; quite frankly, he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Carson said on March 28, drawing friendly laughter during a speech to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. \u201cWe should be grateful that God gave us variety. But you know what he didn\u2018t give us variety in? The brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe month after that, NPR reported:\n\nOn Wednesday night, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 whose budget to help low-income households would be cut by more than $6 billion next year \u2014 added his own thoughts. He said in a radio interview that \u201cpoverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.\u201d Carson \u2014 who himself grew up in poverty to become a widely acclaimed neurosurgeon \u2014 said people with the \u201cright mind set\u201d can have everything taken away from them, and they\u2019ll pull themselves up. He believes the converse is true as well. \u201cYou take somebody with the wrong mind-set, you can give them everything in the world [and] they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson tried to clarify his comments, but, spoiler, he repeated the same sentiment with phrasing that was the Tia to its original statement\u2019s Tamera. Not even Tahj or Tavior Mowry, but Tamera.\n\n\n\nOn the Monday following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall and the historic rainfall it quickly brought to Texas, Secretary Carson released a statement assuring that HUD would be there for victims in need.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] begins to assess the damage and respond to the immediate needs of residents, HUD will be there to offer assistance and support the longer-term housing recovery efforts,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat followed was a bulleted list of HUD\u2019s efforts, but one wonders, can Carson get any of it done? This question is spurred not only by Carson\u2019s own past remarks but also by a new report outlining just how poorly run HUD is under Carson\u2019s leadership.\n\nDays before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ProPublica published \u201cIs Anybody Home at HUD?,\u201d which highlighted the decimation of a vital federal agency under Carson.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis noted that now-former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d back in February. The administration\u2019s initial budget called for deep cuts to HUD\u2014cuts the Washington Post\u2019s Lisa Rein highlights \u201cwould slice away funding for long-term preparedness efforts, many of them put in place to address the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 45 picked the perfect person to run an agency for which he and those around him have great disdain.\n\nAs MacGillis reports, the plan is going exactly as it is designed:\n\nAs I watched the hearings, it occurred to me that Carson was the perfect HUD secretary for Donald Trump, the real-estate-developer president who appears to care little for public housing. He offered a gently smiling refutation to accusations from any corner that the department\u2019s evisceration would have grave consequences. After all, Ben Carson had made it from Detroit to Johns Hopkins without housing assistance, a point of pride in his family. Not to mention that Carson\u2019s very identity \u2014 theoretically \u2014 helped inoculate the administration against charges of prejudice. (Just last week, Carson said, in the wake of racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, that the controversy over Trump\u2019s support of white supremacists there was \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d and echoed the president\u2019s \u201cboth sides\u201d language when referring to \u201chatred and bigotry.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd like 45, Carson keeps family around where they don\u2019t belong:\n\nThen there was the mystery of why Carson\u2019s family was taking such a visible role in the department. There was the omnipresent Mrs. Carson. Even more striking, however, had been the active role of the secretary\u2019s second-oldest son. Ben Carson Jr., who goes by B.J. and co-founded an investment firm in Columbia, Maryland, that specializes in infrastructure, health care and workforce development, was showing up on email chains within the department and appearing often at headquarters. One day, he was seen leaving the 10th-floor office of David Eagles, the new COO, who was crafting a HUD reorganization to accompany the cuts.\n\nAn anonymous source told ProPublica of Carson: \u201cPeople feel disrespected. They see Carson and think, I\u2019ve been in housing policy for 20 or 30 years, and if I walked away, I would never expect to get hired as a nurse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Carson is a religious zealot who makes the mistake of personalizing poverty in a way that is detrimental to those who know that for every rarity that is Ben Carson, there are many others who continue to languish in a system designed to keep them stuck where they are.\n\nIn reality, more often than not, people have to be given opportunities to get out of poverty. They need adequate housing, they need support and they need a helping hand. Even if Carson is a brain surgeon who doubles as a village idiot, one would think even he would understand that the difference between him and the man who gave him a job for which he is unqualified had everything handed to him\u2014which promised him a much more certain fate than Carson had as a child.\n\n\n\nIt was already worrisome that a man who thinks poverty is a state of mind was in charge of an organization designed to help the poorest among us. It\u2019s even worse now that the poorest of Houston have been affected by a natural disaster, only to seek refuge in an organization that lacks staffing, resources and competency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHUD is supposed to rebuild homes, parks, hospitals and community centers. Carson behaves as if he couldn\u2019t build a paper plane at his office in their building. How petrified should most of them be?\n\nIn response to the story, Carson said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 Special Report: \u201cI would say that you should ring the doorbell before you conclude that nobody\u2019s at home. I don\u2019t think they did a very good job at journalistic investigation there.\u201d\n\nWell, this is your chance to show and prove, you brain-dead brain surgeon. I don\u2019t have much faith in you, but for the sake of my home state of Texas, Florida and whatever other areas are affected, I\u2019m praying you don\u2019t fuck up.\n\n", "keywords": ["carson", "brain", "petrified", "poverty", "speech", "need", "ben", "head", "victims", "hurricane", "state", "hud", "housing"], "polarity": 0.11839024423136571, "subjectivity": 0.449990424943696},

But the truth is, the network has been slowly working at this for years. And history, not music, has been the main driver when it comes to the miniseries that air on the network.\n\n\n\nReportedly, great viewer reception to the reairing of Roots, as well as Roots: The Next Generations, Roots: The Gift and Queen back in 2012, helped BET join forces with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. to produce The Book of Negroes.\n\nBased on a novel by Canadian author Lawrence Hill, the miniseries aired to some acclaim in 2015. Hill built his impactful work around the actual Book of Negroes, a historical record of enslaved Africans who helped the British and were granted their freedom in Nova Scotia. And this year, BET is keeping the momentum going with Madiba.\n\nStarring Laurence Fishburne as the internationally celebrated freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, Madiba, which airs over three weeks\u2014Feb. 1, 8 and 15\u2014is based on two Mandela autobiographies: Conversations With Myself and Nelson Mandela by Himself. It was filmed in South Africa, including Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for nearly three decades. The Kevin Hooks-directed miniseries is touted as one of the most personal portrayals of Mandela to date, as well as the first major production about the legend helmed by an African-American director.\n\nProductions about Mandela\u2014who rose from being a leading anti-apartheid activist with the African National Congress, resulting in a lengthy imprisonment, to become South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected and first black president\u2014have been prominent. In 2013 Idris Elba starred as the icon in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Morgan Freeman famously played the great leader in the soccer-themed Invictus, directed by Clint Eastwood, in 2009. And Terrence Howard got a shot at portraying him in Winnie Mandela, the T.D. Jakes-produced film about Mandela\u2019s famous second wife starring Jennifer Hudson, released in 2013. And now Fishburne, who is best-known these days as Pops from the ABC hit sitcom Black-ish, is taking his turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe miniseries spans the period from Mandela\u2019s life as a child until his historic election as president. Except for a very brief time, the 55-year-old Fishburne plays Mandela from roughly his mid-20s until his mid-70s. As strong an actor as Fishburne is, this move doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for the first installment of the miniseries. But as it plays on, the story and his age gel more.\n\nAlso, unlike other Mandela productions, his comrades are particularly prominent. So fellow ANC activists such as Walter Sisulu, who is credited with bringing Mandela into the ANC and is played by David Harewood from the series Supergirl, as well as nonblack comrades Joe Slovo (Jason Kennett), Ahmed Kathrada (Meren Reddy) and Ruth First (Kate Liquorish), make an appearance.\n\nOrlando Jones, who plays Mandela\u2019s law partner and closest friend, Oliver Tambo, is surprisingly outstanding\u2014actually, unrecognizably so. It may take a while for Drumline\u2019s Dr. Lee to register, if he ever registers at all. Terry Pheto, who plays Winnie, is the rare black South African in a prominent role, and she is particularly compelling, especially in the final installment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those familiar with Mandela\u2019s history and that of the ANC, there will be no real surprises. Madiba\u2014\u201cMadiba\u201d is Mandela\u2019s Xhosa name (Xhosa is South Africa\u2019s second-largest ethnic group after the Zulus)\u2014is a pretty faithful history, capturing key moments like Mandela\u2019s early rise to prominence; his role in radicalizing the ANC; his Rivonia trial, which sent him and his comrades to Robben Island; his time at Robben Island, as well as the Sharpeville massacre in 1960; the Soweto student uprising in 1976; the questionable death of popular leader Steve Biko; and the assassination of youth leader Chris Hani.\n\nA recurring theme is the stress Mandela\u2019s activism placed on his wives and children. It is very clear that Mandela\u2019s activism came at a huge personal price. The increasing tension between him and Winnie is particularly compelling.\n\n\n\nWhile BET should certainly be commended for stepping up to the original-programming plate in such a big way and for recognizing the need to tell historic black stories of the United States and the African continent, a Madiba miniseries exploring Mandela\u2019s presidency, the changing South Africa and his death might have been a better approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not that this one isn\u2019t of value. After all, if U.S. schools barely teach black American history, they certainly don\u2019t teach South African history. And one of the most enlightening aspects of Madiba is the obvious parallels it makes to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the rise of black nationalism in this country. At times, Mandela is both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, but toward the end he is a little Obama, too.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the folks at BET are banking that, when it comes to anything Mandela, they just can\u2019t go wrong. And here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re right.\n\nMadiba airs on BET on Feb. 1, 8 and 15 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT.", "keywords": ["fishburne", "anc", "icon", "south", "mandelas", "history", "laurence", "starring", "mandela", "plays", "madiba", "african", "bets", "bet", "black", "class", "miniseries", "session"], "polarity": 0.13825716477615219, "subjectivity": 0.4903770069592853},

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S. While we understand that all of the victims and the activists werent exclusively white, we all know why the country is listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do, too.", "keywords": ["things", "america", "change", "teen", "youre", "nra", "lives", "white", "activists", "efforts", "black", "dear", "walmart", "ask", "gun", "control"], "polarity": 0.030929592959295947, "subjectivity": 0.43710042432814694},

Recently the Michigan Chronicle, a historically black newspaper from Ben Carson\u2019s hometown of Detroit, referred to Carson as the \u201cshame of Detroit\u201d and said that he was in competition for the \u201cHouse Negro of the Year Award.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain didn\u2019t take too kindly to that, and the former Republican presidential candidate wrote a post on his website blasting the paper for using the term.\n\nHe took it a step further on Wednesday when he wrote another post, titled, \u201cHouse Negroes Stand Up!\u201d in which he laments that he, too, has been referred to as a house Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey say it to me too, Dr. Ben Carson, because just like you, I refuse to embrace the backward thinking of today\u2019s black identity politics,\u201d Cain writes.\n\nHe goes on to say that since the Chronicle thinks Carson is a house Negro, then he, Cain, must be one, too, because that\u2019s \u201cone of the names you get called by other black people when you are a success at something, and you do not buy into \u2018black group think\u2019 or act and say what they want you to say.\u201d\n\nNo, sir, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite how that moniker is earned, but please, continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain then goes on to criticize the current movement to have Confederate monuments removed, calling it a \u201cwaste of time and distractions,\u201d and saying that the Chronicle may not have noticed the \u201csuccessful black people\u201d in \u201cprominent positions in America\u201d because they mind their business like the good black folk they are, focusing on \u201cperformance and productive opportunities\u201d rather than worrying about the past.\n\nOK.\n\nThen Cain gets all \u201cHe won\u2019t say it, but I will,\u201d like he is really about to read someone or something, and says:\n\nGentle Dr. Ben Carson is too nice to respond to that garbage article and name-calling by the Michigan Chronicle, but I\u2019m not! Let\u2019s start with the fact that he prayed hard about even accepting the HUD job. Personally, I was glad he accepted it, because he will bring \u201coutside the box\u201d ideas and thinking to HUD. Many of the old ways of doing things have left many of our urban areas unchanged for 50 years, and too many of our young people have been trapped in cycles of poverty, crime and weak educations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh? Have we witnessed any of this so-called outside-the-box thinking and ideas? What has Carson brought to the table since joining the Department of Housing and Urban Development?\n\nCain then stresses for us that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t become a world-renowned brain surgeon by being a \u2018house Negro,\u2019\u201d but I don\u2019t think anyone has made that allegation, so I think this is another instance of you keep using that phrase, but I don\u2019t think you understand what it means, Herman.\n\nHe writes that Carson could have taken any other \u201cbetter paying and less stressful\u201d job in the world, but he chose to \u201cserve his country and a president who is truly trying to create a better America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is where I have to stop you for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Carson is not making some huge sacrifice for other Americans, and most especially not for other black Americans, so let\u2019s just be real about that.\n\nSecond, Donald Trump is not trying to create a better America for anyone who looks like you, you misguided darkie. Like, for real, for real. Get your head out of your ass and wake up. You acting real Stacey Dash right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continues:\n\nThe Michigan Chronicle thanks Dr. Carson for his sacrifice and dedication by calling him a nasty insulting name. It\u2019s the usual attempt to try to discredit his patriotism and to discourage him.

A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools.

Should the vaccine prove to be even 50 percent effective, that would be sufficient for drugmakers to begin licensing negotiations with the South African government.\n\nThe Post notes that about 5,400 people\u2014who must be HIV-negative, sexually active, and between the ages of 18 and 35\u2014are being recruited for the trial.

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ... Never feeling like that must be the ultimate privilege.\n\nBut then again, I am a black man ...\n\nAn apology.", "keywords": ["culture", "love", "french", "article", "david", "weapon", "sweet", "safe", "white", "sentient", "atlantic", "feel", "black", "privilege", "carry", "gun", "man"], "polarity": 0.06059433621933622, "subjectivity": 0.4263154761904762},

Cory Booker\u2019s representatives contacted us to say that T-Bone is a real person.\n\nDonald Trump has an imaginary friend named Jim. Ben Carson not only invented a fake friend, but then he stabbed his fake friend in an argument.\n\n\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda. And even after \u201cthe friend\u201d is exposed and is proved to be as authentic as Kim Kardashian\u2019s ass, it doesn\u2019t seem to stop the politician\u2019s advancement; on the contrary, the imagined political friend has just become the way of a real political life.\n\n\n\nThe imaginary friend as a political ploy works like this: There is no friend, but there is a point that needs to be made, and since someone around the country has experienced such hardship about said point, that experience is personified and personalized in the form of a friend\u2014a friend who doesn\u2019t exist but who suffers from real American, first world problems. This is the crux of how America has allowed the influx of imaginary friends into the political landscape and, thus, political lexicon.\n\nDuring a speech in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Trump claimed that he had a friend named Jim.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend; he\u2019s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights. He loves Paris. For years, every year, during the summer, he would go to Paris, it was automatic, with his wife and his family,\u201d Trump said, CNN notes.\n\nTrump added, \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in a while. And I said, \u2018Jim, let me ask you a question: How\u2019s Paris doing?\u201d Trump recalled. \u201c\u2018Paris? I don\u2019t go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out that Jim doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump does this a lot, conjuring friends who don\u2019t exist. He claims that someone close to him has something to say, and that something is always in alignment with Trump\u2019s feelings. But that\u2019s because Trump is pathological. He\u2019s an ill-equipped communicator on the world stage and hardly trying to be loved. And never forget that Trump\u2019s agenda is always to push separatism, so he uses his imaginary friends for just such a reason.\n\nBut not all imaginary friends are the same; nor do they serve the same purpose. While Trump\u2019s friend Jim was used to send an anecdotal message about what happens when you open up the borders of a country, Booker and Carson have invented or embellished friends for quite a different reason: inclusion.\n\nWhen Cory Booker, now a senator from New Jersey, was mayor of Newark, N.J., he spoke of T-Bone. T-Bone was a ruthless drug lord from Jersey\u2019s Brick Towers low-income housing development who once threatened to kill Booker. T-Bone was also mentioned whenever Booker was trying to sell a story of how he understood the woes of growing up in a tough city like Newark. T-Bone became both Booker\u2019s hood pass and his mentee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how T-Bone was first introduced during a 2007 speech at the New School in New York City, according to NJ.com:\n\n\u201cI said hello to this guy and I\u2019ll never forget he leaped off the steps where he was standing and looked at me and threatened my life,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI later got to know this guy and his name was T-Bone and I\u2019m a vegetarian so that was a particularly vicious threat,\u201d Booker said to big laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker would later claim that T-Bone would come to him for legal advice.\n\nAfter being called out about T-Bone\u2019s legitimacy, Booker noted that T-Bone was real. Whether or not his name is actually T-Bone, though, has yet to be proved.\n\n\u201cHe is an archetype of so many people that are out there. He is 1,000 percent a real person,\u201d Booker said in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen NJ.com explored why people didn\u2019t call out Booker\u2019s questionable use of T-Bone, a telling answer came from Rahaman Muhammad, a city union leader who at the time was one of Booker\u2019s strongest critics.\n\n\u201cHe actually has real experiences that he can share,\u201d Muhammad told NJ.com. \u201cTo me this does not disqualify him from being a U.S. senator. These are urban stories that many of us have in this city. There may be different names, but there are many of these types of stories. Unfortunately, he made up a character for his story.\u201d\n\nNo politician, however, has done as masterly a job of deploying this narrative as former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, now secretary of housing and urban development. During his failed run for the White House, Carson weaved tales of debauchery and street toughness as if he were the black Chuck Norris. He once claimed that he stopped a stickup merely by pointing the robber toward the cash register. Most black people knew he was lying because he said that the alleged robbery attempt happened at a \u201cPopeyes organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is how CNN described Carson\u2019s tall tales:\n\nIn his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, Carson describes those acts as flowing from an uncontrollable \u201cpathological temper.\u201d The violent episodes he has detailed in his book, in public statements and in interviews, include punching a classmate in the face with his hand wrapped around a lock, leaving a bloody three-inch gash in the boy\u2019s forehead; attempting to attack his own mother with a hammer following an argument over clothes; hurling a large rock at a boy, which broke the youth\u2019s glasses and smashed his nose; and, finally, thrusting a knife at the belly of his friend with such force that the blade snapped when it luckily struck a belt buckle covered by the boy\u2019s clothes. \u201cI was trying to kill somebody,\u201d Carson said, describing the incident\u2014which he has said occurred at age 14 in ninth grade\u2014during a September forum at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. But nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson told CNN they have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is from a Yale-educated brain surgeon! The saddest part here is that Carson didn\u2019t feel that being one of the most decorated neurosurgeons was enough. He still needed a phoenixlike rise from the ashes of a hood like Baltimore to add legitimacy to his narrative.\n\nUnlike Trump, who is habitually horrible and is using everything at his disposal to destroy America, Booker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will\u2014for the crowd to show that they can move freely within both worlds.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a conundrum that all educated black men face: What do degrees mean inside the barbershop, and what does barbershop talk mean inside the hallowed halls of an Ivy League school? The funniest part of both Carson\u2019s and Booker\u2019s tales is that even in their use, they actually show how removed both men are.\n\n\u201cBlack men, almost by their very nature, have to perform. And Cory\u2014to some extent, the blackest part of him is that performance ethos,\u201d historian Clement Price told Esquire back in 2008 about Booker\u2019s friend T-Bone. The same could apply to Carson.\n\nBooker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imaginary friend in Carson\u2019s narrative and Booker\u2019s exploratory use of T-Bone helps bolster their respective street cred, and in some regards, a politician needs street cred almost as much as a rapper does. When stumping for office, a politician needs stories that show not only that he will he lead the people but also that he is of the people. That he\u2019s one of them. That he, too, has had to fend off drug dealers.\n\nAnd so, in a weird, political way, the story of T-Bone becomes a Dickensian tale about the downturn of life, and serves as the foil to Booker the protagonist and his uplifting bootstraps. T-Bone serves an anecdotal purpose in the same way that we don\u2019t know if there was ever a real Brenda in Tupac\u2019s life, but we know that \u201cshe barely had a brain\u201d and that is was \u201ca damn shame that the girl could hardly spell her name.\u201d The \u201clife story\u201d somehow becomes the life.\n\nWe don\u2019t know Brenda, and nor do we care if she exists, but we know that Brenda speaks for a larger community, and that is what attracts us to Brenda\u2019s story. We know that she has struggled; we know that she is unable to handle the rigors of raising a newborn baby while still being a child herself. We feel for her. But in the end, it\u2019s a story, a fictional tale, an imagined hardship, a lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political landscape is changing, but the anecdotal story of a friend who once did something bad is as old as America itself. It has been employed by parents and teachers who warn of the bad kid who didn\u2019t listen and, as a result, ended up dead, so is it bad that politicians have not only employed fake friends but have mentored them, taken their advice, stabbed them in a rage-filled moment?\n\nThere is a theory that says it\u2019s OK to talk to an imaginary friend, but seek help should that friend start talking back.\n\nI think we may have jumped the shark.", "keywords": ["tbone", "political", "carson", "friends", "bookers", "friend", "donald", "booker", "trump", "imaginary", "ben", "real", "politicians", "know"], "polarity": -0.04338607752400856, "subjectivity": 0.44266924167786226},

And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter!

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["teachers", "forward", "program", "school", "moving", "especially", "students", "educators", "gun", "armed", "dangerous", "laws", "black", "legislature", "children", "approved", "florida", "schools"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there,\u201dthe Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cAnd you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, and before entering into politics, he was a motivational speaker. He regularly discussed the fact that he grew up in poverty, and Lifetime found his life story so compelling, the network turned it into the TV movie Gifted Hands, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. While the biopic set him up to be an inspiration to poor kids everywhere, his conservative politics, constant denunciations of government assistance and the way his foot is always in his mouth have made most people give him an extreme side eye.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments were made during a town hall recorded Tuesday to air in full Wednesday night, and clips of the interview were released to news organizations to promote the show, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson said \u201cthe wrong mindset\u201d is the product of negative parenting habits and exposure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a poverty spirit. You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the majority of people don\u2019t have that defeatist attitude, but they sometimes just don\u2019t see the way, and that\u2019s where government can come in and be very helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can provide the ladder of opportunity, it can provide the mechanism that will demonstrate to them what can be done.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint, unveiled Tuesday, would cut more than $6 billion from HUD\u2019s budget. The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that?

Bleak because the country\u2019s top public health organization is now prohibited from using the term \u201cscience-based.\u201d Bleak because we\u2019re surprised that a man accused of sexually harassing and assaulting young girls\u2014and who extols slavery\u2014lost an election. Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

One of Suckabee\u2019s few jobs is to translate for the devil, who, for years, has been losing some of his pigment, and instead of being red is just Cheetos-dust-colored.\n\n\n\nSo it makes sense that Suckabee is out here doing the non-Lord\u2019s work.

The comment came after the president criticized armed officers who didn\u2019t run into the school after hearing the commotion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The president is a gilded-chair quarterback.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life.

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["law", "health", "ranks", "celebrate", "nra", "mental", "enforcement", "gov", "proposed", "scott", "school", "weapons", "trump", "gun", "shouldnt", "yes", "florida", "rick"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law professor quoted in the Raw Story article, said, state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Story also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet-fuel-tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans had threatened to pull their support.\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, also responded to Cagle, criticizing the lieutenant governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon.com\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time magazine, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["raw", "delta", "nra", "tax", "biggest", "governor", "hes", "young", "threatening", "states", "wannabe", "loves", "state", "lawmakers", "second", "georgia", "employers", "cagle", "discounts"], "polarity": -0.020344635523206957, "subjectivity": 0.356445043052186},

Not to be confused with Betsy DeVos, the other clueless blonde hired by the Trump administration, Van Duyne is the two-term mayor of Irving, Texas, where she was the first woman to serve in that post. She was chosen for her new position by Carson, the former brain surgeon and Jesus superfan who doesn\u2019t believe in evolution (because it is \u201cencouraged by Satan\u201d) and who once said that the Bible takes precedence over the Constitution.\n\nVan Duyne, a longtime Islamophobe, has warned people about Muslim bogeymen seeking to destroy \u201cour freedoms,\u201d plot terrorist attacks and take our bacon away. Two years ago she convinced the Irving City Council to endorse a bill by a Texas state legislator that sought to stop Shariah law\u2014even though no one was advancing Shariah law. Although the bill did not specifically mention Islam, the Dallas Morning News reported that the wording of the proposed law was almost exactly like that of a bill that had been introduced a few years earlier to stop the influence of \u201clarge groups of Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nVan Duyne was also sued by Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Irving student who was arrested after he brought a clock to school and school officials thought it was a bomb, because ... you know ... his name is Ahmed Mohamed. Van Duyne rushed to Facebook to defend the police officers who arrested the 14-year-old (she later changed the post to make it not so anti-Muslim).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot satisfied with her besmirchment of the teenager, Beth Badass sat down with Glenn Beck to further defend the police officers and teachers and to blame it on the boy and, of course, President Barack Obama:\n\nWe\u2019ve heard more from the media than the child ever released to the police when we were asking him questions.

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison. Of course, Spelman College has Valerie Jarrett and Howard University has Kamala Harris.

He doesn\u2019t, by the way, but with the season at the midpoint the show has a lot of ground to cover so I guess it\u2019s for the best. We begin with a minstrel show, run by Mr. Cato Powell himself. The white audience has their racist expectations supplanted as the cast of all-black actors are actually dressed in white-face and are there to make fun of their audience\u2019s lower-classed brethren. Seems this crowd is only interested in the Ghost In The Shell flavored white-washing and they all decide to head for the doors. Cato could care less, he\u2019s laughing his black top-hat off up in the balcony like a light-skinned Statler and Waldorf.\n\nElizabeth Hawkes is still reeling from being hit in the face with a rock at last week\u2019s rally and she decides to calm her nerves by writing a poetic letter to William Still. Her iambic pentameter is cut short when Georgia\u2019s house is raided. These dudes don\u2019t have a search warrant and they don\u2019t seem to think they need an invitation. They\u2019re accusing everyone of harboring a fugitive of the law and somebody must have passed Rosalee some smelling salts because she springs to life just in time to hide behind the walls before the men search the place. Georgia is taken away and I\u2019m starting to think Elizabeth is the opposite of a good luck charm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe return to the gullah plantation with my girl Ernestine and the other slaves are showing her she\u2019s part of the family by publicly shaming her like they did with Clara a few episodes ago. They wanna know what drugs she was taking, why she tried to kill herself, her shoe size and where is Bucky and what has he had. Ernestine stands to her feet to address the crowd. She isn\u2019t buying what they\u2019re selling though and she proceeds to read them for filth for their hypocrisy. Clara is impressed by her epic mic drop and follows her down the shoreline to ask for another favor. Clara and her favors. Didn\u2019t you sleep with Ernestine\u2019s man? Clara wants to know how she can become a self-assured temptress who makes the master putty in her hand like rumor has it Mama Black Rose was able to do back home. Ernestine reluctantly obliges to Iyanla her life.\n\nCato is still having a grand old time after his latest Philadelphia Minstrel Show at the mansion. A friend of his, a white foreigner who isn\u2019t used to America\u2019s particular flavor of racism, warns Cato about courting danger from these northerners but apparently he\u2019s not over his breakup with Desi and he\u2019s acting erratic. Cato just wants to watch the world burn. Later on this cockiness almost gets him killed so he\u2019d be wise to be a bit more cunning with his revenge plots.\n\nGeorgia returns from the courthouse and hips Elizabeth to the fact that they need to move the \u201ccargo\u201d to a safer place because the block is hot the block is hot. Elizabeth tells her (and half of the damn neighborhood) that she knows that Georgia\u2019s been \u201cpassing\u201d. Um, ok. It had never dawned on me that the actress playing this character was supposed to be anything but a black woman with a light complexion and friends in high places. This is an interesting tangential storyline for Underground to tackle and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, Detective Stabler\u2019s been locked up in the Special Victim\u2019s Unit eating his food like a toddler when in walks Patty with her smarmy-ass face. She has a proposition for him: track down and capture the Black Rose in exchange for his freedom. Not like he has much of a choice. After giving him a bath and a shave they head out to Philadelphia to crash Cato\u2019s white party. In attendance is William Still and the infamous Frederick Douglass played by show executive producer John Legend. Legend has shown he has the chops to handle the performance but my mind kept coming back to those \u201cBecause Of Them We Can\u201d memes where a kid dresses up like they\u2019re favorite black hero. (Sorry, Chrissy. Please don\u2019t drag me on Twitter. Actually, do. It would earn me so many cool points.)\n\nThis was more of a cameo for Legend and shoutout to the hair and makeup department for giving Legend the same blow-out I get when I try to blow-dry my hair on a humid day. It will be interesting to see if he makes a return in the coming episodes. Cato gets some news that his old London colleague has just arrived and he\u2019s brought a plus one! He has his henchman politely send his guests home so that he can converse with the dastardly Patty and her silent partner, August Pullman. Even though the two are outgunned they quickly lay waste to Cato\u2019s henchman and they force information out of him. Well, more like \u201casked one time\u201d and he sang like a canary. Oh, look! It\u2019s Desi! Great timing, girl.\n\nAs Elizabeth escorts the leader of the abolitionists via carriage with the \u201ccargo\u201d they are ambushed by a couple of KKK Kosplayers. They tie Lizzy up to a tree and threaten her with a knife as she screams for them to \u201cdo it!\u201d I was all like, \u201cGirl, bye\u201d until I remembered her husband did just die. Plus that eye jammy. She deserved that cathartic cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of tears, somebody must have been cutting up onions in my room because Noah is back from Philly and he and Rosalee finally get their reunion scene. The two of them haven\u2019t been together since a quick glance in episode one and it\u2019s presumably been a few months. When I tell you I cried! I know these are fictional characters and all but to think of everything Noah\u2019s been through just to be able to finally give Rosalee that ring. Good Lawt! After a wonderful speech to Elizabeth about carrying Noah\u2019s baby Rosalee chickens out about telling him even though she\u2019s showing out the wazoo. She does let him know she has plans for a trip back down to the Macon plantation to rescue her family on Christmas day and she wants Noah to go back down to Georgia with her. He\u2019s at first a little reluctant but he\u2019s so impressed by how headstrong and courageous she\u2019s become he finds it hard to oppose. My only gripe would be that the scenes could have been given more time to breathe before it cut away to something else but I guess time and production schedules wait for no man.\n\nBack on the gullah plantation Ernestine has been giving away all our womanly secrets on how to catch a man. Step 1: Shuddup and indulge his ego. Step 2: See Step 1. Ernestine has for the moment gotten her footing back and she kicks Hicks and all the generational cycles of abuse to the curb. \u2018Stine\u2019s plan works as Clara is able to seduce the master\u2019s son. Clara is so excited about the news, envisioning an easier life for herself when Ernestine tells baby girl the real plan is for her to use those pretty eyes to get her off Gullah Gullah Island.\n\nLooks like a Christmas family reunion is in the works!\n\nJordan Kauwling is an early thirties Philadelphian but she tells everyone she's in her late thirties because she doesn't understand how math works.

About a year ago, though, I inadvertently behaved like the kind of people I have written about. The kind who more or less profess to be \u201cslaved out.\u201d\n\n\n\nI received an email from a publicist about a new WGN America series titled Underground. The show was described as a 10-episode, hourlong vehicle that would take \u201cviewers on a pulse-pounding journey with revolutionaries of the Underground Railroad and [tell] the unflinching story of a group of courageous men and women who band together for the fight of their lives\u2014for their families, their future and their freedom.\u201d\n\nI put my fist in the air, but I wasn\u2019t ready to commit.\n\nUnderground, which debuted last March, enjoyed record-breaking ratings for WGN America (pushing its average ratings up 1,000 percent) and managed to perform well through the season finale. Clearly, it built a sizable and committed fan base for a reason. Even so, I told myself that I would get to it when I got to it\u2014like a student loan payment from time to time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t make a real effort to watch the show until days after Sweet Potato Saddam was elected president. I lasted all of seven minutes before I turned it off and continued my timeout from white folks. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint Jurnee Smollett-Bell, who stars as Rosalee on the show and whom I have adored since the short-lived On Our Own and the impeccable Eve\u2019s Bayou. Same for John Legend, who serves as an executive producer and will appear on camera in the second season.\n\nBut hey, they\u2019re black; I\u2019m sure they could understand. In hindsight, I now have a better understanding of why some may be reluctant to watch anything slavery-related. As much as slavery is a part of American history, asking marginalized people to revisit past trauma as they grapple with their own is a lot. Wanting to not revisit certain aspects of history when solely trying to be entertained does not mean one is disregarding it completely.\n\nThat said, after having finally watched the first season of Underground, I can admit that I have cheated myself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show is fantastic. The acting is phenomenal. The scripts are well-written. Everything is well-shot, and there are little details found in each episode that suggest a lot of thought went into making this show as authentic as possible.\n\nAlso, what makes Underground different from most slavery-themed works is that while the realities of slavery are not glossed over, in terms of narrative, this show is much more akin to your typical television drama than it is to 12 Years a Slave. As The Atlantic\u2019s Vann R. Newkirk II notes of Underground, \u201cThe first season owed a debt to The Walking Dead as much as it did to Roots.\u201d\n\nAnd in an interview with Newkirk, Legend had this to say about critics who argue we may be overwrought with slave narratives:\n\nPeople talk to us about it, and I know it was a concern that was brought up. But I knew the focus of this show wasn\u2019t just to have another portrayal of the misery of slavery, but to show the power of resistance, the power of fighting for freedom, and the inspiration it can give all of us now. No one wants to wallow in the toughest parts of slavery for a five-season series. That would\u2019ve been a hard thing for me to sell, and I didn\u2019t want to sell that kind of show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of Legend\u2019s remarks ring true, though there is something else that makes this show sparkle in a way that\u2019s different from other slave-centered films and television specials I have seen.\n\nTake my favorite character, Ernestine, played by Amirah Vann. Although she functions in the house as both mammy and mistress, you also see her as this person in control as much as possible, given the circumstances. You understand why she does the things she does even when she appears to be in the wrong. You come to learn why she acts in certain ways, why it\u2019s so important for the survival of her and her kids, and all of it makes you want to root for her.\n\nIn the season 2 opener, while you see Ernestine struggle with being sold to another plantation, you see she still finds a way to show her sexuality outside of appeasement to her master. You also see what happens to her now that she is broken, alone and lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is misery there, but there\u2019s a humanity pronounced in her character and, by extension, all of the other characters. And though sometimes it\u2019s somewhat unexpected (yet it works) to watch slaves dance to tracks from contemporary acts like the Weeknd, even that shows black people making the most of a terrible situation. Seeing those bits of joy and life on Underground makes all the difference because, honestly, I couldn\u2019t take 10 hours of \u201cMassa beat me\u201d when I have to deal with Minute Maid Mao wrecking my morning with each new tweet.\n\nPut it like this: Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III might love the Confederacy, but he wouldn\u2019t get jiggy with this show. Ben Carson apparently has no idea what slavery is, so he\u2019d call it a great immigrant story featuring nice white people he hopes will give him another job he has no business having.\n\nSeriously, I know many have been wary, but if you have not watched Underground already, hurry up and catch up. It is one of the finest shows on television and deserves all the attention it can get. I must also note that this show has managed to reunite me with WGN America, a network I have not watched since The Bozo Show.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 2 of Underground premieres Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT on WGN America.", "keywords": ["watch", "wgn", "america", "watched", "tale", "youre", "slave", "television", "season", "slavery", "stellar", "makes", "slaved", "underground", "kind"], "polarity": 0.14062833811210435, "subjectivity": 0.536839873690523},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["legal", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras", "terrorist", "deaths", "second", "directly", "organization", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["law", "health", "ranks", "celebrate", "nra", "mental", "enforcement", "gov", "proposed", "scott", "school", "weapons", "trump", "gun", "shouldnt", "yes", "florida", "rick"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

And on Nov. 14, we gathered many of our amazing honorees\u2014like Valeisha Butterfield-Jones, Bomani Jones, Symone Sanders, Misha Green, Luvvie Ajayi, Elaine Welteroth and many more\u2014for an epic celebration that included words of inspiration and twerking through the latest trap anthem.\n\nBecause who says you can't have both?\n\nYes, this night was peak blackness, and I'd be remiss if I didn't point out those melanin-rich moments. Here are the blackest things that happened at The Root 100 2016 gala:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root tapped (see what I did there?) Apt 33, a tap dance collective, which includes the beautiful Maude Arnold, known as one of the tappers from the Syncopated Ladies, to kick off the show with an incredible performance of \"Glory\" by John Legend and Common. The legendary tap dancer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson was the first black vaudeville dancer to perform onstage sans blackface, and it's his position as a pioneer that led the Apt 33 dancers to tap. Tap has strong roots in African culture, and it's amazing to see that this style of dance is timeless.\n\n\n\nThe Root\u2019s publisher, Donna Byrd, gave a fantastic and inspiring speech that focused first on honoring the late Gwen Ifill, the veteran journalist and star in black news who had died earlier that day. Byrd then noted the rough week that we've all trudged through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For those of you who have dusted off your passports, you're not alone. For those of you who've had Kendrick Lamar's 'Alright' on repeat, you, too, are not alone,\" Byrd said.\n\nBlack folks all over America have been considering leaving the country in light of Donald Trump's election as president, and the racist acts that have followed the win have led us all to believe that things are not \"Alright.\" Byrd's encouraging words were the best and blackest way to usher in the awards ceremony.\n\n\"The Root was born for this moment,\" Byrd said of the trying times in a post-Obama America, \"and we are ready.\"\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAjayi took the stage pointing out that part of her wanted to do the speech she had prepared, but another part of her wanted to make fun of white people, specifically white women\u2014who showed up in great numbers at the polls in support of Trump.\n\n\"This last week has been awful, at the direct fault of white women. We're used to getting blamed for a lot of things that happen in the world,\" Ajayi said of the election that came out in Trump's favor. She then went on to say that she was able to get some relief in blaming white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"History has protected white women. White men always get the blame, but we haven't talked about the past's aggression in white women,\" she said.\n\n\n\nOK, so maybe I am a little biased because she's my fabulous boss lady and I helped pick out the skirt, but nothing says black pride like wearing Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Both, Yes, Both Times DJ Jon Blak Played \u201cKnuck if You Buck\u201d\n\nThe Root 100 is more than a ceremony that honors incredible black people who contribute to the world. It's also a party. After dinner, the guests were escorted downstairs for dancing. DJ Jon Blak was spinning tracks like \"Formation\" and \"The Wobble,\" and the floor was packed with activists, educators, politicians and more.\n\nEarly in his set, DJ Jon Blak played Crime Mob's classic \"Knuck if you Buck,\" and everyone and their mamas lost it (and continued to lose it) all over the dance floor. About half an hour later, the DJ was playing the song again. You'd think the crowd would have stopped dancing to shoot him their best \"We already heard that\" look, but as soon as Diamond's \"Yo we knuckin' and buckin' and ready to fight\" played out, the whole room jumped with excitement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders and current CNN commentator brought nothing but bustling energy and blackness to the stage.\n\n\"Black people are so resilient,\" she stated. \"It is young people who monumentally changed the course of American politics over the last year and is extremely important that we remember to keep it truth to power.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid I mention that she's only 26 years old?\n\nThe entire room felt powerful after her words. In fact, Anthony Hamilton or John Legend should have been humming throughout the whole speech.\n\n\"I'm encouraged because we stand on the shoulders of people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Shirley Chisholm \u2026 ,\" Sanders exclaimed to a roaring room. She challenged everyone in the room to be a doer and trailblazer because \"now is the time!\"\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The Root\u2019s Michael Arceneaux's Sweet Potato Pie Twerk\n\nMichael Arceneaux is one of The Root\u2019s strongest voices. He's always a truth teller who brings laughs in every line he writes. Arceneaux's writing absolutely shows up in his offline personality. During the reception, with a plate of sweet potato pie in hand, Arceneaux dropped it down to the floor while Beyonc\u00e9 sang about putting her hands up and spinning. Luvvie Ajayi and I, along with many other attendees, \"yassss'ed\" until we could yasss no more.

Nevertheless, I am going to talk to you even though I fear you vacated your body a long time ago. I believe you sent yourself away where no one could touch you. You went crazy first and now you exist in parts. You, dear Ben, are a man who once was. But being a woman of hope, I ask: can you walk a ways and see where your heart is? I imagine it used to beat with such vigor and passion, a magic heart.\n\nI believe you are dying a slow death in the shell of your skin, because what else could bring you to say enslaved human beings who were stacked atop each other with no room to move or breathe or relieve themselves, who were starved and whipped and raped, who were ripped from their husbands and wives and from their children\u2014many of whom died during the treacherous journey, their bones their only song now at the bottom of dead seas made holy now by their gleam\u2014were immigrants? They were enslaved, Ben. They were worked, often, to death, for nothing. That\u2019s call slavery, Ben. It went on for four centuries. Ben, did you know they were in chains? Ben, what immigrants be in chains? Ben, you sound so stupid, but unfortunately, you are not merely stupid. If you were merely stupid, this would not cause us such outrage. Ben, we knew a while ago that you had become\u2026different. Conservative. Ignorant. Bigoted. You didn\u2019t look or talk like the Ben who was once ours\u2014the way the Temptations are ours, the way Barack and Michelle are ours, the way Anita Baker is ours, the way Maxine Waters is ours, the way gospel and the blues are ours. But we weren\u2019t enough for you. Our love wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and neither was self-love. Even the best Uncle Toms can be said to have been bought. Oh, Ben. I do not believe anyone bought your soul; I believe you just gave it away. And you can\u2019t stand yourself no more. I might\u2019ve felt bad enough to weep for you, except you chose this.\n\nI don\u2019t know where your hands have been, even though I know what they used to be: beautiful, brilliant hands, soft as an angel\u2019s wing, doing God\u2019s mighty work. Ben, you think you doing God\u2019s work now? You ain\u2019t. No one loves you enough to tell you because everyone in your circle is still clinging to the Ben Carson you used to be in hopes that, maybe, you could return. But I sense no one is holding their breath on that. Your new, white friends must love all that you have become: a lonesome shell that is either silent or, when he speaks, deadly.\n\nThough I believe you are gone, gone, gone, I got to at least tell you about yourself. Ben, how many Black boys and girls wanted to be doctors and surgeons because of you? But look what you did yesterday: you made racist white people\u2014and even non-racist white people\u2014get off for slavery. Yeah, you did that. I know it can\u2019t sting you just right because you deadened yourself a while back. Nevertheless. You made them believe we wanted that torture and terror. Ben, do you realize you made them believe it was okay to steal us from our first homes? That somehow, slavery was part of our striving? Ben, do you know you told them we wanted that? That we believe it was all worth it for the American Dream, which for many of us, remains a trick? Ben, your hands dirty. They ain\u2019t just dirty, though, Ben. Your hands bloody. Your hands bloody with Black blood. You put bodies on those ships yesterday. You put chains on little children. You said \u201cimmigrants\u201d as if we chose. As if that could even be possible. If you were only stupid, Ben. But no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you have chosen to be comatose because they were jealous and couldn\u2019t take your Black genius, how you understood the brain\u2014back then\u2014 the way Morrison understands language or the way Miles knew his horn. Ben, you are probably struggling with whom I mean when I say they. I mean white people. I see you shaking your head at that Ben, but they were lesser than you because they couldn\u2019t stand all the genius you were. They hated the way your mind outmaneuvered theirs. Oh, Ben. I can only imagine the landmines of micro and macro aggressions you withstood, on the regular. You were a beautiful brown tree, and they were a hurricane. A fist formed to pound you. I can only imagine the word \u201cnigger\u201d on repeat and all the countless, creative ways they called you that, day in and day out. After all, their greatest creativity is their brutality. The more creative your genius became, the more they reviled you. The more rootless you felt. You let it sink into the bone, how much they hated you. You let them wear you out. Their whiteness haunted you. Their whiteness said you ain\u2019t shit, and you believed them because you wanted their love.\n\nWhy was our love not enough? Did we not hold you up? Did we not whisper your name at Sunday dinners? Did we not pray for God to keep working through your hands? Did we not know your name like we know Dr. King\u2019s? Oh, Ben. Our love is the best love, baby. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t know that when it mattered, back when your soul was in its place, back when your heart beat on time. Your hands used to do magic work. Oh, Lord, your beautiful hands! Now they don\u2019t have no witness to speak of. They just fold in your lap. I can almost hear them: Well, Lord. We tried.\n\nBen\u2026what happened to Ben Carson?\n\nI know he gone. But do you know where you put him? Did you drown him where they drowned Emmett? Was he shot in his driveway like Medgar? Was he bombed on Christmas Eve? Did you lock him in a cell and throw away the key? Did you cut out his tongue when you took away his heart and his soul? Can you count the lives you touched? Then broke? Does Ben know that number?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t even dream anymore.\n\nBen, I have always believed Baby Suggs, holy, of Morrison\u2019s Beloved when she said, \u201cThere is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks. They don\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d Then she died. I thought that was the end-all. But you have bested even her. There ain\u2019t no bad luck in the world, I offer as revision, but a Black man who hates himself. Because that man can do no good. All he can do is make the folks who once loved him wonder if it was a phantom all that time. You made the descendants of the so-called masters feel like they were doing us a favor. Four hundred years of \u201cgood looking out.\u201d Oh, Ben. How you disappoint.\n\nYou need to know you should stop talking. I believe silence is golden right now while you go out there and find your real tongue\u2014the tongue that used to raise people from what would have been a certain death without first your tongue declaring what you were about to do, then your hands doing that magic on operating tables. Lord, how you used to shine in that operating room. How you used to shine everywhere. Don\u2019t you miss your shine? Do you remember how it felt to glow? Naw. I don\u2019t imagine you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen, I can\u2019t stand you no more or the sound of your voice. I remember who you were, though. Part of why we\u2019re out here dragging you for life is not just because you deserve it, but because your mouth is an open wound, and you hurt us with your lies yesterday. We bear the memory of what you used to mean to us. Once, I would have loved to introduce my son to you. That time has passed. I\u2019d believe you might have a chance to come back if it wasn\u2019t for your eyes. They are such lifeless, dead things.\n\nYou still got breath, from what it looks like. You have to have breath to be talking, even though you should stop. Can you use your breath as a starting point? I\u2019d hoped you might\u2019ve left your soul someplace where you can go back for it. But yesterday, you snatched pretty much all hope of that. Still and all. I write to you. Maybe something inside of you is still alive. You owe us an apology, you sad, sad shell of what used to be a man worthy of our esteem, our respect, our devotion, and our love. Now, all we got for you is shade. And scorch. Even if you uttered sorry, all we would hear is lifeless noise. So. Keep it.\n\nBut this:\n\nBen, put your eyes back in. See what you did to yourself. Amidst a sea of brown love that washed over you, back then, as a prayer, you waded out into deep water and went under. Now you work for a spoiled, hateful, incompetent soul. You salute to him. Those splinters in your feet are from the pedestal we put you on, that you shattered. Oh. How you bleed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI leave you, bewildered but not surprised.\n\nTameka Cage Conley, PhD is a literary artist who writes poetry, fiction, plays, and essays.

Let Facebook tell it, it's the best, Blackest album that's been released in quite some time. I'm not sure I'm in that camp, though I can understand why folks love it so much. But I don't think it's nearly as good or as Black as Facebook keeps telling me. I do love \"Cranes In The Sky\" though. I mean, I try to drink lots of things away. They never go away though. I'm not sure who \"they\" is but they do not mean me well. Before we get into the details and minutiae and shit, do tell, how do you feel about A Seat At The Table, as a whole?\n\nShamira: Well, Peej, I love the album like a fat kid loves cake. Or really, like I love cake. Because who doesn't love cake? Well, my waistline don't love cake, but I digress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think I've listened to at the very least a portion of the album every day since the album dropped. At work, on the train, at home. It hasn't gotten old yet. I wouldn't say that the album is unskippable per second, but I don't have a part that I actively dislike - which is astounding, considering that Solange solicited a verse from Lil is-he-or-isnt-he-retired Wayne. And it wasn't half bad!\n\nThe standouts for me are definitely in the front half of the album. \"Rise\" is a great opening track, \"Weary\" is solid, and \"Cranes in the Sky\" hit me like a punch in the gut because it basically detailed the 2nd half of 2014 for me. I am very glad to be away from that dark and shadowy place.\n\nWith regards to the alleged Blackness\u2026I'm gonna admit I'm getting tired of the concept of \"unapologetic\" Blackness. Anything with Black content creators that caters to a Black audience via their personal experience is going be Black, period. Like sure, the album is Black as fuck, whatever that means at this point\u2026but so is the upcoming smash hit Boo! A Madea Halloween! I feel like this arbitrary label is being used to put certain content on some sort of communal pedestal that's supposed to represent the \"best\" of us, but it becomes trite because people, places, and things will inevitably fall short one way or another. See: Newton, Cam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that the album feels both personal and relatable matters more to me than the fact that the album reminded me that I need to put tea tree oil in my box braids. But jokey jokes aside, I fucks with this album the long way - and this is a person that has gone on record previously as saying that Solange's best song was the Proud Family theme.\n\nNot sure, but I think your \"they\" is the same \"they\" who is allegedly conspiring to keep Birth of A Nation down.\n\nPanama: At this point, the only thing that I can think of when it comes to Birth of A Nation is this: life comes at you fast. Not even a year ago, Nate Parker was on top of the world\u2026well, it's a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to Solange. I really want to like this album because social media keeps telling me its a good album. And it's not a bad album, but I keep waiting for somebody to send me the version they have because the versions I've heard on Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music - which are all the same - are fairly snoozeworthy. \"Cranes In The Sky\" is an awesome song. I sing that song here or there. I sing that song almost everywhere. But the rest of the album does absolutely nothing for me. Not even \"F.U.B.U.\", you know the song she sings about a song about singing about a song about Black people. It's one of those pointless songs that folks are acting like is revolutionary. Thing is, it might be if she had any white fans who would come to her shows and NOT be able to sing \"for all my niggas in the whole wide world\u2026\". But she doesn't.\n\nBut because I'm a scholar and a gentleman, I have continued to listen, daily, to this album. El Debarge likes it. Grand Puba likes it. Enrique Iglesias likes it. I keep it on repeat hoping that something sonically changes that makes me say, \"oooooooooooh shit!\" But mostly I just want to vacuum when it's on because it's awesome vacuum music. Or even awesome elevator music. I definitely don't think it's some ultra Black album either. I just don't hear it that way. I appreciate the interludes where her mama and daddy and Master P speak on their experiences, but at not one point did I involuntarily raise my Black fist. And I've heard songs that made my head nod because my neck knew it was phat and if J. Cole can go platinum with no features, I know that anything is possible.\n\nI will say that I'm glad Solange is getting all this love, though. There really is nothing negative to say about her. She seems fun and awesome and is doing it her way and she DJs and brings Jay and 'Yonce to parties in NYC. She's the fun Knowles. And just because I don't think its a dope album doesn't mean it isn't. Apparently it's moving tons of people and she had the #1 album in the country this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I have seen is several (I won't exaggerate and say enough people to engender an entire article) people suggest that this album is better than Lemonade and unnecessarily draw a Beyonce comparison. Again, unnecessary. But since we're here, I think those people are smoking all the crack. And the Sherm. Any merits to that claim for you and those dreaming eyes of yours?\n\nShamira: Your feelings on Solange are basically my feelings on Chance the Rapper's music. He seems to be a really dope, really earnest personal over all, just a bucket of fun and hugs and good nature, but Coloring Book has like\u20263 and a possible enjoyable songs to me. At first I thought it was because I didn't grow up in the Black Church (TM) , but I'll bussit to some Kirk Franklin and Mary Mary. I just hate his nasally rap-singing voice he insists on using, almost as much as Big Seans. I hate neither as much as E-40s though. As a friend once said, E-40 raps like Jell-O is falling out his mouth.\n\nYou really don't like \"F.U.B.U\"? I don't think we're gonna hear people chanting it at rallies or anything, but me, myself, personally, I've made it a personal objective to roll up at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in DC, find an elevated surface, and proudly bleat \"All My Niggas In The Whole Wide World\" with my arms extended . Considering how tickers to the NMAAHC are apparently going faster than the spicy dark meat at your local Popeye's establishment , this dream may not be fulfilled until 2019 - but still I rise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get the inclination to compare this album to her sister's, even if I find it misguided. For one, both albums seem to be the closest we have ever gotten to a truly personal look into their lives and experiences, down to their parentals and the influence it had on their Negro nose and Jackson Five nostrils. I'd even go so far as to say that the sisters are informed by each other to a certain capacity. But that's pretty much where it ends. What Beyonc\u00e9 did is on a whole other scale of accomplishment, as a complete project that captured so many aspects of Black womanhood in a truly unprecedented way. It's unfair to pit the two against each other. Solange's album stands strong on its own merits - and for what it's worth, I think the songwriting on little sis's album is stronger.\n\nSpeaking of \"Cranes in the Sky\", how many ways did you X something away that Sol ain't get too? Off the top of the dome: I ate it away, I smoked it away, I subtweeted it away, I stair mastered it away only to follow it with chickening it away\u2026.I think I got some solid bars for the remix.\n\nAlso, what are these magical 20 extra states in the US of A that the Knowles family has access to? Because last I checked there were only 50 states to travel to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPanama: I definitely did all those things away. The I also crackpiped it away, but my mother and my parole officer agreed to never speak about that again. Also, about Chance, you're smoking. I think Chance is one of the most brilliant artists out right now. At the same time, I COMPLETELY understand hating his voice. I like it (again with El DeBarge), but I cannot fault anybody for hating his music because they can't stand the sound of his voice.\n\nI think if you went up to the NMAAHC, even in 2019, and started singing those lines, a 65-year-old Black woman would slap the taste out of your mouth for disrespecting your elders with such filthflarnfilthy language. Nat Turner 'nem died for this museum to exist and you niggas coming up in her talking about niggas.\n\nNiggas. Not for nothing, I've been twice and have tickets for another weekend in October, January, February, and March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm glad you brought up how many states Solange has claimed to have visited in order to ____ it away. No lie, I actually talked myself into thinking that maybe she's including states in other countries because she really wanted to use the term \"states\". For instance, if she's been to Frankfurt, Germany, then she's been to the state of Essen. I realize it's a reach, but so is saying the songwriting on A Seat At The Table is stronger. Neither is particularly dope, but I'm going to go ahead and say that \"Sorry, I'm not sorry\" is the greatest 4 word combination of words in music history, only followed by \"suck on my balls, pause\" especially because there was no reason to pause that statement. Literary brilliance.\n\nLast question and we can wrap this up, what kind of staying power do you think this will have? Is this an album you think we'll be listening to a year from now or was it a wrinkle in time?\n\nShamira: My baby brother just went to visit the NMAAHC as a college trip and spent the entire day sending me snaps of him dabbing next to statues of historic Black folks. I feel like I should be allowed to drop a lyrical N-bomb for the culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen is the Negro community going to come up with a nickname for the NMAAHC that rolls off the tongue better? I understand that the Nigga Museum won't curl all the way over for the aforementioned senior citizens, but we gotta figure something out. My ESL self keeps tripping over all the damn letters.\n\nBetter and/or more memorable one liners does not a better song make, PJ. By that metric Weezy is one of the most prolific songwriters in history. (I know someone is going to try to defend this statement. Don't. The nigga been rapping about being an alien for the last decade.).\n\nThe test of time assessment is really hard for me to gauge - but at best guess now, I don't think it'll be in regular rotation until the end of days (largely because I don't have the emotional bandwidth to sit forlornly in a bathtub while trying to identify those 20 surplus states), but when it comes up on shuffle, I'll gladly give the whole album a run. It's basically the Get Lifted treatment, except I won't be sad that he has basically devolved into Michael Bubl\u00e9 for Niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*sighs* I miss the old John Legend. The crooning fuckboy John Legend. The barely faithful John Legend. Brutally honest John Legend.\n\n*goes off to count the states in Germany*\n\nPanama: Few things:\n\n1. I've seen friends of mine on Facebook refer to it as the #Blacksonian. I'm not completely sure who said it first, but they are brilliant.\n\n2. Lil Wayne is absolutely one of the most prolific songwriters in history. Period. To deny that is to deny yourself. Know the ledge. Hate him or love him, the man has done the work.\n\n3. I can't imagine that I'll be listening to this album past the writing of this piece, save for \"Cranes In The Sky\" which deserves some year end consideration on every list.\n\n4.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["teacher", "probably", "student", "day", "suggestions", "going", "policy", "students", "shit", "arming", "teachers", "worst", "class", "school", "chris"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country,\u201d says the proud gay midfielder, who adds, \u201cIt's important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["survivors", "fla", "far", "right", "used", "aide", "school", "students", "shooting", "douglas", "parkland", "reform", "stoneman", "state", "seeking", "gun", "theories"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["guns", "right", "nra", "stop", "money", "nras", "members", "war", "ownership", "wont", "white", "buy", "black", "control", "theres", "kids", "gun", "believe", "theory"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["legal", "right", "nra", "dont", "nras", "terrorist", "deaths", "second", "directly", "organization", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

One weapon Putin described as a \u201clow-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile ... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defense and air defense,\u201d the BBC reports.\n\nIn true Putin fashion, he didn\u2019t actually show the weapons, which all sound like the nuclear equivalent of a shark carrying an alligator on its back. According to Putin, who lies about as much as the current U.S. president, Russia has crafted undetectable weapons that can do all kinds of amazing destruction, and America better pay attention!\n\nHere\u2019s how Business Insider described the Russian unveiling of mass destruction:\n\nA computer-generated animation accompanied each weapon announcement, perhaps illustrating that they exist mainly in a conceptual state. First, Putin mentioned a new intercontinental ballistic, which he claimed had unlimited range and could get past all US missile defenses. An animation showed the missile taking two trajectories toward the West. Without showing much real video of the product, Putin said \u201cour defense companies have launched mass production of this new system.\u201d Next, Putin announced what he called a \u201cglobal cruise missile,\u201d which he claimed had unlimited range and was nuclear-propelled. An animation showed the missile fired from Russia\u2019s north, flying north of Europe into the Atlantic, weaving through US air-defense zones, and then inexplicably traveling south the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean before wrapping around Argentina and ending up near Chile. Then, Putin seemed to confirm a long-feared \u201cdoomsday\u201d weapon: an unmanned, undersea vehicle capable of carrying a nuclear weapon across oceans at high speeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it may have only been computer-generated destruction of the West, it proves that Russia is not our friend, so it may be time for President Donald Trump to stop emailing Putin about which workout classes he\u2019s taking and how he makes his three-bean chili dip, and start treating Russia like the threat it has always been.\n\n\u201cThey kept ignoring us,\u201d Putin said of the West, to a standing ovation, Business Insider reports. \u201cNobody wanted to listen to us, so listen to us now.\u201d", "keywords": ["claimed", "russia", "come", "cant", "weapon", "trump", "vladimir", "intercepted", "claims", "president", "west", "weapons", "nuclear", "defense", "putin", "missile"], "polarity": 0.1048030303030303, "subjectivity": 0.40401010101010104},

But the news cycle that seems to find Russia under every rock has become too repetitive and overwhelming for me to bear any longer.\n\nWithout question, it\u2019s clear that Moscow tried to exploit Americans\u2019 political views through social media during the 2016 presidential election. Not only have America\u2019s intelligence communities determined as much, but the heads of the social media platforms that Russian-backed entities exploited concur. Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014be it his former national security adviser Mike Flynn or ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2014have ties to Moscow that point to possible collusion.\n\nJulia Ioffe of The Atlantic recently reported that Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks via private messages on Twitter concerning damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Hope Hicks may have tried to hide emails concerning a mysterious meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians tied to the Kremlin. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News that the Russian government breached U.S. voting systems.\n\nThese stories are revealing but are few and far between. When we aren\u2019t hearing groundbreaking news on the Russian investigation, which is not common, we\u2019re inundated with talking heads discussing how shady Trump and his cronies are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYawn. We know already.\n\nMy problem with the news cycle is that it is ignoring white America\u2019s complicity in the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the first place. If Russian bots can undo in one election cycle what it took centuries to build, does America have a democracy at all? And if we are to believe that disinformation campaigns turned the outcome for Trump (there is no evidence of that), why didn\u2019t most voters of color cast ballots for him?\n\nA lack of a self-reflective discourse in mainstream media\u2019s coverage essentially scapegoats Russia for the debacle that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. It\u2019s one thing to cover the Russia investigation. It\u2019s another to ignore or downplay why white people voted for a man who refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, even when America\u2019s top intelligence agencies confirmed Putin\u2019s role in attempting to undermine the U.S. political process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia coverage devoid of this angle ignores the social chasms that compel white people to choose their race over allegiance to their country. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s challenging for me to watch and read news of Russia\u2019s threat to democracy when America is doing a great job of destroying it all by itself.\n\n\n\nMy cynicism is rooted in the knowledge of America\u2019s barbaric resolve to strip black people of their rights to fully experience the democracy that, coincidentally, did not come under attack until Russia unleashed a legion of Twitter trolls.\n\n\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t afford me the luxury of binary analysis. I can\u2019t just look at the Kremlin\u2019s threats against America without recognizing the internal threats that Moscow actively attempted to exploit\u2014threats that have a personal impact on my life as a black person. I don\u2019t enjoy the full spectrum of citizenship; nor does the rest of black America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve endured more than 200 years of slavery, decades of Jim Crow, mob violence and voter suppression. These horrendous periods still haunt America. The Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voter Rights Act in 2013. GOP-led state legislatures actively passed voter-ID laws that make voting harder. America\u2019s police state kills black people at disproportionate rates, and governments at the federal and state levels are actively undermining health care access.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t flow with the \u201cRussia is attacking our democracy\u201d angle because America is doing a better job of it. Of course, we can admit that Russian meddling isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019d be more inclined to engage media that explores Americans\u2019 complicity in it. I know what\u2019s wrong with this country, and it isn\u2019t Russia. It\u2019s racist white Trump supporters. If they had followed the conscience of people of color (especially black women), American democracy wouldn\u2019t be under the threat it\u2019s currently in.\n\nTo see countless white men (former ambassadors, think tank types, legislators and the running chorus of talking heads) appear on network television extolling the virtues of America\u2019s so-called democracy that Russia wants to undermine annoys me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs journalists, it is our job to report the facts. That racism both fueled Trump\u2019s victory and has consequently made us more susceptible to foreign attack only makes the stakes of the Russia investigation even higher. But major networks and print outlets will not lead with stories exploring white America\u2019s obsession with racism. That would upset too many advertisers\u2014and white viewers. But it would be the beginning of the type of intersectional Russia coverage that could help an audience better understand Russia and America\u2019s imperial aims and how election meddling plays a role in it.\n\nAs soon as Trump is arrested or forced to resign, I fear interest in Russia will fade, and that would be a pity. There has rarely been a better time than now to learn about the complexities of Russian imperialism and the lessons it can teach us about America\u2019s shortcomings at home and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth nations actively vie for world supremacy through a range of tactics, including political interference in some cases and through military force in others. Our media can play a vital role of explaining U.S.-Russia relations within this context. Such deep dives require media outlets and the white men who run them to understand how white supremacy and empire work.\n\n\n\nAnother problem with our media\u2019s fixation on Russia-gate is that other important news stories are getting little to no attention. Trump is belligerently calling for a nuclear arms race. As late as the mid-1980s, there were some 75,000 nuclear weapons in the world, mostly between Russia and the United States. Calm-headed diplomacy between Moscow and Washington, D.C., over the decades cut that figure down to around 15,000.\n\nThe new Nuclear Posture Review clearly shows that America isn\u2019t interested in cutting anymore nukes; nor is Trump interested in using his alleged good relationship with Putin to convince the Russian leader to reverse his own lust for nukes. All eyes are on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but Trump\u2019s love for nuclear weapons may very well convince Russia that there is no need to scale back its arsenal, making the world a less safe place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while politics between Russia and America on Earth are frayed, their relationship in space is strong. Roscosmos, Russia\u2019s space agency, and NASA announced the Deep Space Getaway program last year, part of a larger project to send humans to the moon. It is one of the few areas in which both nations must get along. Exploring why Moscow and Washington are cooperating in space would reveal that the two nations aren\u2019t always at odds and that they do need each other.\n\nAnd as much as the media love to cover Putin as an authoritarian the Russian people foolishly support, it is important to consider that most of white America supported Trump, who seemingly envies his Russian counterpart\u2019s anti-democratic ways. Indeed, Putin and Trump supporters may have a lot in common.\n\nSimply viewing Russia as an attacker of American values without investigating how Americans are destroying them in far worse ways isn\u2019t good Russia reporting. It simply blames Russia for Trump. That is insulting to the Russian people and Americans who know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil mainstream newsrooms make proper paradigm shifts in how they report the complexities of why Russia is doing what it is doing and why Americans are susceptible to it, we\u2019ll continue to suffer through one-sided reporting that indirectly weakens the democracy that American media strive to defend.\n\n", "keywords": ["america", "americas", "moscow", "russian", "russia", "media", "trump", "white", "democracy", "boring", "nuclear"], "polarity": 0.06519909237300542, "subjectivity": 0.3877371018675368},

His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["republican", "weak", "look", "ukraine", "russian", "russia", "fake", "trump", "hawks", "obama", "president", "trumps", "making", "gop", "russias"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

Should Americans truly be perplexed by Trump\u2019s praise of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has used his national police force to target drug dealers and users in a campaign that has left an estimated 13,000 people dead?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot really.\n\nBefore winning the presidency, Trump never had to answer to anyone except for his father, whom he worked for before taking over the family business after his death. Being the singular decision-maker in a high-profile real estate company for more than 30 years certainly leaves little patience for concessions to and caucusing with colleagues who are required to be treated as equals.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent complaint that he wishes he could have more influence on the Justice Department further reveals his disdain for the limitations of power. Consequently, his love of strongmen around the world who can rule with abandon makes sense. While he has complimented many strongmen around the world, three stand out the most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Supports police brutality, uses crude language, has no filter.\n\nAnalysis: Like Trump, Duterte encourages police brutality, but the Philippines leader takes it to an extreme. Trump has gone on record telling police officers to rough up people taken into custody and has considered sending the feds to Chicago, which essentially would make them an occupying force that does nothing to reduce crime. Back in the mid-1980s, he ran ads in major New York City papers calling for five black men to be executed after they were wrongly arrested for raping a white woman in Central Park. Of course, racism was a driving force behind all of this, but it also fuels his desire to use over-the-top government policing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother quality Trump shares with Duterte is his lack of a filter. Duterte once compared himself to Hitler. He later apologized. In October of last year, Duterte told then-President Barack Obama to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d just as the United States and the Philippines began joint military exercises. The following month, Duterte called Obama a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d Of course, since Russia and China are closer geographically, it would make sense for the Philippines to forge strong ties with them, but the United States and the Philippines share a defense treaty that states they would protect each other if attacked by an external force.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a smart idea to piss off the world\u2019s most powerful military that could protect you when the time calls for it. But Duterte isn\u2019t one to think through things. Neither is his buddy Trump.\n\nBut Trump apparently likes Duterte\u2019s ability to do and say as he pleases. Duterte is not a dictator per se, and he enjoys widespread support, despite his abuse of police power. Trump probably wishes he could abuse his powers and have widespread support, too, but U.S. rule of law would not allow it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess Trump has to admire those who can.\n\nVladimir Putin, President of Russia\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Authoritarian, leads a kleptocracy, answers to no one.\n\nAnalysis: The obvious reason for this is probably the fact that the U.S. intelligence community believes that the Kremlin worked to get Trump elected. Not to mention Russia\u2019s alleged ties to WikiLeaks, which, according to a recent report in The Atlantic, was in contact with Donald Trump Jr. But there are personality reasons why Trump would find Vladimir Putin to be an aspirational leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor one, Russia is a kleptocracy. That\u2019s a fancy political science term that means those in power use the state primarily to steal resources from the state. Or, more directly, rule by thieves. Putin\u2019s estimated net worth is in the billions of dollars. PBS\u2019s Frontline aired a documentary in which Putin is accused of using his political position in the early 1990s to steal land from the Russian state and sell it for personal gain.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House very much functions as a kleptocracy. He has openly acknowledged that his resorts and golf courses have generated tens of millions of dollars since he took office in January. His properties Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, and Bedminster, in New Jersey, have gotten free advertising during his estimated 58 visits so far as president. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser who takes on major foreign policy roles, even though he has no foreign policy experience. In her role as White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway once promoted Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing on live television in what some considered a violation of federal ethics rules. Ivanka also received lucrative Chinese patents the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. The list goes on and on.\n\nAnother reason Trump may find Putin appealing is his suppression of freedom of expression. Artists, film directors and journalists have all felt the strain (and, in some cases, been killed) under Putin\u2019s restrictive regime. Trump cannot control media here and has long referred to the press as \u201cfake news\u201d because of its fair reporting of his administration. In October he even threatened to challenge media organizations\u2019 licenses. He really can\u2019t do that, but Trump\u2019s desire to do so is the stuff of authoritarian states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump wants to be a strongman, but because the United States is a functioning democracy, he can\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from adoring men like Putin who can be.\n\nKim Jong Un, Leader of North Korea\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Unpredictable, runs a totalitarian state.\n\nAnalysis: Given that Kim Jong Un has consistently vowed to wipe the United States off the map, it really doesn\u2019t make sense for Trump to find the North Korean leader likable. But this is Trump, and nothing makes sense in his world. Back in May, he complimented Kim for, apparently, taking out his adversaries to assume power of Pyongyang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people, I\u2019m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he was able to do it. So obviously, he\u2019s a pretty smart cookie.\u201d\n\nDuring a campaign rally last early year, Trump made similar remarks, according to ABC News:\n\n\u201cHow many young guys\u2014he was like 26 or 25 when his father died\u2014take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden ... he goes in, he takes over, and he\u2019s the boss,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn\u2019t play games. And we can\u2019t play games with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Trump has called Kim \u201cRocket Man\u201d and the North Korean leader has returned the insults. But Trump\u2019s complimentary remarks toward Kim do reflect the president\u2019s perverted understanding of strength. North Korea is a totalitarian state, meaning that the people are completely submissive to the rule of the dictator and the state. This is actually worse than either Putin\u2019s Russia or Duterte\u2019s Philippines because at least people in those nations can protest, albeit with limitations, in the case of Russia.\n\nBut perhaps Kim\u2019s appeal to Trump has to do with the North Korean people\u2019s worship of their leader. Official events in the country often show people expressing such adulation for Kim and its past leaders that they are left in tears. While many analysts argue that these celebrations are forced, one could say that Trump\u2019s own healthy ego yearns for such attention\u2014even if it is not sincere.\n\nHere in the United States, Trump gets nothing like the public support that Kim, Putin and Duterte receive in their own nations. None of those nations, though, are model democracies, and all lack certain degrees of the rule of law. What is troubling is Trump\u2019s desire to erode the rule of law in his own country. Whether it\u2019s his frustration over not being able to unleash the Justice Department on Hillary Clinton or how the media operates, Trump has no real appreciation for democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes sense, though. He doesn\u2019t truly believe in it anyway. And neither do his buddies in Russia, North Korea and the Philippines.\n\n", "keywords": ["duterte", "north", "love", "kim", "donald", "guide", "philippines", "trump", "trumps", "strongmen", "states", "rule", "president", "putin"], "polarity": 0.08955911372578039, "subjectivity": 0.4314021472354806},

It\u2019s pretty basic: If you\u2019re willing to throw your people under the bus in order to promote your selfish ambitions and cuddle up with the (white) man, you\u2019re a sellout.\n\nWhile I have strived to divorce myself from using such language for the sake of productive dialogue, I cannot help exploring the cases of Donald Trump and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, both of whom sold out their respective countries for closer proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe main link between these two sellouts: Paul Manafort.\n\nIt makes sense that Manafort, who spent 10 years in Ukraine advising Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions, would eventually take the helm of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. To be sure, Yanukovych is very much like Trump. His only interests in Ukraine were to get rich and maintain power, according to John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2004 to 2006. Likewise, Trump cares little about policy and more about ratcheting up racial anxiety among his base to maintain his hold on the Oval Office\u2014not to mention he\u2019s also using it as a cash cow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYanukovych, who was convicted of robbery and assault as a younger man, was widely considered a corrupt politician as an adult, and his Party of Regions has long been believed to have Mafia ties. Manafort cleaned up Yanukovych\u2019s image, teaching him how to deliver a speech even though the American spoke no Russian or Ukrainian. Manafort instructed him on how to expand his base beyond the Russian-speaking minorities who backed him in the eastern part of the country. In 2004, Yanukovych ran for president and won, but the election was rife with voter fraud, leading to mass protests and, eventually, a do-over that was won by his pro-Western opponent, Viktor Yushchenko.\n\nThough Yanukovych lost, Manafort earned a role as a top adviser to the Party of Regions and would plot for the next election in 2010, which Yanukovych would eventually win in a very close race. One of the first controversial moves Yanukovych made was to extend the lease of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, set to expire in 2017, to at least 2042. For many Ukrainians who feared Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions for Ukraine, Yanukovych\u2019s move was a clear sign that Kiev would be under Moscow\u2019s thumb for decades to come.\n\nDuring his time in office, Yanukovych would eventually run the country into the ground and steal billions of dollars from its coffers, according to Ukrainian officials. Manafort was allegedly paid more than $28 million for his work over the period he was in Ukraine. For his part, Manafort insists that he wanted to coach the Party of Regions and Yanukovych to become more Westernized and less corrupt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final straw for Ukrainians tired of Yanukovych came in 2013, when he reneged on signing the European Union Association Agreement that many Ukrainians supported at the time and felt would pull the country closer to better economic opportunities in the West. Putin was against the deal and threatened Yanukovych politically if he went through with it.\n\nYanukovych caved, and again, in less than 10 years, people stormed the streets, this time calling for Yanukovych\u2019s resignation. He responded by allegedly ordering the nation\u2019s security services to fire into crowds of protesters, killing dozens of them. Snipers were even used to terrorize protesters, Ukrainian officials allege. And, to add insult to injury, Yanukovych called on Russia to use force to put down his own people\u2019s protests because he lacked the leadership to look them in the eye after falling out of their favor.\n\nIf calling on another nation\u2019s military to suppress protests in your own country isn\u2019t a sellout move, I really do not know what is. Yanukovych eventually fled and is in hiding in Russia under the care of Putin, who would eventually annex Crimea, a region in east Ukraine, and back rebels in eastern Ukraine who are waging war against Kiev. Yep, Yanukovych is chillin\u2019 in Russia with folks who do not really want Ukraine to be its own nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, folks, was the man Manafort backed for 10 years. A pure sellout to his people and his country.\n\nSo when Manafort left Ukraine in 2014, it would make sense for him to eventually see an opportunity in backing Trump, a man who is as much a sellout as Yanukovych. We didn\u2019t know in the beginning of Trump\u2019s campaign, but his top aides were allegedly forming very suspect alliances with Russians who reportedly have ties to the Kremlin. Carter Page, Mike Flynn, Manafort himself and others would eventually have to leave the Trump campaign because of those suspicious ties.\n\nTrump, curiously, has yet to say anything negative about Putin despite criticizing former President Barack Obama for allowing Russia to invade Ukraine. Trump said nothing as it became clear that Putin was meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which U.S. intelligence officials believe was done to support Trump. To this day, he has yet to condemn Russia for its actions. To the contrary, he has created a voter-fraud commission that will likely lead to voter suppression of black and brown Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remember, Trump encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, a pure sellout thing to do. Manafort would not stay on to lead Trump to his November victory, but Manafort\u2019s efforts to put a Kremlin puppet in the White House reveal how willing he is to help world leaders sell out their countries for access to Russia.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Robert Mueller is in the thick of his investigation, so we are still learning the details of Manafort\u2019s ties to Russia and any possible ties to the Trump campaign. But one thing is very clear: Manafort is tied to two world leaders who sold out their countries at the expense of risking their sovereignty to an expansionist Kremlin.\n\nThe thing about sellouts is that they are ostracized and shunned by their people. Or at least they should be. Ukrainians did the right thing and revolted against Yanukovych, sending him to Russia, where he belongs. Americans should get Trump and his ilk one-way tickets to Moscow as well. But unlike Ukrainians, many white folks here actually support Trump being a sellout to Putin. So that leaves us to depend on Mueller, who is expected to force Trump\u2019s inner circle to account for what appears to be collusion with Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort was charged with 12 counts on Monday, including conspiracy against the United States, but there was one missing: being the adviser of sellouts.", "keywords": ["adviser", "ukrainians", "ukraine", "paul", "russia", "manafort", "trump", "eventually", "ukrainian", "yanukovych", "sellout", "putin", "sellouts"], "polarity": 0.04486935972891029, "subjectivity": 0.4223961120028535},

Why did anyone ever bother to pretend otherwise?\n\nSo now that everyone is caught up, yes, it means that 45 is a weak leader for what many have rightfully referred to as a \u201cdereliction of duty,\u201d and of course, the cowardly act makes America look even smaller on the world stage.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for their meeting, a live adaptation of Pinocchio, look at the glee in 45\u2019s eyes. He looks ready to climax. For those who were hoping for a public scolding: Bless y\u2019all\u2019s hearts. 45 looked ready to ask Putin, \u201cHow do you like your eggs, zaddy?\u201d in Russian.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-Putin meeting was scheduled to last only 30 minutes but went well over two hours. What did they talk about? Well, it\u2019s unlikely that 45 or Secretary of State Blanche Devereaux\u2019s Ex-Boyfriend will share any real details, even if it\u2019s easy to take notes while on one\u2019s knees. Putin probably played 45 for the narcissistic simpleton he is as the secretary of state tapped his feet waiting for Russian sanctions to be lifted so that Exxon can cash out. That said, the Russian state-run outlet Sputnik reports that Putin and 45 discussed Ukraine, Syria, the fight against terrorism and cybersecurity.\n\nSo the Ukraine is theirs, Syria will be handled however they see fit, the same goes for terrorism and \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018cybersecurity,\u2019 comrade?\u201d\n\n\n\nPutin has helped installed a mindless reality star and longtime scammer as the head of state of his broke-bitch nation\u2019s greatest adversary, but while it is fair to make him the international bogeyman, the reality is, hordes of white folks voted for 45 for no other reason than that they wanted to feel good about being white. It\u2019s called \u201ccultural anxiety,\u201d but that\u2019s merely business-casual dressing for \u201cracism.\u201d These people wanted to feel so good about being white that they elected a fool with no real love of America and its principles. They continue to be excused although their votes have made it abundantly clear that they love this country far less than the very \u201cothers\u201d they believe are wrecking it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo many of us\u2014including the last U.S. president\u2014have been called unpatriotic for far fewer offenses (or none at all). Yet this bloated orange soda can of a man stood among the world\u2019s richest nations and cowered to Russia\u2019s despot, and he still won\u2019t be called out as the traitor that he is. I suppose I could ask why, but that would be as silly a question as wondering all week how 45 would act when he\u2019s made his plans all too clear.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["week", "benefactor", "political", "yalls", "russian", "expected", "hes", "white", "real", "president", "met", "behaved", "state", "45", "meeting", "putin"], "polarity": 0.09964204545454547, "subjectivity": 0.43950347222222225},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying the previously blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was actually described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel.

According to the Google, that\u2019s \u201cbeloved\u201d in Russian.\n\n\n\nThis week, various news reports, including one from NBC News, claimed that a psychological makeup on 45 was being prepped for Russian President Vladmir Putin. According to the preliminary findings, the new American president is \u201ca risk-taker who can be naive,\u201d according to \u201ca senior Kremlin adviser.\u201d Other revelations include that 45 \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand fully who is Mr. Putin\u2014he is a tough guy.\u201d\n\nNo. 45 doesn\u2019t know a lot of things, including the basic functions of the U.S. government; the Constitution; how anyone not white, male, well-off and boosted by nepotism lives; and anything that requires the intellect of someone above a fourth-grade reading level. Oh, and apparently \u201cmany in the Kremlin believed that Trump viewed the presidency as a business.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether this dossier\u2014compiled by retired diplomats and Putin staff members\u2014also tells us the color of the sky.\n\n\n\nIts intent, it is said, is to properly prep Putin for his first meeting with 45. However, considering the growing evidence that 45 is the mutt he helped housebreak into the White House, you would think he would already be quite familiar with a man who literally is inescapable within media. What else is there to learn about an erratic narcissist who\u2019s never shown allegiance to anything besides himself and maybe his daughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not in the habit of assisting comrades, but since I\u2019ve always wanted to play redbone Frasier Crane for a spell, I\u2019d like to help out.\n\n\n\nFor starters, 45 is a dumb-ass man who believes anything that sounds totally implausible but nonetheless complimentary to his dim-witted view of the world. To wit, \u201cthe failing New York Times\u201d recently profiled 45\u2019s favorite little conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. For those among \u201cthe blacks\u201d who are unfamiliar, let me paint a picture: Take the overweight lover Heavy D, remove his melanin and paint his mug with idiocy and lunacy, then marry him off to one of those grocery store tabloids that swear Kourtney Kardashian is having Xenu\u2019s baby. That is Jones, and much like Jones, 45 enjoys being loud, wrong and crazy.\n\n\n\nWe live in a free country until the Colby-Jack F\u00fchrer declares otherwise, but Vladimir, you can\u2019t trust anyone that stupid to do anything for you, no matter how much piss-stained footage you may or may not have on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is Politico\u2019s \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Campaign Staffers Tried to Keep Him Off Twitter,\u201d which deep-dives into how those poor, unfortunate, soulless individuals often tried in vain to keep their then-candidate from live-tweeting the presidential election to often disastrous results.\n\n\n\nFormer Communications Director Sam Nunberg explained:\n\n\n\nIf candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable. The same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support. I would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, Put-Put (if I can call you that, Vlad), if you want to stay on 45\u2019s good side, always retweet him. Hell, favorite his tweets, too. Make him feel special. That should help. Well, temporarily, anyway. He\u2019s going to turn on you anyway. Ask Ivana Trump. Or Marla Maples. Or Melania Trump when her pussy-grabbing husband isn\u2019t hovering over her. Or any contractors still waiting to be paid for their services.\n\n\n\nThen again, no matter what the Kremlin may have on the man, or however much its often shirtless authoritarian compliments him, he is an dishonest, disloyal, messy bitch from Queens, N.Y. I don\u2019t believe in the adage \u201cTrust no bitch,\u201d but Put-Put, don\u2019t trust that bitch. Not to get anything done, anyway\u2014particularly when his approval ratings are lower than the Grammy Awards are with black women, gay black men and people with taste.\n\nIt seems that part of this dossier is rooted in just such growing concern. NBC reports:\n\nPutin\u2019s government is growing increasingly concerned about Trump\u2019s battles in Washington, according to Fedorov and former lawmaker Sergei Markov, who remains well-connected at the Kremlin. It is worried the president will not have the political power to improve relations with Russia, as he has indicated he might try to do, and even, perhaps, lift some U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut-Put is beginning to worry that Honeysuckle Lenin won\u2019t be able to do much in the way of boosting Russia\u2019s raggedy ass on the global stage. That explains why the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is accusing various mainstream media outlets of spreading fake news about Muva Russia.\n\nVia CNN:\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the project was aimed at countering an \u201cinformation campaign aimed against Russia\u201d by exposing false statements from leading foreign media outlets and officials. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Zakharova said stories about Moscow\u2019s attempts to hack foreign elections and Russian submarines operating in northern Europe were examples of such fake news.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Russia\u2019s little intel operation seeking to influence elections in Western elections is starting to backfire. To quote the goddess Rihanna, \u201c#PoorDat.\u201d As a black man, I\u2019m not exactly strolling the streets shouting, \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d Even so, I find it amusing that a hostile foreign government that helped elect an orange, unqualified simpleton as U.S. president is suddenly finding itself a wee bit shaken.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure that Sunkist Stalin and Vladimir Putin will continue their public flirtation for the foreseeable future. Still, ultimately, 45 will fail Putin the way he tends to fail most people.

It was also noted that Flynn may have been in danger of being blackmailed by the Russians, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cI inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,\u201d Flynn wrote in his resignation letter, obtained by CNN.\n\n\n\nBut here is the thing: Everyone in this administration, including President Pee-Pee, is vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians because this isn\u2019t even real life anymore; it\u2019s a bad episode of House of Cards, and the actors in this drama are a lot less appealing.\n\nSo it\u2019s all coming out in the wash as Flynn takes one for the team.

You read it correctly. Although there is some speculation that it might have been a mistake or a glitch in the matrix, a guest on a Fake News\u2014I mean, Fox News\u2014show uttered a nonfiction statement that was based in reality.\n\nDuring a one-on-one interview, the conservative icon and spokesman for white America Bill O\u2019Reilly engaged Trump on the Great Pumpkin president\u2019s schoolboy crush on Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. When O\u2019Reilly pressed the comb-over-in-chief about Putin\u2019s propensity for violence and history of killing Russian citizens, Trump responded, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What do you think\u2014our country\u2019s so innocent? You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nWhile the entirety of true-blue, red-state America was immediately thunderstruck with shock and disgust, the statement also flabbergasted black America to its core\u2014but for a different reason. The melanated watchers all simultaneously had the same subconscious thought:\n\n\u201cDamn! Donald Trump just told the truth!\u201d\n\nEvery mainstream news outlet in the country is currently running a version of ginned-up, patriotic outrage screaming, \u201cHow dare he equate us with a Russian strongman government!\u201d Trump\u2019s response startled the contingent of Fox News watchers for his blasphemous comparison of a communist dictatorship to the beacon of freedom and justice that is the United States. Meanwhile, most black people quietly whispered to themselves:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kinda right, though.\u201d\n\nYes, it is true that Putin\u2019s Russia is an autocratic, unyielding government that spies on its own and muffles any kind of dissent. Sometimes they even kill their own citizens. Americans don\u2019t believe their government would ever do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil they find out how police departments sent undercover agents to spy on and disrupt Black Lives Matter protests around the country. Until they discover the not-so-secret drone surveillance program the city of Baltimore used to watch its citizens during and after the Freddie Gray uprising. Until they read the unclassified FBI COINTELPRO files that say, \u201cThe purpose of this new counterintelligence endeavor is to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize the activities of black-nationalist, hate-type organizations and groupings, their leadership, spokesmen, membership and supporters.\u201d\n\nYes, we\u2019ve got a lot of killers.\n\nWe know that the FBI sent a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. threatening to blackmail him unless he killed himself. We remember how police murdered the most prominent Chicago Black Panther by firing between 82 and 99 shots into 21-year-old Fred Hampton\u2019s tiny apartment while he slept with his pregnant wife. We\u2019ve seen the declassified directive from J. Edgar Hoover to prevent the rise of a black messiah who could unify the black movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe could delve into how the woman who killed Emmett Till recently confessed after 60 years, or how Trump dismissively ordered a drone strike over dinner last week that killed bystanders and children in Yemen, or how no officer was convicted of murder or manslaughter for using lethal force in the line of duty (even when the victim was unarmed) from 2005 to 2015\u2014but there\u2019s no need for all that pesky evidence.\n\nTrust me, we\u2019re not so innocent.\n\nThere is a trite saying that \u201ceven a broken clock is right twice a day.\u201d Today media outlets will blast headlines and fill timelines with opinions and perspectives dissecting Trump\u2019s disastrous interview.

Recently, Geppetto (Putin) took up for his new boo thang (Mango Zedong) by addressing the now infamous dossier in which a former MI6 British intelligence agent claims that the Russian government has compromising information about the new U.S. president. During a press conference Tuesday, Putin said, \u201cThese things that have been alleged are clearly false information.\u201d\n\n(Because if you want truth, you turn to a man trained in the art of lying like hell for the advancement of specific agents.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the various forms of malarkey the lying head of state presented to a forced audience, though, this portion was particularly comical: \u201cDid Trump really come and meet with Moscow prostitutes?

It is hard to believe that he ran to a hotel to meet with our girls of a low social class, although they are the best in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is not how prostitution works, but it\u2019s clearly a sign of someone standing by his man. I suppose if the former KGB agent allegedly put in all that effort to housebreak his new pet, it would make sense for him to go above and beyond to protect him. You know, even if that means saying with a straight face that loads of women want to smash a man who looks like a pot of lasagna made from old slices of Kraft cheese.\n\nStill, it was already stomach-churning to watch an American campaigning to be president laud an authoritarian figure from a hostile foreign government, but now we have to spend maybe four years living with this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the crowds in Washington, D.C., were thin-crust pizza for the inauguration, it was apparently a lituation over in Moscow. Indeed, The Independent reported that supporters of Putin held an all-night party in celebration of the U.S. president who U.S. intelligence agencies all agree benefited from the assistance of the Russian government in winning the presidential election.\n\nAdam Lusher wrote: \u201cOne of the organizers, Konstantin Rykov, who has served as a Russian MP affiliated to Putin\u2019s United Russia Party and has also been described as a \u2018Kremlin web propagandist,\u2019 invited his Facebook followers to the event with the comment: \u2018See you in the evening. Washington will be ours.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the new administration\u2019s claims to the contrary, we undoubtedly will soon have to bear the sight of Mango Zedong and Putin standing side-by-side in jubilee like they\u2019re Ja Rule and Ashanti about to perform \u201cAlways on Time.\u201d While there is a special shade of irony in the guy who promised to \u201cMake America great again\u201d being so clingy to the de facto dictator of Russia, it is not enough to gloss over how infuriating it is to see such a low-level ruse happen in real time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor far too long, black folks have had their patriotism questioned.

Unfortunately, I presume that most people reading this kept their hands where mine are \u2014 in my pockets. And, like me, were very familiar with how the electoral college process worked, but never quite knew until this year that a member of the electoral college could conceivably just say \"Fuck it\" and choose against the candidate their state voted for.\n\nOf course, opting out has actually happened so few times before that the electors' choice is regarded as a formality. But this year's election has been so jarring and devastating that it's had us searching and hoping for any type of contingency plan or last second salvo to prevent the inevitable. Including, today, the paradoxical dynamic of having faith in the faithless elector.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty much confirmed now that Russia did attempt to sabotage the election, and that the purpose of their political vandalism was to help Donald Trump get elected. And while we're not sure if Vladimir Putin interfered because he has an affinity for Trump or because he believed a Trump victory would make America weaker (or both), it's also been confirmed that he was directly involved with the hacking.\n\nThis is not exactly new news.

Being pissed at Russia for the election is like being mad at the person who fucked your spouse.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying the previously blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time.

It centers on Maddy, a beautiful but socially awkward young woman who\u2019s allergic to everything\u2014the air, grass, germs\u2014and therefore has been sheltered from the world by her overprotective mother. But when a handsome teen named Olly moves in next door, he and Maddy strike up a friendship that changes her life forever.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you grew up watching your fair share of films like these\u2014think any movie with Julia Stiles from the early noughties\u2014and loving them. I was never short on crushes and obsessed with happy endings, because that meant there was hope for me. While my homegirls and I would spend hours trading snacks and one-liners about the latest young adult romance, there was one thing we\u2019d never see: black girls at the center.\n\nSure, my favorite films had black female characters: the sassy best friend, the tell-it-like-it-is homie, the super-smart nerd. But the black girl never got the guy, and if she did, she didn\u2019t keep him long. So when I watched Everything, Everything, I was pleasantly surprised to see Maddy, played by Amandla Stenberg, in the middle of it all.\n\nRecently, I spoke with the film\u2019s director, Stella Meghie, and its stars, Amandla Stenberg and Anika Noni Rose (who plays Maddy\u2019s mom), about the project, which was based on the popular book by Nicola Yoon. Though it is full of #BlackGirlMagic, discussions about race are absent from the film\u2014and that\u2019s what makes it so special.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nThis movie is full of Black Girl Magic. It has a black director, black stars, and is based on a book by a black woman. What was it like knowing you were creating this project that literally black women built from the ground up?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStella Meghie: When I read the project I was just like, \u201cIs this real? Are they making this? Is there a black girl in the lead [and] are they [reaching] out to me too?\u201d To be able to add Amandla and Anika to the mix was just\u2026it just got stronger and stronger as it went along.\n\nAmandla Stenberg: I was just shocked and excited to come across a lead character in this type of film. We normally see these films with white girls carrying the movie. Then to see that it was going to be directed by a black woman and based on this book that was intentionally written for a biracial girl to play that role, and to be in this relationship with this boy and not have to have this big conversation about race kind of pushing the plot forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnika Noni Rose: I was very excited. I didn\u2019t realize in the beginning that Nicola was black because [of the name] Nicola Yoon. But it was enough for me because I was like, \u201cYoon, she\u2019s a woman of color, this is great.\u201d And then I found out that she\u2019s this amazing black woman writing these magical stories, magical realism, and we don\u2019t really get that very often. And then Stella called and I knew listening to her voice, and I was like, \u201cOh, ok, she\u2019s black.\u201d And then she said, \u201cSo, Amandla\u2026\u201d And I was like, \u201cIn!\u201d\n\nStenberg: Honestly, I\u2019m not someone who receives young romance scripts and thinks, \u201cOh, this is the one for me.\u201d Traditionally, when I\u2019ve received scripts for young adult stories, teen romance movies, I maybe look at for five seconds and think: \u201cThey\u2019re going to cast a white girl. Why did I get this script?\u201d\n\nI have an agent who will push for diversity and pitch me to studios and say, \u201cBut you could cast her black,\u201d and does it actually happen? Probably not. But when I got this, it was specifically written for a black girl and that kinda blew my mind. You think it wouldn\u2019t be that rare, but it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose: Not to have to talk about [race] in the script, there\u2019s so many life things that we\u2019re dealing with that aren\u2019t about what color we are, or what the world is trying to put on us, but just about the life that we\u2019re living. That she can have a relationship with the boy next door, who\u2019s just the boy next door\u2014not the white boy next door\u2014is refreshing.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the things I really loved about the film. As someone who grew up watching a lot of teen rom-coms like 10 Things I Hate About You, I was like \u201cWow, I wish I had this when I was 17.\u201d\n\nRose: I\u2019d like to have it now.\n\nStenberg: I\u2019m glad that we get to have it. I saw this and I was like, \u201cMy 14-year-old self would die having seen this.\u201d This magical, surrealist, kinda clever film that is made for teenagers and this girl gets to be whimsical and nuanced and a real person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou two\u2014Amandla and Anika\u2014have been in the business for a while, but this issue of casting and there not being a lot of roles for black women or women of color is persistent. I would think that maybe for someone like yourself [Amandla], it would be a different experience. But you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not.\n\nStenberg: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s always been that way, and it\u2019s always been rare to find roles that I could play and that are good roles. But I think it\u2019s shifting right now, and I think it\u2019s shifting for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that we\u2019re able to create our own content now and distribute it in a wide way without the studios and without the movie theaters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose: And without permission.\n\nStenberg: And without permission and without having someone to fund it and okay it. So I think studios are feeling that pressure, and they\u2019re feeling pressure to diversify, even if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nMeghie: Even if it\u2019s out of shame.\n\nStenberg: Even if it\u2019s out of shame, they have to diversify because it is a diverse world and we are demanding that content now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose: And it\u2019s money.\n\nStenberg: And they\u2019ll make more money that way.\n\nRose: You\u2019re just gonna pass over money? We go to see ourselves and other people go to see us because culture has changed, so that we really are mainstream culture, as quiet as it\u2019s kept. And you see something with the success of Get Out, which is strictly about race but brilliantly so, it said a lot more monetarily to the powers that be than it did just message-wise. So it would just be dumb not to follow that trail of green.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStenberg: I think we\u2014all three of us\u2014are positioned very interestingly at this point in time because these studios are wanting this content, and we\u2019re here, we\u2019re ready to go.\n\nStella, this is your second film; I spoke to you right after you finished shooting it. What was it like coming into Hollywood\u2014you had Jean of the Joneses, which was independent\u2014and now working for a studio?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghie: It was a very quick jump. We were talking about Jean when I was wrapping this, so it\u2019s back-to-back shooting films this year. It\u2019s a different process in a way, you get on set and it\u2019s the same, but there\u2019s more people to talk to on a studio film, more input.\n\nI was fairly lucky. I had some kinda risky ideas about how to bring the movie to life with some of the more surreal and fantasy elements that aren\u2019t in the book and they trusted me. It\u2019s difficult and it\u2019s hard, but I had a fairly good time doing it. I think it was serendipity that this project came up right at a time when I kinda had a voice that spoke to it. I love both avenues. Whether you\u2019re doing independent [films] or whether you\u2019re doing studio, it just depends on the story you\u2019re telling and who wants to put money behind it.\n\nEverything, Everything is in theaters nationwide May 19.", "keywords": ["women", "talking", "films", "youre", "amandla", "blackgirlmagic", "movie", "girl", "young", "black", "think", "film", "woman"], "polarity": 0.18716881489437873, "subjectivity": 0.548188924692684},

Today they appear thick as thieves, both seemingly involved in a two-front, rigged-election war to blow up the black vote. A Trump presidency catapulted by angry, white populism is already a scary thought.\n\nBut as bad as that is, consider the possibility of the most significant election in three generations being bootlegged by a combination of GOP tinkering with voting rights and Russian sabotage of American electronic-voting systems.\n\nWhile Republican state legislatures are busily passing voter-ID requirements in response to a fictional fraud crisis, or eliminating early voting and erecting any number of creative barriers for black and brown millennial and senior voters, Republican governors are shutting down motor vehicle offices in black counties or closing up polling stations.\n\nSince 2010, that\u2019s culminated into voter-ID laws in 31 states and freshly baked systematic voting restrictions this presidential year in 14 states\u2014everything from no early vote to curtailed absentee ballots and fewer places to vote. Watch big election-battleground states like Pennsylvania, where Republicans will unleash obstructive \u201cpoll watchers\u201d to actively profile and intimidate key voting blocs.\n\nSimultaneously, on a cyber-instigated Eastern front, Kremlin-backed hackers are reportedly looking for ways to manipulate this American election. Doing so entails disrupting voting databases and digital processes in states full of black and brown voters more likely to vote Democratic, since Russian President Vladimir Putin is not a fan of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no evidence of any formal evil alliance between the Republican Party and the Kremlin. But it is mighty convenient how their interests converge these days into one nicely packaged political bromance. Each is engaged in some form of Election Day trickery that has one theme in common: keeping black voter turnout as low as possible.\n\nThe cozy alignment of Republican and Russian political interests is probably not what GOP nominee Donald Trump meant when he suggested we\u2019d be in for a \u201crigged election.\u201d But if there\u2019s anything rigged happening, mounting evidence is pointing in that direction.\n\nNearly 40 years ago, Republicans got \u201cthe great communicator,\u201d B-list actor Ronald Reagan, elected on the strength of collective American hate for (and fear of) the \u201cSoviet empire.\u201d At that time, Russians were sickle-and-hammer bad guys hell-bent on global Communist domination (translation: the other competing neocolonial power on the block).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat summed up our cynical worldview that our planet was on the cusp of nuclear obliteration; not to mention an endless cinematic catalog of Cold War propaganda in which psychopathic commandos and misogynistic fighter pilots routinely killed Russian soldiers for sport. Republicans gleefully force-fed us the \u201cevil empire\u201d trope till the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nToday, however, in a head-exploding plot twist, the GOP\u2019s presidential team loves them some police-state Russian junta. Since both presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Gov. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) regularly use Putin as the supreme-leadership model while throwing thinly veiled black-people-can\u2019t-run-things bigotry at President Barack Obama, few\u2014if any\u2014prominent conservatives have called them on it. Trump is well-known for doubling down on publicly telegraphed love notes to the once-wily Soviet secret-police agent, and he\u2019s already said he hoped that Moscow had hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s server in order to release her deleted emails.\n\nShortly thereafter, suspected Russian cyber intrusions effectively took out the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee\u2014a chief GOP political rival and road-blocker to the White House. And now, strangely enough, both FBI Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson confirm that there\u2019s a lot more to it: State-sponsored Russian hackers appear actively engaged in breaching voting systems, registries and databases in nearly 20 states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussians are suspected in breaching voter-registration databases in Arizona and Illinois, the former a sudden battleground state for Republicans scared of a Latino-voter uprising and the latter state holding large black populations needed to unseat GOP incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk in a Democratic bid to retake the Senate majority.\n\nFaced with imminent demographic doom, Republicans have been doing some election hacking of their own, although, instead of using technology, they\u2019re ignoring a declining voting infrastructure and using legislation to limit voting rights.\n\nBad enough that America\u2019s voting infrastructure is woefully underfunded and dangerously outdated as is. There hasn\u2019t been a real investment in voting-machine technology since the federal government, embarrassed by the paper-ballot Florida fiasco of 2000, halfheartedly dropped more than $2 billion into electoral modernization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, however, it just hasn\u2019t been a priority in Washington, and many Republican-led state legislatures have put more energy and cash into cooking up a faux voting-fraud crisis than securing our ability to exercise that most sacred right: voting.\n\nAs the Brennan Center\u2019s Christopher Famighetti tells The Root: \u201cIn November, 42 states will be using voting machines that are over 10 years old. Thirteen states will be using machines 15 years or older. That\u2019s close to the end of most voting systems' life span.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t expect our desktop or laptop to last for 10 years,\u201d he adds.\n\nDusty voting machines for the world\u2019s leading democracy present the feds with some horrific scenarios, thereby making Trump\u2019s claim of a rigged election almost prescient (if not a veiled admission of guilt). All five states that rely completely on touchscreen voting\u2014Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey and South Carolina\u2014have massive black populations, with many that would prove critical in close presidential and down-ballot races (Georgia is becoming one such state, for example).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther important battlegrounds, like Pennsylvania and Virginia, where black voters will make the decisive difference, house counties with totally paperless voting systems. And many of those 20 states vulnerable (pdf) to Russian hacking are the same places where Republican state legislators and governors have gradually chiseled away at voter access.\n\n\u201cMany of our government processes, including elections, rely on digital systems that must be adequately secured at each stage in the process,\u201d warns Carbon Black\u2019s Ben Johnson. Yet the shared failure of state legislatures and a Congress hostile to voting rights to do just that\u2014despite calls to treat our voting machines like critical infrastructure\u2014proves that it\u2019s all about the win for some \u2026 even if it means taking us back 50 years while they're at it.\n\nMake sure you protect your vote in this critical election for America.

Michael Bongiovanni pulled Hollins over for not having a license plate, a police report indicates.\n\nHollins told CNN that the license plate was in the rear window.

The Taser stopped and that\u2019s when he just did it again.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Hollins was determined not to move again, according to the news network.

It cleverly tells the common, opposing narratives that occur between these communities when police go Rambo. Starr has to navigate between two worlds where her friend is seen either as a victim or as a criminal.\n\nThomas began writing The Hate U Give after the 2009 fatal shooting of Oscar Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old black man in Oakland, Calif. After a reportedly heated auction among major publishing houses, HarperCollins acquired the novel for an undisclosed but apparently sizable amount. It has been breaking barriers ever since.\n\nThe Hate U Give is currently No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list in the Young Adult Hardcover category.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying the previously blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was actually described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel.

The Taser stopped and that\u2019s when he just did it again.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Hollins was determined not to move again, according to the news network. However, that didn\u2019t stop a second police officer, Robert McDonald, from running to the scene and kicking Hollins, who was now handcuffed, in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Bongiovanni] put me in handcuffs and I thought the whole ordeal was just over with, and that\u2019s when I seen another officer come out of nowhere and straight drop-kick me in the face; just stomp on my face,\u201d Hollins said.\n\nAnother witness recorded the kick on camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe revelations uncovered in this entire investigation are shocking. We are fortunate that this second video was found and we were able to move swiftly to terminate a supervisor who lied and stepped outside of his training and state law,\u201d the Gwinnett County Police Department said in a press release.\n\nBoth officers were terminated a day after the videos surfaced online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, CNN notes, the Gwinnett County solicitor-general has tossed out the case against Hollins, along with 88 other cases in which Bongiovanni and McDonald were the principal officers or key witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe actions of these officers completely undermine their credibility and they cannot be relied upon as witnesses in any pending prosecution,\u201d the solicitor-general\u2019s office said in a release Friday.\n\nThe department also has launched criminal investigations into the behaviors of both officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are crimes. It\u2019s not something that you do in the line of duty. They are above and beyond the scope of what a police officer should be doing,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIf these officers saw Demetrius do what they did to him to someone else, they would immediately put him in jail and he\u2019d be tried and convicted\u2014so we want the same thing to happen to them.\u201d\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["officer", "county", "cops", "traffic", "stop", "life", "beaten", "hollins", "bongiovanni", "cnn", "demetrius", "thats", "21yearold", "officers", "report", "ga", "video", "gwinnett", "feared"], "polarity": -0.025657894736842112, "subjectivity": 0.3416666666666667},

As the producer behind Fergie\u2019s biggest hits, he saw Iggy as the second coming and wanted to groom her into a pop star. But Iggy had a much different vision\u2014she wanted to be a hardcore rapper.\n\n\n\nPolow had met her earlier that year, when he hosted a party for the LA Lakers in his Atlanta home. Iggy stood out in the room, a tall white blonde among basketball players and music industry figures. Polow remembers the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe just looked exotic,\u201d he says. \u201cShe looked like a star. If she was in entertainment, I wanted to work with her. If she wasn\u2019t, I wanted to talk to her, try to take her out on a date or something.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin months, Polow flew Iggy from Atlanta to LA. For a few weeks, she shadowed him in the studio, meeting icons like Timbaland and Dr. Dre and superstars like Chris Brown, who saw her and, according to Polow, wondered, \u201cWho the fuck is that?\u201d By then, Iggy had cycled through a series of mentors who pushed her toward pop. They also taught her how to rap. Polow was just about last in the lineup before she met T.I., the rap star who would help her create the \u201csuper hood shit\u201d Polow says she envisioned.\n\nBack then, Polow didn\u2019t see her vision. \u201cI told her, \u2018Nobody\u2019s gonna buy you being hood,\u2019\u201d he says, adding that their relationship dissolved, in part due to creative differences. While Polow moved onto another white rapper, Chanel West Coast, Iggy was on her own.\n\nShe never quite got her hood pass. But by the summer of 2014, Iggy had become a star, marooned between pop and rap. She no longer obsessed over labels, telling Vanity Fair in 2015, \u201cI don\u2019t care if people think I\u2019m pop or rap.\u201d It helped that her No. 1 single \u201cFancy\u201d had successfully smothered the summer, positioning Iggy as a definitive, if not strongly desired, successor to Nicki Minaj. \u201cFancy\u201d and a guest verse on Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cProblems\u201d made Iggy the first artist since The Beatles to have her debut singles simultaneously top the Hot 100, and with that came big collaborations (Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears), a global fanbase, and a Wilhelmina Models contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen suddenly, her fast-track American success story turned into a cautionary tale. Iggy became a punchline and went from being hailed as a white rap savior\u2014a potential salve in the lineage of bad white rappers\u2014to, three years later, being a digital-era Vanilla Ice, reduced to a viral talking point. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d made a perfect pop song. She was buried in public beefs (with Azealia Banks, Q-Tip, Papa John\u2019s Pizza), and drama that proved more stressful than entertaining, to the point of annoyance and then indifference. In a June interview with The Guardian, Halsey, who sang on the Chainsmokers\u2019 hit \u201cCloser,\u201d summarized Iggy\u2019s career in a flippant nutshell: \u201cShe had a complete disregard for black culture. Fucking moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.\u201d\n\nIggy, of her own admission, cracked in the thick of the outrage, thinkpieces, and nonstop controversy, partially riding that turbulent cycle into fame. A textbook problematic figure, she found herself at the center of debates about authenticity in hip-hop and cultural appropriation\u2014conversations that intensified amid continuing national discussions about privilege and race. Her delayed sophomore album, Digital Distortion, is now a shot in the dark after an expected 2016 release and a June 2017 date that\u2019s come and gone. In the past year, Iggy has brought her frustrations about the delay to the public\u2019s attention by venting about it on Twitter. Her label, Def Jam, declined comment on the album\u2019s status, as well as requests for an interview or comment from Iggy. (In a June interview with Variety, Def Jam CEO Steve Bartels called the album rollout a \u201cbuilding process\u201d and said, \u201cThe most important thing is getting her back to a place where she\u2019s hot.\u201d)\n\nIn the meantime, Iggy\u2019s fans have grown anxious, T.I. has professionally disowned her, and her critics want nothing to do with her after one too many offenses\u2014the racist tweets, the blaccent, Twitter feuds\u2014and not nearly enough good music.\n\nThe glamour of hip-hop worked its magic on Iggy, thousands of miles from its roots. \u201cI just knew I wanted to go to America and be a rapper and have a ponytail and a leopardskin jacket that went down to my feet, and like, 20 white, fluffy dogs on one leash,\u201d she told Dazed & Confused in 2012. She felt like an outcast herself, in a town where her rap tastes were rare, so she sought out rappers who were misfits and \u201ccaricatures\u201d\u2014Missy Elliott, Ludacris, Andre 3000. After standard jobs in retail and helping her mom clean houses (her dad was a children\u2019s book author), Iggy dropped out of high school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 16, she left her hippie parents behind to build a life she couldn\u2019t attain in little Mullumbimby, Australia. Her first American home, Miami, was a time of hustle, working small jobs and gift card scams while living with a boyfriend and making money as a non-US citizen. From there, she became a restless exchange student in multiple worlds\u2014America, hip-hop and black culture\u2014and it was in this overlap that she also became the living embodiment of white privilege.\n\nBy the time Iggy made it to Houston, in the spring of 2008, she was going by the rap name Regal, pronounced Reh-GAL. There, she met her first official rap tutor, a producer named Mr. Lee who discovered her music on MySpace when she was about 15 years old and told her to look him up when she turned 18.\n\nAround her 18th birthday, Iggy met with Lee at the headquarters of his label, Yippee Records. He introduced her to his crew, then took her to Saltgrass Steakhouse, a Texas-based family style chain. Later that night, in Lee\u2019s home studio, Iggy showed off her rap skills. It was clear that she needed work. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy into her because of the rapping. A journey had to be taken to get her to be a good rapper,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWhat I saw was a model, an entertainer, an actress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of a year, Lee taught Iggy the basics of flow and how to harness her natural charisma. She credits him for also teaching her \u201chow to rap like a girl,\u201d despite her desire to be more like 2Pac. This presented a slight challenge\u2014a white girl who wanted to be hard, but rapped like Alex Trebek reciting lyrics on Jeopardy.\n\nA journey had to be taken to get her to be a good rapper.\n\nWhile working in the studio, Lee introduced Iggy to Maurice Williams, a then 33-year-old former Christian rapper with multiple aliases, including Jefe Wine, Wine-O and Enzo. Williams wore many hats: Iggy\u2019s chauffeur, co-writer and, later, her boyfriend. In collaboration with Lee, Williams walked Iggy through rapping, teaching her how to organize hooks. The two convinced her to record a few pop-leaning demos, though Lee says, \u201cIn her mind, doing pop music was a sellout.\u201d\n\nThey made about six songs, Lee recalls, including an \u201980s jazzercise record titled \u201cU Ain\u2019t My Daddy,\u201d where Iggy lectures a possessive dude: \u201cS\u2019posed to be my man/but you act like my babysitter,\u201d she raps. Her blaccent is thick, flow disjointed, but the musical style is much more J.J. Fad than T.I., a distinct departure from the Southern rap imitations that eventually became her signature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January 2009, Iggy and Williams moved to Atlanta, where their relationship ended. Details later became public, after Iggy filed a lawsuit against Williams in 2014, accusing him of copyright infringement over those early recordings, which Iggy claimed he\u2019d stolen from her laptop and released illegally. In court testimony, Iggy described Williams as her \u201cfirst ever serious boyfriend,\u201d said they lived together and that they broke up in 2009 after a \u201cmassive, massive fight\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day. Williams, in his testimony, couldn\u2019t recall the fight. He claimed that Iggy reneged on a management contract when she signed to a major label. A judge later ruled his contract invalid.\n\nIn the midst of her teachings, Iggy\u2019s business dealings got messier. Around 2008 in Houston, through Mr. Lee, she also met Jon Jon Traxx, a producer who says he connected her to music executives, choreographers and prominent producers over two years. Last year, he filed a $1.5 million breach of contract lawsuit, which was settled this past July. Jon Jon Traxx declined a request for an interview, stating via email: \u201cThanks for reaching out, but I\u2019m not doing any interviews that has [sic] anything to do with Iggy.\u201d\n\nA pattern began to emerge: Iggy had fragments of talent and a ton of audacity. Her talent mattered less than her looks. The producers she worked with saw her more as a total package: an edgy white female rapper with pop appeal. But Iggy emphatically protested whenever she was steered in the direction of a Fergie, Gwen Stefani or Britney Spears.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the first songs she recorded in Atlanta was \u201cNothing Like Me,\u201d a bargain-bin version of Spears\u2019s \u201cWomanizer\u201d that features no raps, just her digitally enhanced vocals. When the song and music video leaked in 2014\u2014and sounded nothing like \u201cFancy,\u201d where Iggy proclaimed to be \u201cin the murda bidness\u201d\u2014it seemed to confirm her status as a rap poseur.\n\nPart of Iggy\u2019s grab for authenticity was currying support from credible rappers. Around 15 years old, she reached out to Backbone, a member of the Outkast-affiliated rap crew the Dungeon Family, on MySpace. Iggy would send him videos of herself rapping in her bedroom and messaged him so often that Backbone gave her top-10 placement in his MySpace profile. Years later, when she made it to Atlanta, she suggested they meet in person.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor about two weeks, Iggy had something of an apprenticeship with Backbone, who stresses that \u201cnothing inappropriate\u201d happened. He didn\u2019t sign her to a contract or make promises, he says. But he did teach her about bars and song construction. He introduced her to his grandmother, and Iggy ate fried chicken for the first time. She marveled at the plaques on his wall and told him, \u201cI want this.\u201d Their studio sessions, Backbone describes, were more like a \u201cproving ground,\u201d where Iggy would sit around with other artists\u2014the lone woman rapper\u2014and workshop selections from her rhyme book.\n\nThey never recorded a song, but her hustle and knowledge of hip-hop impressed him. \u201cThere was definitely talent there. She could rap over Southern beats, New York style beats, California beats,\u201d he says. \u201cBut her accent was so thick, people couldn\u2019t see her becoming a rap star.\u201d\n\nA friend of Backbone\u2019s recently expressed shock that he\u2019d had a hand in Iggy\u2019s success. \u201cPeople still look at it like she\u2019s not talented, but she\u2019s one of the greatest female MCs there is,\u201d says Backbone. \u201cI\u2019m going on record with that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetworking around Atlanta led Iggy to Polow, who figured that as a pop-rapper, she could lure a broad base\u2014more specifically, black men. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna attract the black guys, when you got an ass that big,\u201d he told her. At the time, Iggy had been working out furiously, up to four days a week, and taking performance training as part of consultations with Atlanta\u2019s Marvelous Enterprises Artist Development Center, a service that promotes itself as \u201ca superstar-training site.\u201d\n\nBesides seeing Iggy\u2019s potential as a cash cow, strangers were willing to give a young Australian girl a chance, largely off sight\u2014the sort of latitude that white and pretty privilege affords. Still, four years into her tutelage, Iggy\u2019s peers (Polow included) were unimpressed with her raps, which again posed a slight issue for an artist who wanted to be respected as a rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like when you meet an artist and they\u2019re a few songs deep. It\u2019s like, oh no, you really have to learn how to rap,\u201d says a former colleague of Iggy\u2019s who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cLiterally everybody told her she would never be a rapper, so it became something to prove, in a way that, to me, was very detrimental. She wanted people to be like, \u2018Yes, Iggy the MC!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe intro to Iggy\u2019s breakout song \u201cPu$$y\u201d comes from Eddie Murphy\u2019s 1992 film Boomerang, released when she was two years old. \u201cYou are going to turn down a pussy like this? Staring you smack in the face?\u201d Grace Jones taunts, repeating the word. This was many people\u2019s first introduction to Iggy, in late 2011, the same year that a flash-in-the-pan white rapper named Kreayshawn released her popular song, \u201cGucci, Gucci.\u201d The brass and coolness of \u201cPu$$y,\u201d which appeared on Iggy\u2019s 2011 mixtape Ignorant Art, along with her blatant sex appeal\u2014she established her signature look: cat eyes, red lips and a super high ponytail\u2014spelled potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIggy was skilled at conceiving creative campaigns, including mixtape artwork and videos like her freestyle \u201cTwo Times,\u201d where she presents herself spread eagle as graphics flash across her crotch. Iggy thought up the \u201cPu$$y\u201d treatment, based on Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 film Friday, and chose to shoot the video in the middle of the hood, on Slauson Avenue, a part of LA known for Crip activity. This was, in part, for the white-girl-in-the-hood aesthetic (\u201cWhite bitch down Slauson/Gangstas faint,\u201d she rapped on Ignorant Art), and because Iggy could film in her friend\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house for free. She edited the video herself using the raw footage given to her by its director, Falkon.\n\nImmediately, there was pushback over the video\u2019s imagery of a black boy seen draped over Iggy\u2019s shoulder while she rapped about pussy. The Bossip headline: \u201cAnother White Girl Rapper, But Why The Black Kid In This Video?\u201d When asked about the criticism, Iggy responded with irritation, telling Dazed and Confused in 2012, \u201cThose people can fuck off. They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, she wants to be black,\u2019 or, \u2018She doesn\u2019t give Australia props.\u2019 All that crap. What does that even mean?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis confusion persisted. Iggy had a visible love for hip-hop, but she seemed to be living out a fantasy. Whenever she speaks about her obsession with hip-hop, she recalls falling in love with 2Pac\u2019s \u201cBaby Don\u2019t Cry\u201d and hanging his posters on her wall. She cites Aquemini as her favorite Outkast album, talks about studying rap videos on YouTube (without fully grasping the context of the songs), and about writing her own sexually explicit raps at 14. As a teen, she traveled to nearby Lismore to witness rap cyphers, and her first Instagram picture, posted in February 2012, is a shot of Biggie on the cover of XXL. She became a student of hip-hop. But becoming a rapper would take more than that.\n\nDeveloping her rap voice\u2014a distinct high-pitched karaoke effect, like a Lonely Island parody\u2014was part of the illusion. When asked about Iggy\u2019s success in a 2015 interview with Sway in the Morning, Eve, the rapper, said: \u201cThe tone. The blaccent. It would be dope to hear her with her swag. What are you? Who are you? What is that?\u201d\n\nAt face value, the accent, a product of Iggy\u2019s teachings in the South, seemed like a callback to a familiar, grotesque costume. In a 2016 article, \u201cHow Iggy Azalea mastered her \u2018blaccent,\u2019\u201d the Washington Post cited a paper by linguists Maeve Eberhardt and Kara Freeman in which the authors contend: \u201cLinguistic minstrelsy is a form of \u2018\ufb01gurative blackface\u2019, in which white users of African American English (AAE) do not literally darken their skin with make-up as in turn-of-the-century minstrel shows, but in essence perform in blackface, drawing on linguistic and other symbolic elements that signify racialized ideologies to a wide US audience.\u201d\n\n2Pac didn\u2019t get gangster till he played Bishop in Juice. She got gangster when she joined Grand Hustle.\n\nIggy, coming from Australia, didn\u2019t quite understand her caricature. As a white artist in a predominantly black space, however, she studied enough to anticipate the criticism that accompanies every white rapper, from Vanilla Ice to 3rd Bass, Eminem, Fergie, Kreayshawn and Macklemore. She told Gawker, in a 2012 interview, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be the person that takes something and doesn\u2019t give homage to where it\u2019s from.\u201d Though Eminem wasn\u2019t exempt from backlash\u2014he had to apologize for using \u201cnigger\u201d in an old song\u2014what saved him from extensive lashings was the perception that he had a gift, which has the power to outweigh ignorance at any cost. Eminem was also fortunate enough to come up before the reactive news cycle that dramatizes plays in real time, though there were hip-hop magazines (XXL, The Source, Vibe) that questioned his credibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore recently, what saved Macklemore was a level of self-awareness. He excessively atoned for his sins in public and wrestled with his identity in songs, no matter how grating. Other white rappers wisely chose not to engage with critique, to focus on their music, or play the background. Iggy, on the other hand, was a foreigner thrice over\u2014white, a woman, Australian\u2014who responded to nuanced critiques with defensive retorts and had far fewer people convinced of her talent. Many of her issues seemed to stem from the desire for an assimilation she could never achieve. She could fake being American, sure, but she could not fake being black American. Not without pushback.\n\nWhen T.I. entered the picture in 2012, in the middle of her negotiations with Interscope Records, it was an opportunity for her most legitimate endorsement. Iggy landed a management deal with his label, Grand Hustle, and T.I. tagged along to her interviews, co-defending her cultural crimes. Meeting him was a turning point for Iggy\u2019s career to the extent that it influenced the contentious, enunciated Southern style of rap on her debut album, The New Classic. The connection allowed her to push the hardcore persona she desired from the start. Finally, she could rap about haters \u201cshootin\u2019 at me with a tommy gun\u201d and posture like her male rap peers.\n\nFabrications aside, her debut album contains a smart balance of street and mass appeal, though Iggy\u2019s flow leaves a noticeable stain. When paired with proficient MCs, her defects became glaring. On \u201cRunaway,\u201d a track on her 2012 mixtape Glory (which T.I. executive-produced), Pusha T\u2019s raps have a clean luster in comparison to Iggy\u2019s errant delivery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter partnering with T.I., Iggy phased out some of the creators behind her earlier, stronger material, according to the collaborators I spoke to, one of whom cited her rejection of an Interscope deal as one of several questionable career decisions. To the people around her, the cloning of T.I.\u2019s sound felt forced. Kareem Chapman\u2014T.I.\u2019s assistant at the time\u2014signed Iggy to a management contract in partnership with her ex, Maurice Williams. Chapman jokes, \u201c2Pac didn\u2019t get gangster till he played Bishop in Juice. She got gangster when she joined Grand Hustle.\u201d\n\nFrom \u201cPu$$y\u201d onward, the criticism grew. On her 2011 song, \u201cD.R.U.G.S.,\u201d Iggy borrowed a line from Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cLook Out for Detox,\u201d where he raps, \u201cWhen the relay starts, I\u2019m a runaway slave.\u201d On her version, Iggy flips it to: \u201cWhen the relay starts, I\u2019m a runaway slave/Master, hitting on the past gotta spit it like a pastor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an open letter posted in response to the subsequent criticism, Iggy wrote: \u201cKendrick Lamar is one of my favorite artists and I loved his song \u2018Look Out for Detox\u2019 so much I decided to do my own version of it last year. The lyrics I wrote follow the original version closely; One lyric in particular has offended a lot of people and for that, I apologize.\u201d Iggy\u2019s collaborators say she often used ghostwriters (specifically, black artists and songwriters) and that one of them penned that line. Her team didn\u2019t anticipate such a big blow-up. Iggy continued to commit infractions and perturb her respected peers.\n\nIn 2014, Q-Tip took up the cause of educating Iggy via Twitter about white privilege and hip-hop (read: black) history. Iggy responded with a tweet: \u201ci find it patronizing to assume i have no knowledge of something I\u2019m influenced by, but I\u2019ve also grown up with strangers assuming that.\u201d The next year, on stage at the Soul Train Awards, Erykah Badu described Iggy\u2019s music as \u201cdefinitely not rap.\u201d In response, Iggy tweeted about being discredited for her accomplishments. In January 2016, she got into another Twitter fight with Talib Kweli after Macklemore name-dropped her in his song \u201cWhite Privilege II.\u201d Kweli tweeted \u201cFuck Iggy Azalea, adding: \u201cShe\u2019s disrespected hip hop culture one too many times.\u201d Iggy responded by pledging her love of hip-hop and suggested Kweli \u201ccome to grips\u201d with the genre\u2019s expansion. Months later, she was chastised when she took offense to white women being called \u201cBecky.\u201d\n\nIggy\u2019s cultural blind spots were most remarkably transparent through her feud with Azealia Banks, an erratic rapper from Harlem who welcomed the friction. Banks was quick to question Iggy\u2019s cultural affixation and hated her ability to wear the costume of rap without any of the struggle. She referenced Iggy\u2019s old racist tweets and repined that her own voice got lost in the madness of Iggy mania, in the ultimate show of white privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Iggy and her publicity team had a philosophy, at first, to ignore the backlash. \u201cEspecially with Azealia Banks,\u201d says Brian Scully, Iggy\u2019s publicist from 2011 to around 2014. (He says Iggy received no formal media training at the time.) \u201cShe knew that wasn\u2019t a public argument she wanted to get into, especially being new. Obviously, at a certain point that strategy went to the wayside.\u201d He adds, \u201cNobody really ever had control over her.\u201d Certainly, autonomy is a good thing in an industry that tries to restrict women\u2019s voices, but ultimately damaging under the circumstance of repeated ignorance.\n\nScully thinks Iggy\u2019s social media strategy shifted for the worse after 2013, when she started working with a UK management team, Turn First Management, which counted Rita Ora as a client. At that point, Iggy relocated from the U.S. to Wales to record The New Classic. \u201cThe UK team was much more guarded,\u201d says Scully. \u201cBecause of all the controversies, because she was a loose cannon to an extent, they wanted to corral her in a bit.\u201d (Iggy\u2019s former manager Sarah Stennett declined to comment.)\n\nNobody really ever had control over her.\n\nWhat made Iggy\u2019s gangster aesthetic more tragic was her increasingly tone-deaf approach. The more defensive she became, the more she centered her work around a white female struggle, the more the critiques of her deficiencies devolved into apathy. Imprudently, she took to using her whiteness and sexism as a shield. \u201cThe Rolling Stones go to America, play \u2018black\u2019 blues music, and nobody has a fucking issue with it or thinks it\u2019s weird,\u201d she told Complex in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than seeing race as an issue, Iggy focused on the trend of women in rap being over-policed and accused of not writing their own rhymes, while in the process overlooking how artists like herself and Macklemore hold a broader industry advantage, even as they feel like outcasts in their field. To push forward the idea that no one can borrow from another culture is unproductive, when the issue revolves more around the nature of profit, preservation, and which party gets to capitalize while the other is traditionally marginalized. As Jeff Chang explained in a 2014 essay for The Guardian:\n\nIs hip-hop only for black people? It is an irrelevant question. Few black hip-hop artists have ever made that argument. But to say that hip-hop begins as black culture made by black people is not just a statement of fact, it is an acknowledgment of the master key that opens the door for everyone, the way a clave unlocks a rhythm.\n\nIn Iggy\u2019s case, there\u2019s an entire continent of disconnect. Of course, she would use American rap (the most accessible genre) as an aspirational model, having few hometown templates to mirror, and, naturally, she would feel sidelined in a men-dominated industry. Above all, she knew hip-hop could make her money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Iggy genuinely bought into and enjoys hip-hop because the profit model was something not commonly seen in Australia,\u201d says Dr. Timothy Laurie, a communications professor at the University of Technology Sydney. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that she finds, within African-American hip-hop, examples of femininity that she strongly identifies with that she doesn\u2019t identify with in, say, white femininity in Australia.\u201d\n\nLaurie points to issues with white Australian artists failing to grapple with their white identity in an indigenous setting, let alone American racial politics. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the lack of intersectional thinking is particularly unique to Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cWhite Australians might be more likely to place the emphasis on \u2018Australia versus America\u2019\u2014David and Goliath\u2014rather than on other cultural differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nature of acceptance in hip-hop continues to evolve just as the conversations around appropriation remain stagnant, with little movement outside of familiar talking points. There\u2019s a sense that nuance has gotten lost; in a recent essay for Current Affairs, for example, Briahna Joy Gray argues in favor of the terms \u201ceconomic exploitation\u201d and \u201ccultural disrespect\u201d (versus appropriation) to emphasize how much \u201cnon-white cultural products are often considered more valuable or esteemed when performed by whites.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the genre\u2019s expansion has become a point of pride, Iggy\u2019s ascent is the worst-case scenario of a white artist from a foreign country seemingly trying to wrest culture away\u2014and getting by on mediocrity\u2014in the service of living out a fantasy. She also, in many ways, represents a portion of hip-hop fans who care less about appropriation and credibility than older generations do.\n\nThe necessity to rap with competence has changed, to that end, with paint-by-numbers rappers of all kinds simultaneously making popular radio hits while facing critique. No one is exempt from clowning. There\u2019s an infamous viral video of Iggy rapping the lyrics to her song \u201cD.R.U.G.S.\u201d in gibberish, and another video of her freestyling on Sway in the Morning in 2013\u2014which later turned into a meme. Instead of off-the-cuff rhymes, Iggy rapped pre-written lyrics from her song \u201cNew Bitch,\u201d failing the hip-hop quiz.\n\nAs Sway in the Morning\u2019s longtime host and hip-hop sage, Sway Calloway considers himself a purist. He\u2019s protective of tradition while acutely aware of a losing grip on ownership\u2014a fear that\u2019s manifested itself through Iggy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she went through the controversy with Q-Tip, she could\u2019ve handled it differently, instead of getting into a public debate. From that point on, I tuned out,\u201d says Sway. \u201cI also think people gon\u2019 have to get a grip with the fact that rap isn\u2019t just ours no more. There are people all over the world expressing themselves through this art form that don\u2019t know the basic fundamentals. People who have nothing to do with the culture can walk in, take full advantage of it, then walk away and get away with it.\u201d\n\nIggy didn\u2019t have much of a clean getaway, because her ascent dovetailed with the dawn of the thinkpiece era\u2014the proliferation of essays that were part of a broader, swelling cycle of online criticism around race and identity. As Slate surmised in 2014, the speed and quantity of criticism gave off the impression that there were \u201cmore thinkpieces published nowadays than at any previous point in history, as print publications with limited column inches have given way to Web outlets hungry for content.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Forbes published an article in 2014 titled \u201cHip Hop Is Run By a White, Blonde, Australian Woman,\u201d the site was forced to change the headline to \u201cHip-Hop\u2019s Unlikely New Star: A White, Blonde, Australian Woman,\u201d after angry feedback from readers annoyed with the thought of a white woman running hip-hop. That same year, Salon published \u201cIggy Azalea\u2019s post-racial mess: America\u2019s oldest race tale, remixed,\u201d and The Daily Beast wrote \u201cThe Cultural Crimes of Iggy Azalea.\u201d\n\nHer mere presence offended people. \u201cIggy was in the right place and the right time to become the object of that specific critical gaze,\u201d says Robin James, an associate professor of Philosophy at UNC Charlotte who covers pop culture. \u201cBut she should be subject to that criticism. It should be an uncomfortable space for a white artist to appropriate black music. It\u2019s only because of her white privilege that Iggy can be in that uncomfortable space but not have it get in the way of her career.\u201d\n\nFrom the outside, the barrage of criticism did seem to affect Iggy\u2019s livelihood. In March 2015, she cancelled her Great Escape Tour. While Billboard reported low ticket sales, an AEG Live rep claimed the tour was \u201cselling well.\u201d Chris Anokute, the A&R who signed Iggy to Island/Def Jam in 2013 and now works at Epic Records, thinks her label \u201covershot\u201d and overestimated Iggy\u2019s potential to book arenas based on one album\u2019s worth of material. (Iggy herself said she just needed a break.) Other deals simply disappeared. T.I. severed ties, and according to Wilhelmina Models, Iggy is no longer signed to the agency, though a rep didn\u2019t respond to a request for further details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid her career wreck, Iggy\u2019s love life seemed ever precarious. High-profile relationships with rapper A$AP Rocky and then Lakers guard Nick Young made her a gossip-blog regular, disposed to judgment about the optics of a young white woman seen dating solely black men and toeing the line of fetish versus preference.\n\nWith Young especially, the relationship was highly publicized, perhaps tactically, which included a GQ spread and openness about their engagement. When the couple moved into a home in LA, it made the blogs, and when Iggy moved out, that did, too. In June 2016, she and Young broke up, months after his Lakers teammate secretly taped him confessing to cheating and the video leaked online, another source of embarrassment. Since then, Iggy has been spotted with rapper French Montana.\n\nNone of the singles that Iggy has released in the past year\u2014\u201cTeam,\u201d \u201cMo Bounce,\u201d \u201cSwitch\u201d\u2014have come close to the aggravating allure of \u201cFancy.\u201d In that time, she\u2019s vented about the status of her album on Twitter at various points, including on July 8, when she reiterated that Digital Distortion had not been \u201ccancelled\u201d and that she was unhappy with all the delays. In yet another setback, a planned collaboration with her nemesis Azealia Banks\u2014an opportunity for a music moment slash promotional buzz\u2014has gone awry. A delayed album is far from an unusual scenario in the music business, but a telling one nonetheless.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Iggy\u2019s issues] have anything to do with people hating Iggy or thinking she\u2019s corny,\u201d says Anokute, her former A&R. \u201cThe songs just weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d Verse Simmonds, the co-writer of \u201cSwitch\u201d and \u201cMo Bounce\u201d is confident in Iggy\u2019s evolution and does his job of selling the project. \u201cEvery producer I know wants to work with her,\u201d says Simmonds. \u201cI think people are gonna be surprised with her lyrically this time around. That definitely was a major concern of mine. But I don\u2019t think we look to Iggy Azalea to be the greatest MC on Planet Earth. She is a pop rapper.\u201d\n\nAs much as her life has been an open book, it\u2019s been a challenge to get to the heart of who Iggy really is, behind the performance. As her former colleague puts it: \u201cThere has to be a narrative as to why I\u2019m still fucking with you.\u201d And if it isn\u2019t outstanding music or a lovable persona, there isn\u2019t much left to grab onto. \u201cShe is too private and at times comes off flat. I think they need to focus more on giving fans a 360 real-time view into her life,\u201d suggests Holly Baird, a veteran publicist and crisis manager. \u201cMost of her issues are racial appropriation or flat-out inappropriate. The time for her to address who she is and what she believes in is now.\u201d\n\nThat Iggy has had a revolving door of mentors, without a core group from the beginning, may speak to her weakened career and the risk she presents, as a contentious white female rapper who\u2019s best known for not being a very good rapper. Twenty years ago, she may have very well disappeared from the public eye, with one big song to her name and not much else. But as much as the outrage cycle has cursed her and possibly killed her career, she\u2019s also been fortunate enough to avoid being cast as a complete one-hit wonder, in an era where social media lets even the most ungifted of ghosts linger. What people want from her isn\u2019t great rap. It might just be a solid pop song. It might be nothing at all, or to simply embrace the power of mediocrity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe came out at a very interesting time,\u201d Polow notes. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a time where wack is actually average. So even if she\u2019s wack, at worst she\u2019ll be average.\u201d Besides, he adds, \u201cHow many artists do we come to love who aren\u2019t really that good?\u201d", "keywords": ["hiphop", "music", "song", "unmaking", "white", "black", "rapper", "making", "azalea", "iggys", "polow", "rap", "iggy"], "polarity": 0.07800942057942062, "subjectivity": 0.4186786602286601},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["different", "world", "production", "designer", "marvel", "told", "hannah", "walks", "important", "beachler", "black", "panther", "know", "africa", "wakanda", "studiosdisney"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

The eateries are south of the intersection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as I made my way to the northeast corner, there were several people on the corner, one of whom was a middle-aged white woman, probably in her mid- to late 50s.\n\nShe was waiting at the intersection to cross from the southwest corner to the southeast corner. She was standing on the edge, so I walked in front of her, onto the street that\u2019s been turned into a sidewalk.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe light running \u201cnorth-south\u201d was green, so cars were heading southbound in the same direction that I was walking. Let me also add here that I was on the phone as I was making my walk toward the eateries. I took ONE step onto the street, and this white woman GRABBED my arm and yelled, \u201cWATCH OUT,\u201d causing me to immediately jump, ALMOST into the very traffic she seemed to be trying to save me from, EVEN THOUGH I was in no harm and wasn\u2019t walking toward OR near the oncoming traffic.\n\nAs she pulled me back toward the sidewalk, I jerked my jacket and arm\u2014she actually got a piece of arm\u2014away and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t crossing the street.\u201d I took back my freedom and kept it moving to the eatery, probably Chopt. I like Chopt.\n\nIt was there that it dawned on me\u2014that white woman thinks she saved my life EVEN THOUGH she almost killed me. Not only does she think she saved my life, but she\u2019s probably going to tell others that she kept a young man from walking into traffic because he was on his phone and not paying attention, which is entirely untrue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, in the story of her life, she did a social good, a just good, and made sure that I\u2019d get the opportunity, at least for those next moments, to be all that I could be in life. She reached deep down into her bag of moral justice and \u201cinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice anywhere\u201d and made sure that I could become the next Martin Luther King Jr., though, really, she almost turned my life into a scene from Final Destination.\n\nI\u2019m over-emphasizing her race for a reason (for allegorical purposes). I don\u2019t know why she fake-saved my life. Maybe it was her motherly instinct, or maybe she just saw something that looked wrong to her, so she did her best to correct it. But I do know that much like American society, this white woman decided that something was wrong, completely devoid of facts, acted upon that decision and almost created additional calamity in the train wreck she was attempting to avoid.\n\nThat white woman was Congress, and I was the people. Or she was white people and I was the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t really know. Nothing is a clean parallel. Maybe it\u2019s a reach. What I do know is that there\u2019s a white woman running around Washington, D.C., who believes she saved my life, though what really happened is that she almost killed me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what that means, but by George, it means something. And I reallllly hope Sandra Bullock is available when my agent gets to callin\u2019.", "keywords": ["sure", "life", "thinks", "dont", "pretty", "really", "plays", "corner", "white", "saved", "killed", "eateries", "know", "street", "woman", "means", "sandra"], "polarity": 0.10914669955367629, "subjectivity": 0.3809519614752172},

It was hip-hop\u2019s first meaningful album from a female emcee.\n\nTwenty years ago marked the release of Bahamadia\u2019s Kollage, the best hip-hop album ever from a female rapper. With the help of D.J. Premier, Da Beatminerz and the Roots, the Illadelph rapper crafted a nearly profanity-free classic during hip-hop\u2019s renaissance.\n\nTwenty years ago marked the release of Fugees\u2019 The Score, which contains the greatest verse ever spit by a woman on wax: Lauryn \u201cL-Boogie\u201d Hill\u2019s verse on \u201cHow Many Mics.\u201d And there\u2019s a ton of competition on that one album.\n\nNineteen years ago marked the one-two punch of Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s Hard Core and Foxy Brown\u2019s Ill Na Na dropping just one week apart. Both rappers\u2019 increasing popularity at the time resulted in an organic competition to determine the reigning hip-hop queen of the five boroughs. (Both are dope, but Hard Core is a classic and has the best booklet art of all time.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne more: Sixteen years ago marked the release of Rah Digga\u2019s debut album, Dirty Harriet. It was the last time a female emcee released a full album that was truly banging.\n\nNow, I\u2019m getting old, so I realize I forget things from time to time. So someone help me out\u2014what meaningful impact has the double-X-chromosome set made in hip-hop in the past decade and a half?\n\nEven if you\u2019re a stuck-in-the-\u201990s n\u2014ga who can\u2019t appreciate any new rapper whose name doesn\u2019t rhyme with Schmendrick Flamar, you can come up with at least a half-dozen bona fide classic albums from male emcees that dropped since 2000. The only semirecent output from a woman that tickled hip-hop junkies is Nicki Minaj\u2019s career-making verse on Kanye West\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d in 2010. And even that s\u2014t is overrated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one with good sense would attribute this gap to female emcees being inherently inferior to their male counterparts\u2014Hill and Rah Digga in their primes would carpet bomb 2,371 percent of rap n\u2014gas in 2016. I would sooner attribute it to the gender bias that has always existed within the genre and culture.\n\nJust look at the tape: Ladies of the golden era\u2014including Lyte, Roxanne Shante, YoYo and Queen Latifah\u2014created legitimate classic records and albums before the turn of the 1990s ushered in an invidious trend of sexually marginalizing women in hip-hop that blights the genre to this day.\n\nN.W.A, Uncle Luke and the 2 Live Crew, in addition to early Death Row classics, stoked the fires of misogyny in hip-hop, as well as the trend of hypersexual female rappers. Women in \u201curban\u201d music got progressively more naked, and their lyrics raunchier to match their male counterparts. Even Salt-N-Pepa and TLC\u2014acts that typically empowered women\u2014started shedding clothing in their videos, to great financial success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Kim and Foxy came around, bars and butt-nakedness were kindred. Around the turn of the century, all the rap \u201csupergroups\u201d had a token bad chick who looked good in knickers and could deliver some serviceable, often ghostwritten, bars.\n\nKim and Ruff Ryders\u2019 Eve were among the more talented of them, but only one of them has anything near a classic. There were also Amil, Charli Baltimore and Vita (aka the jailbait from Belly), all of whom you probably completely forgot about until you read this sentence, and all of whom are probably working hard to get past lettuce and fries to make assistant manager. Because that\u2019s where the big bucks start rolling in.\n\nHill, who\u2019s been dragged to hell and back lately, was sui generis in 1990s hip-hop: She could spit, sing and was sexy without being a walking ad for Lovers Lane. Insert one of those \u201ckids these days will never know\u201d memes here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, Minaj and Iggy Azalea are the only two contemporary female rappers in the world that your average teenager can name, which is a tragic testament to women\u2019s role in the culture today. It\u2019s like our only two options are a habanero hot sauce colonic and being locked in a room with Tamar Braxton reading Dostoyevsky aloud.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear to me that Minaj is truly popular for her fashion sense and her insane, maybe-real, maybe-not, waist-to-ass ratio.\n\nOf course, Azalea is a hip-hop succubus who successfully tapped into that apparently large demographic that enjoys a pretty white girl who can do the hippity-hop at the barest of minimums. Every time \u201cFancy\u201d plays, I drop to my knees and say 10 Hail Marys and 20 Our Fathers, wherever I\u2019m at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there will likely always be women rapping about y\u2019all sorry n\u2014gas eating the box and liking it, it seems like a lot of the newer female rappers have placed a renewed focus on lyricism, on trend with their popular male counterparts like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. But none of them are getting a lot of push in the mainstream or the underground, and this is from a guy who actively seeks under-the-radar music that most of y\u2019all don\u2019t bother with.\n\nI combed through several \u201clady rappers about to blow\u201d articles over the past couple years for this piece, and none of them actually blew. We\u2019ve been waiting forever for Angel Haze to get real shine, but I tend to forget she exists. Jean Grae has perennially been on every about-to-blow list for a decade, but she only appeals to the hardcore, backpack-and-camo set. DeJ Loaf, despite her heavyweight industry connections, is chillin\u2019 somewhere in a time-share in One-Hit-Wonderville.\n\nNo one from 2007\u2019s Ego Trip\u2019s Miss Rap Supreme even has a Wikipedia page, outside of one-hitter-quitter Khia. Azealia Banks \u2026 ? Will. Never. Chart. Again. Ever. Bre-Z, aka Freda Gatz, is a real-life rapper portraying a fictional rapper on one of network television\u2019s hottest shows of the past decade; can you name one Bre-Z song?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRapsody is my favorite female rapper right now\u2014the heiress apparent to some of my favorite underground female rappers from the early 2000s, like Invincible, Eternia and N\u2019jeri Earth. But I\u2019m still waiting on her to cut the truly memorable album I know she\u2019s capable of.\n\nI am not sure what it would take to get the world caring about a dope lady emcee with a fantastic flow, awesome content and immaculate beat selection in 2016. Or maybe that\u2019s the issue: The female version of Good Kid, m.A.A.d. City simply hasn\u2019t been done yet.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for certain: When Views is the fastest-selling female rap album of the decade, something needs a-changin\u2019 soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDustin J.

That said, we realize that not all of you have, so gird your loins, because we\u2019re about to talk Dora Milaje. We\u2019ll try to avoid any spoilers.\n\nBAMorg via YouTube\n\nThe Dora Milaje\u2014Wakandan for \u201cadored ones\u201d\u2014first appeared in 1998, created by Christopher Priest during his tenure as writer of Black Panther. Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Why doesn\u2019t she have more than one facial expression? Why\u2014as my colleague Danielle Young asked\u2014didn\u2019t she just go for broke and call it \u201cWhite Savior\u201d? And why, nearly 30 years after the fact, did anyone think we needed a \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d reboot?\n\nBecause truly, that\u2019s what this is\u2014nearly four minutes of deeply Catholic iconography that offended even my former-Catholic-schoolgirl sensibilities (is Azalea even Catholic?). There were altars and pews, mourning veils and monks, baptisms and bastardized religiosity in feathered bustiers, complete with neon halos and crucifixes. All that was missing was a gospel choir and Black Jesus, as played by Leon (who likely would\u2019ve greatly improved this travesty, to be honest).\n\nAnd while I suppose we should be grateful that Azalea seems to have at least momentarily moved off of appropriating black culture to appropriate Madonna (who was appropriating ... but that\u2019s another post), what\u2019s really the most offensive thing about this release is that Iggy Azalea is now appropriating relevance. Because seriously, nobody asked for this, and Azalea for damn sure isn\u2019t the savior anybody needs right now, unless it\u2019s to save us from her. As The Root\u2019s Senior Editor Stephen A.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["solved", "im", "plan", "crime", "right", "nra", "racist", "donald", "lives", "trump", "gun", "white", "black", "stuff", "think", "know", "matter"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["adorned", "women", "work", "heavy", "designer", "armored", "jeweler", "feel", "jewelry", "black", "create", "panther", "douriean", "metal", "think"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying the previously blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was actually described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting; they were just plain racist.)", "keywords": ["knowing", "auditioning", "amandla", "world", "games", "work", "stenberg", "really", "young", "roles", "hunger", "black", "actress", "panther", "bowed", "place"], "polarity": 0.1305152529761905, "subjectivity": 0.4713665674603173},

Although authorities did not immediately go into detail about the suspects, the WTAE-TV anchor profiled them anyway.\n\n\"You needn\u2019t be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday,\u201d Bell wrote in the post that was later deleted. \u201c \u2026 They are young black men, likely in their teens or in their early 20s.

Bell's comments were denounced as racist; others accused her of having a white-savior complex, the Post notes. Within a week of her call to action, she was fired.\n\n\u201cWTAE has ended its relationship with anchor Wendy Bell,\u201d read a statement from the station\u2019s parent company, Hearst Television, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. \u201cWendy\u2019s recent comments on a WTAE Facebook page were inconsistent with the company\u2019s ethics and journalistic standards.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press after she was fired, Bell said, \"It makes me sick,\" adding that she didn't get a \"fair shake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat matters is what\u2019s going on in America,\" she continued, \"and it is the death of black people in this country. \u2026 I live next to three war-torn communities in the city of Pittsburgh, that I love dearly.

White guy leads rebellion of poor whites and runaway blacks in the Civil War? I expected another white-savior movie where the hero gets the post-racial bonus prize of the black girlfriend or wife for his efforts. Did seeing the film change my initial apprehensions? Yes and no.\n\nFree State of Jones is a good, but not great, film. It does an excellent job of laying out an amazing true story and offers some excellent acting and a few interesting action scenes. Most importantly, it succeeds at giving black folks some agency in their own liberation. Unfortunately, the movie lacks the courage to depict the complexities and contradictions that made this incredible Civil War rebellion possible.\n\nFree State of Jones drops you into 1862 during a bloody battle between Union and Confederate soldiers in Mississippi. Newt Knight, a Confederate solider (played by Matthew McConaughey), works feverishly as a field nurse, patching together what\u2019s left of soldiers in a battle field caked in blood. Director Garry Ross doesn\u2019t cheat you with voice-overs, some Basil Exposition character or an opening crawl. Instead, Free State of Jones organically lays out the reasons that drive Newt to his eventual rebellion against the Confederacy.\n\nThe Civil War Is \u201ca Rich Man\u2019s War and a Poor Man\u2019s Fight\u201d\n\nThe catalyst for the Knight rebellion is a combination of class and race that simmers under the surface of every interaction in the film. First, the \u201c20 Negro Rule\u201d was passed by the Confederacy, exempting the eldest sons of families with 20 or more slaves (i.e., rich folks) from military service. (Up North, rich people used the Enrollment Act of 1863, under which you could pay someone to take your place in the Army. Lincoln actually used this.) Second, the farmers in the South were being routinely raided for supplies by the Confederacy, meaning that many conscripted soldiers returned home to find that their wives and children were destitute or, worse, had died of starvation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFed up with the Civil War and fearing for the safety of his newborn son and wife, Serena (played by Keri Russell), Newt goes home and starts a ruckus. He trains women to fight off Confederate troops, which makes him a deserter and an outlaw. Serena, who was not about that outlaw-wife life, flees Jones County. Newt starts a rebel army in the swamps with the help of other Confederate deserters, house slave Rachel (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and runaway slave Moses (Mahershala Ali).\n\n\u201cCaptain Knight\u201d gives his rebels some incredibly rousing classic McConaughey speeches about how poor whites and blacks are both \u201cn\u2014gers\u201d and face similar oppression. It\u2019s a seductive message for today\u2019s audience, almost like a Bernie Sanders rally on income inequality. However, the film fails to make it clear exactly where Newton Knight\u2019s beliefs stem from. Is he a Civil War-era Tyler Durden, just looking out for the little guy? Or is he a hot-headed libertarian who wants to be left alone? Free State of Jones never fully explores those questions. This despite the fact that the film covers Newt Knight\u2019s legacy from the battlefield, to the Reconstruction ballot box, all the way up to the Mississippi Supreme Court in the 1950s. It\u2019s an ambitious story that falls just short of greatness.\n\nMaybe Knight Was Progressive by 1860s Standards; Not So Much by Today\u2019s\n\nNo period piece can cover everything. Events are streamlined, composite characters are created and timelines are fudged (although, to its credit, Free State of Jones has an accompanying website, which included historical footnotes). Consequently, Free State of Jones teaches us about Newt\u2019s character and politics mostly through his romantic relationships. Free State wants us to see Newt Knight as a progressive man on gender; he trains women to defend themselves and allows his \"first\" wife and son to return to the family farm even after he\u2019s taken up with Rachel as his common-law wife and had a child with her. We are also to believe he is a racially progressive man, teaching Rachel to read and ceding his land to her because he could not legally marry a black woman. Relative to other men at the time, Newt Knight wasn\u2019t just progressive, he was radical, but that isn\u2019t close to the complete story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is that Rachel wasn\u2019t just any slave woman. She was owned by Knight\u2019s father and bore children by his brother and possibly his father before he wifed her. Also, while Newt did take on a black wife, a scandalous act at the time, his sense of ownership over black women\u2019s bodies wasn\u2019t that far out of step with the times. He began a sexual relationship with Rachel\u2019s eldest daughter (who was possibly his niece) and had children by both.\n\nIt is true that Newt allowed his wife and son to come back to the family farm (a key element in a side story that takes his legacy up to a 1950s court case). However, he treated all the women under his charge like a typical slave owner. He continued to have sexual relations with his first wife, Rachel and Rachel\u2019s daughter, and forced many of his children to intermarry to keep their skin light.\n\nIf Free State of Jones did not spend so much time reminding us what a great guy Newt Knight was through his relationships, his marital peculiarities wouldn\u2019t matter. But it did, and they do. Showing the audience that Newt Knight was a bigoted, inbred Mississippi bigamist by our 2016 standards would have in no way diminished how radical and progressive he was in 1867. The movie\u2019s failure to do so cheapens what is otherwise a painstakingly accurate film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

Michael Bongiovanni pulled Hollins over for not having a license plate, a police report indicates.\n\nHollins told CNN that the license plate was in the rear window. Nonetheless, upon seeing Bongiovanni, Hollins said, he reached out to grab his cellphone. Hollins said he recognized the (now former) officer from a previous traffic stop back in August 2016 that did not sit well with him.\n\n\u201c[Bongiovanni] started yelling at me and saying that I\u2019m not going to get video of this: \u2018You\u2019re not going to make any phone calls; nobody is going to know about this,\u2019\u201d Hollins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBongiovanni ordered Hollins out of the car.

And it\u2019ll continue long after the ongoing crisis ends.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the new Netflix docuseries Flint Town coming out Friday. The eight-episode show has little to do with the water crisis that left the predominantly black city of nearly 100,000 exposed to lead poisoning\u2014yet, at the same time, it has everything to do with it. And it\u2019s necessary viewing for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist or ally to the environmental justice movement, in particular.\n\nThe cinematic show follows the actual Flint Police Department, an underfunded public service agency (like most others in the city), from 2015 to 2017. The riveting high-speed ride-alongs\u2014which include calls to murder scenes or drug busts\u2014give the viewer an exclusive look into the world of policing and, more importantly, the humans who make it up.\n\nA handful of the 98 officers who make up the police department\u2014the smallest number of officers to police any city of a comparable size in the United States\u2014afford directors Zackary Canepari, Drea Cooper, and Jessica Dimmock an intimate view of their lives.

Things were bad in Flint long before its water wasn\u2019t drinkable: Poverty has overwhelmed the community since 2000 when General Motors closed its car factory. And as Flint Town makes painfully clear, crime is everywhere.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this series shows us that environmental crises are never the only issue with which vulnerable communities have to deal. Years and sometimes decades of social ills compound to create the structure that allows these kinds of catastrophes to happen in the first place. The docuseries provides the important context to understand the ripple effects contaminated water had on the city and its residents. Residents no longer trusted anyone, including the police department. After all, city officials knew lead was in the water and failed to do anything for months and months.\n\nOfficers are forced to police under a veil of distrust while grappling with the ways the water crisis has impacted them, too. \u201cThere are a lot of officers living in Flint,\u201d said director Jessica Dimmock to Earther. \u201cAt the end of the day, they come into the station. They can\u2019t drink the water there. They\u2019re surrounded by water bottles. [The water crisis] is never far from their minds.\u201d\n\nWater bottles are always lingering in the background of this Netflix show. \u201cThat was intentional and also unavoidable,\u201d said Dummock. \u201cOnce your eyes become aware of it, you see [bottles] everywhere.\u201d It can be as subtle as a plastic water bottle near the kitchen sink or as clear as the packages and packages of water bottles sitting in the Flint Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Town not only offers stunning visuals, but it offers a real glimpse of what it\u2019s like to live and serve this community, challenging the stereotypical narrative around environmental justice. The movement was born out of a North Carolina black community fighting for the right to clean roadways. Today, it can mean a lot more.\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nSome scholars have been challenging what we define as our \u201cenvironment.\u201d Is it just the air we breathe? Or can it also include the stressful environment in which a person lives when police don\u2019t arrive at an emergency, or when a mother is worried about making the water pick-up deadline after working a 12-hour shift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll those environmental factors contribute and play off of one another,\u201d said director Drea Cooper to Earther. \u201cYou definitely see some of that through the series.\u201d\n\nSo though this show isn\u2019t about the Flint water crisis, I urge you to watch it. It\u2019s no Planet Earth or scientific expos\u00e9 of how lead leaches into waterways.

Authorities also have redacted on the police report the parts of the supplemental narratives from three other assisting officers at the scene, essentially hiding from the public the person\u2019s name and information about what they found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember that part about \u201cone more interesting tidbit\u201d from earlier? That was a red herring. Because there is one other thing you should know about this case:\n\nGardner Fraser is not just the son of \u201cfired Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\u201d Ryan T. Fraser. After Ryan Fraser lost his job in Jacksonville, he was somehow able to get another job in law enforcement. Luckily, it was in his hometown of Macclenny ...\n\nAt the Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nTo be fair, Ryan T. Fraser no longer works in Macclenny because he retired four months ago in October 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we know, according to law enforcement reports: Dominic Broadus was killed in an execution-style manner. Deputies responding to the call found at the scene of the crime the son of their former co-worker, along with another unnamed person whose identity they will not reveal. To date, no one has been arrested. In the intervening weeks, the family of the victim have been left in the dark, and the only answer they have received is, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. Just chill.\u201d\n\nSeems legit.\n\nBroadus\u2019 father, Dominic Broadus Sr., said, \u201cThe evilness of this crime has caused heartbreak and horror to me and the rest of D.J.\u2019s family, including his mother, his siblings and his son.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe father added:\n\nAt this point we know little about the investigation of D.J.\u2019s murder. Our hopes are that a competent and honest investigation will be conducted. We do know that the main suspect in the case, Gardner K. Fraser, is the son of a retired Baker County deputy sheriff. Understandably, the fact that our son was an outsider in Baker County and the suspect is a longtime, well-connected, Baker County resident, gives us concerns about the fairness of the process. As parents and citizens, we want and we demand a thorough, honest and unbiased investigation.\n\nActivists and community organizations in Florida, including the Dream Defenders, Black Lives Matter and Color of Change, are demanding transparency in the investigation. They say they believe that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department are covering up an execution to protect Gardner Fraser and the Fraser family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to The Root, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said that it does not comment on active investigations, explaining, \u201cOur top priority is to ensure the integrity of the investigation.\u201d The FDLE also said: \u201cOur role is to determine the facts of what happened, and we provide that information to prosecutors so they can make charging decisions. Once the investigation is no longer active, all information can be provided to the public.\u201d\n\nThe Broadus family have united with local and national groups from around the country to demand justice and transparency. They will hold a town hall meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 20, at 6 p.m. at the Emmanuel Church of God in Christ in Macclenny to engage the community and law enforcement in their search for answers.\n\nThey have also set up an online presence on Facebook and Twitter under \u201cJustice4DJBroadus\u201d and ask that anyone with information contact Detective Hollycross at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement at 904-360- 7100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Broadus family said, \u201cSolving this crime and punishing the evildoers will not bring DJ back to us, and although our hearts will be forever broken by this tragic event, justice for my son and our family is demanded.\u201d", "keywords": ["county", "law", "enforcement", "son", "broadus", "dj", "ryan", "fraser", "mysterious", "baker", "investigation", "sheriffs", "killing"], "polarity": 0.062419871794871774, "subjectivity": 0.4016025641025641},

But since she is no longer employed by WTAE (and apparently no longer employable), her only current job title is Professional White Woman.\n\nWhy is she no longer employed and employable?\n\nOn March 9, six people were killed in a backyard ambush in Wilkinsburg, a suburb of Pittsburgh. This was a tragic and especially heinous crime that attracted national media attention. In her response to this, Bell did what Professional White People are wont to do:\n\n\n\nMake it completely about herself. Make certain to remind everyone exactly how far her privilege stretches.\n\nIn a Facebook post written shortly after the crime, Bell baked a white-privilege layer cake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe made numerous racist assumptions about the assumed perpetrators and their assumed backgrounds; centered her post on how this all was making her, Wendy Bell: Professional White Woman, feel; and topped off the cake with a generous spray of \u201cIf more black people were like the smiling and shucking restaurant server my family met the other night, there\u2019d be less need for Professional White Women like me to don our capes\u201d icing.\n\nReally, if Wendy Bell gets tired of this dog-whistling journalist thing, she should audition for Chopped. Because her white-privilege layer cake was the best white-privilege layer cake I ever tasted. It was delicious. (And surprisingly light! I think she used gluten-free flour.)\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nBell\u2019s post went viral, with many people (including yours truly) calling her out for her arrogance and obliviousness. After the criticism reached a critical mass\u2014and after Bell\u2019s tepid nonapology\u2014she was reprimanded by her station. And then suspended. And then fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat has she been doing since then?\n\nWhatever Professional White Women do in their free time, I guess. Although, if you\u2019re a Professional White Woman, you don\u2019t actually have any free time. There\u2019s always an opportunity for you to professionalwhitewoman somewhere. A school board meeting, perhaps, where you can complain about the Somali students who recently moved into your district, making it more difficult for your daughters to make soccer teams.\n\nOr maybe her services were required at someone\u2019s job, where a Professional White Woman was needed to send passive-aggressive emails to human resources about a colleague\u2019s \u201cphysically threatening email punctuation tone.\u201d She might have even been summoned to be present at some luxury-brand store in a mall somewhere so that she could make suspicious and manager-gesturing faces at a young black couple who don\u2019t look like they\u2019re supposed to be able to shop there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know for certain, however, that she definitely did retain a lawyer.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo sue WTAE.\n\nFor what?\n\nRacial discrimination.\n\nWait \u2026 what?\n\nYup, you read it correctly. She\u2019s suing her former station for back pay, legal fees and her old job, alleging that if she wrote the same things about white criminals or happened to be black, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo ultimately she\u2019s saying she should have been allowed to say racially problematic things?\n\nPretty much.\n\nSo basically she\u2019s suing for the right to be racist?\n\nYup.\n\nAnd she wants her old job?\n\nRight.\n\nWhy would she want to go back to the station that fired her?\n\nBecause the national publicity that her actions and the reactions to her actions have given her has likely made her unemployable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo not only is she suing for the right to be racist, but she\u2019s also suing for the right to be so racist that no one else would dare hire her?\n\nIn a nutshell.\n\nShe really takes this Professional White Person thing seriously, huh?\n\nOf course! But can you really blame her? If her entire persona, her entire being, is centered in her Professional White Personhood, or course she\u2019d do everything in her power to retain its relevance. It is also not without precedent. American history is full of examples of Professional White People losing a bit of assumed white-people status and taking some sort of legal action to retain it. Even today, in 2016, the Supreme Court is hearing a case from a Professional White Woman upset that the University of Texas didn\u2019t kowtow to her aggressively average-ass ass. She\u2019s basically Oscar Mayer-turkey-bacon pissed that she\u2019s not being treated like Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes Wendy Bell have a case?\n\nYes and no. Yes, because I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if WTAE settled this instead of taking it to court. So that would be a win for her. But no, because her entire rationale for the lawsuit is a fallacy. Her saying that what happened only happened because she\u2019s white is like a Bengal tiger saying, \u201cIf I were a goat, you wouldn\u2019t have been mad at me for chasing and eating that gazelle.\u201d Because if the tiger had been a goat \u2026 it wouldn\u2019t have chased and eaten the gazelle. Only a tiger could have chased and eaten it\u2014because that\u2019s what tigers do. And only a Professional White Person would have said the things Wendy Bell said\u2014because that\u2019s what Professional White People do.\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nTrump still needs a vice president. And who\u2019s a better choice than an attractive and dense Professional White Woman who literally can\u2019t do anything else? If it worked for Sarah Palin, why not Wendy Bell?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon Young is the editor-in-chief of VerySmartBrothas.com. He is also a contributing editor at Ebony.com.

I am by no means claiming that I could have become an infamous black sheep artist \u2013 anybody who\u2019s ever heard me get a little too jiggy with my Spotify playlist knows that a record deal is not in the cards for me. But a Black girl who grows up in an environment with very heavy Hispanic influences, adjacent to Washington Heights? I get that. I grew up only a handful of blocks away from her. We even went to the same magnet school in the same school district.\n\nIn that vein, a lot of her present day brash \u201cgiveth-of-no-fucks\u201d attitude is something that is just very reminiscent of the neighborhood we grew up in. The abrasiveness she constantly presents the public with is something that I see every time I\u2019m walking up 155th street when I visit my mom, or when I\u2019m taking the 1 train and overhearing teenage drama that Xiomara can\u2019t seem to express at a coherent decibel level. The fact of the matter is that folks I went to middle school with and grew up around acted just like her; and, to be honest, a lot of them still act like that and they\u2019re closer to thirty now. I ultimately attributed a lot of Azealia\u2019s blunders to her immaturity and lack of real media training and I figured that in time, she would get over the antics and focus on keeping her fan base happy over everything else.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years now, and things haven\u2019t changed. Not only has her attitude remained, but her problematic commentary continues to ruin any goodwill that she has started to regain.\n\nAzealia has gotten a fair amount of internet high fives in recent days for rightfully pointing out that the Iggy Azalea machine has profited off and has been celebrated for a mimicry of Black culture. When TI clapped back at her harshly, Azealia continued to have a point when she mentioned that TI has never attacked another person as aggressively when defending Iggy \u2013 namely when Snoop went on his inexplicable social media smear of her. Azealia even coined the moniker Igloo Australia, for which I will forever be thankful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the same breath as her tearfully defending Black music and Black culture with all the CAPS CAPS CAPS that 140 characters can offer, she continues to abandon all nuance and conflate issues that have absolutely nothing to do with each other by inserting the recent Bill Cosby allegations into the erasure of Black history. This is not the first time she\u2019s done so. She\u2019s discredited all of the valid criticisms that she\u2019s had of Perez Hilton by leveling very homophobic insults his way, and the amount of insignificant beefs with other artists that she\u2019s instigated are too many to count.\n\nTwitter beefs aside, lumping Bill Cosby\u2019s rape allegations into Macklemore winning a Grammy and Iggy being able to call herself a \u201crunaway slave master\u201d without much backlash is just irresponsible. Tacking on Bill Cosby\u2019s chickens coming home to roost to the recent deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown \u2013 especially when Beverly Johnson so astutely dissected why it did not apply \u2013 continues to show that while there is value in asking celebrities to speak up on social issues, these subjects sometimes have a complexity that takes a bit more nuance then they're willing to offer.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in propping up the whims of an artist who is unable to really parse through the nuance of the racial topics she claims to be fighting for. She claims the \u201cthe blogs just don\u2019t want to keep it on the music\u201d, but at what point will she take ownership of her insistence on fanning the flames of discontent contributing to stalling her music career? Victim shaming and homophobia don\u2019t help her make her case as her being miscast as the \u201cbitter black woman\u201d \u2013 and frankly, even when she discusses points that she is on the money on, more than two follow-up questions have her veering so far off the tracks that you regret engaging her in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAzealia Banks continues to demand others take accountability for their actions while simultaneously refusing to heed her own mantra. This obstinate lack of self cognizance will continue to be an albatross on her career until she realizes that no matter the intent, being strong and wrong does not provide an incentive for potential new fans to be invested in her success.", "keywords": ["shes", "right", "music", "lot", "continues", "azealia", "wrong", "recent", "black", "nuance", "school", "went", "banks", "iggy"], "polarity": 0.07117424242424243, "subjectivity": 0.5194458874458873},

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

Gaines\u2019 mother and father were awarded $307,000 and $300,000, respectively, and $300,000 was awarded to the Gaines estate. There were no punitive damages.\n\nAccording to the Sun, the Gaines family was tearful after the verdict was announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other side, Baltimore County government attorney Mike Field said in a statement that the county was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision and \u201cis reviewing all of its options, including an appeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mother died, a child was unintentionally injured, and police officers were placed in mortal danger.

Royce Ruby, who fired the deadly shots on Aug. 1, 2016. The suit sought more than $42 million for Gaines\u2019 estate and her survivors.\n\nThe jury reached its verdict after nearly three weeks of testimony and legal arguments.\n\nGaines\u2019 case garnered national attention after videos she broadcast of the standoff went live on social media. Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S. Ruckle Jr. told the jury that when no one would answer the door, officers kicked it in, and the first officer to enter the apartment was \u201cconfronted with Korryn Gaines with a shotgun pointed right at him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Gaines\u2019 fiance left the apartment with their infant daughter, she remained behind with their 5-year-old son. Gaines, 23, remained inside her Randallstown apartment with tactical officers stationed in the hallway outside for six hours.\n\nRuby, who would ultimately kill Gaines and injure her young son, was posted just outside her apartment door\u2014which was cracked open.\n\nRuckle claimed that Ruby was in danger because although he was wearing tactical gear, his arms, legs and face were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ruckle, Ruby decided to fire into the apartment when he saw Gaines and her son go into the kitchen. The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

Although authorities did not immediately go into detail about the suspects, the WTAE-TV anchor profiled them anyway.\n\n\"You needn\u2019t be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday,\u201d Bell wrote in the post that was later deleted. \u201c \u2026 They are young black men, likely in their teens or in their early 20s. They have multiple siblings from multiple fathers and their mothers work multiple jobs. These boys have been in the system before. They\u2019ve grown up there. They know the police. They\u2019ve been arrested.\u201d\n\nBell then went on to describe the \"hope\" she felt after she saw a young black busboy going about his restaurant job while Bell was eating out with her family.\n\n\u201cIt will be some time before I forget the smile that beamed across that young worker\u2019s face\u2014or the look in his eyes as we caught each other\u2019s gaze,\u201d Bell continued in her post. \u201cI wonder how long it had been since someone told him he was special.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe backlash was immediate and severe. Bell's comments were denounced as racist; others accused her of having a white-savior complex, the Post notes. Within a week of her call to action, she was fired.\n\n\u201cWTAE has ended its relationship with anchor Wendy Bell,\u201d read a statement from the station\u2019s parent company, Hearst Television, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. \u201cWendy\u2019s recent comments on a WTAE Facebook page were inconsistent with the company\u2019s ethics and journalistic standards.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press after she was fired, Bell said, \"It makes me sick,\" adding that she didn't get a \"fair shake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat matters is what\u2019s going on in America,\" she continued, \"and it is the death of black people in this country. \u2026 I live next to three war-torn communities in the city of Pittsburgh, that I love dearly. My stories, they struck a nerve. They touched people, but it\u2019s not enough. More needs to be done. The problem needs to be addressed.\"\n\nNow, however, Bell has filed a lawsuit saying that if she were black, her post would have been received differently and she would not have been fired.\n\n\u201cHad an African-American journalist said the same thing, it wouldn\u2019t have generated the same quote-outcry-unquote,\u201d her attorney, Sam Cordes, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review Monday after the suit was filed. \u201cWhat she said was benign at best. President Obama has said similar things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit accuses WTAE-TV of violating the Civil Rights Act. Bell is demanding back pay and attorney fees, as well as the reinstatement of her job.\n\n\u201cHad Ms. Bell written the same comments about white criminal suspects or had her race not been white, Defendant would not have fired her, much less disciplined her,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nThe suit also charges that Bell's bosses encouraged her to engage with her audience on Facebook, noting that her last performance review indicated that she was \"often exceeding expectations in the way she embodies [the station's] core values.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shooting that cost her her job, the Post notes, has not yet been solved.

Which means the last 48 or so hours have been spent reacclimating to real life and attempting to rid myself of the remnants of cruise culture. I have to keep reminding myself that I won't be eating 17 full meals a day anymore, I won't watch the same 60 people (my fiancee included) do the Wobble on the deck after lunch, and I won't be urged to attend events with names like \"The Captain's Dinner\" and \"The Captain's Pre-Dinner Reception\" and \"The Captain's Post-Dinner Speech on Police Brutality and The World Cup\" and \"The Captain's Midnight Deck Viewing of Carlito's Way.\"\n\nI also won't end each day in a cruise ship nightclub, watching in awe as Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy\" easily maintains the crown as 2014's \"Song Most Likely to Make Everyone Stop Whatever the Hell They're Doing and Rush to the Dance Floor.\"\n\nAdmittedly, the usual demographic makeup of this club (a close to 50/50 Black/White split most nights) was a bit different than the type of clubs I usually frequent. Basically, I don't know how well this song would play in a mostly Black club. But even I, a person who's had more than one conversation about the awkwardness of a White girl from Australia mimicking the vocal patterns and affectations of a Black female rapper from the South, found myself nodding my head when it came on. And \"Who dat? Who dat?/It be I-G-G-Y\" has been stuck in my head for the last five days, like an appropriating hipster parrot has gentrified my brain.\n\nThe popularity of Azalea's \"Fancy\" has arguably been hip-hop's biggest story this summer. Publications have crowned her hip-hop's newest star. Other publications have scoffed their noses at that suggestion. Nicki Minaj publicly called her out last week, with words maybe 1/100th as biting as the ones the hip-hop heads and \"race people\" on my Facebook newsfeed and Twitter timeline use when talking about her.\n\nWhen coupled with Macklemore's Grammy victories and the fact that the two most relevant male R&B artists today are Britney Spears' old boyfriend and Paula Patton's new stalker, it's easy to get the feeling that this is it. That this is the year when White artists finally complete their Black music coup d'etat. That soon enough, the only new Black music you'll hear from an actual Black person will be from Brian Pumper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we all need to relax.\n\nRegardless of how you contextualize their popularity and the reasons for it, it can't be denied that Macklemore, Thicke, and Azalea are legitimately popular. But\u2026this is not a bad thing. It's not a good thing either. It's just a thing. As long as traditionally Black music has existed in America, there have been White artists who've built careers off of it. Some have (obviously) been more well-received than others. And some make shitty music. But the angst over a White artist's popularity in this space minimizes the ubiquity and amorphousness of hip-hop culture. This isn't a redeveloped apartment complex with only 10 available slots for low-income renters. It's pervasive enough that Azalea and Angel Haze could be popular at the same time. Even if you don't care for Azalea's and Macklemore's music, there's enough space in hip-hop for them to exist without being a threat to anything or anyone. Because hip-hop is big as fuck. So big that there's space for White visitors. Even rude ones with shitty potato salad.\n\nAlso, this is the year when hip-hop had it's first billionaire (Dr. Dre) and first billion-dollar couple (Jay Z and Beyonce). All Black people. As is the person many consider the most important person in music today (Kanye West). And the country's hottest rapper (Drake). And the person who happens to be the most successful female rapper ever (Nicki Minaj). And the most prominent and potential-filled rising star (Kendrick Lamar). And the guys who still create all the street/hood anthems (Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, T.I., etc). And Diddy's Black ass. Thinking hip-hop is dominated by White artists is like thinking tigers are running the streets cause you saw one at the zoo. (That analogy made much more sense in my head, but you get my point.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first time the cruise club DJ played \"Fancy\", he followed it with a track whose baseline I immediately recognized. Everyone else did too, as those on the dance floor reflexively nodded their heads. They were only half-nods though, as most stopped as soon as the actual song that was playing finally dawned on them: Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby.\" Some completely left the dance floor. I even caught one White person angrily mouth \"WTF?\" at the DJ. I went back to my room a few minutes later.\n\nIf you're looking for a moral or meaning to this story, stop. There is none.

It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows?

Of course, seeing Wakanda brought up a lot of questions: What\u2019s the deal with those sand-like 3D display systems they have? How do they make such good holographic images come out of stylish bracelets? How fast do those mag-lev trains go? And, perhaps most importantly, what are Wakandan cars like?\n\n\n\nOh, I guess I should mention there will likely be some kind of spoilers here, so, you know, I\u2019m warning you now. Here be spoilers. Run.\n\nNow, while we saw a number of very impressive Wakandan transportation machines: aircraft (possibly spacecraft as well?), mag-lev trains, what looked like a nice light-rail system, we never actually saw any Wakandan rolling, car-like automobiles. Perhaps their cities are designed to not require them, or perhaps they prefer mass-transit and air travel culturally; I\u2019m not really sure. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing some speculation about what a Wakandan car could be.\n\nI\u2019m actually thinking of a very specific kind of Wakandan car: a Wakandan export-market car. I\u2019m taking as a jumping-off point the events at the end of the movie, where Wakanda is finally abandoning their centuries-long self-imposed isolation from the world and will now become part of the global community, an act which will include the desemination of advanced Wakandan technology to the world, at least to some degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandan technology is based on the (again, sadly) fictional element known as Vibranium, of which Wakanda has an incredibly supply of, thanks to a massive meteorite of the stuff buried beneath the country. We see vibranium powering things like Black Panther\u2019s suit, for example, and it\u2019s clearly capable of some incredible things, which is why it\u2019s so incredibly valuable.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Wakandans will try to immediately upgrade the entire planet to the level of technology they enjoy; that would be a colossal undertaking, and not only am I not sure that makes sense for Wakanda, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even possible. What I do think will happen is that Wakanda will produce products for global consumption that, while largely similar to existing global technology, and as such are understandable and will work with current global infrastructure, will incorporate some amount of advanced Wakandan vibranum-based tech to make them better in some dramatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the Wakandan car will be like: it\u2019ll be essentially recognizable as a car, in that it will have wheels that can use tires you can buy from any local tire store and you\u2019ll drive it and use it in essentially the same way we use cars now, but it will have a huge vibranium-related advantage. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m imagining this first Wakandan export market car, the Wakanda Motors Ingwe (that\u2019s Xhosa for \u2018panther\u2019 or \u2018puma\u2019) , will be:\n\nIt\u2019ll be a hybrid, fundamentally. But with a very crucial difference. Where the hybrids the rest of the world builds rely on heavy, inefficient chemical storage batteries, the Wakandan car will use the remarkable energy-absorbing and releasing power of vibranium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this power in action in Black Panther\u2019s suit, which has vibranium fibers woven into it. Black Panther gets shot with a bullet, for example, but instead of peeing himself and dying like most of us would, the suit not only stops the bullet, but absorbs the considerable kinetic energy from the bullet, stores it, and later releases it when Black Panther wants to do something like punch a truck through a building.\n\nThe WM Ingwe would use this kinetic energy-storage and release property of vibranium to replace the heavy batteries of a hybrid. By building the cars with an alloy of aluminum and vibranium for the main parts of the frame, and perhaps some of the main body panels, the Wakandan car would have a structure that\u2019s not just light and incredibly strong, but capable of storing vast amounts of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause vibranium has so far only been shown as something that can store and release energy, not generate it, we\u2019d still need to provide some initial source energy into the system. It may be possible to set up some sort of \u2018charging stations\u2019 which input energy into the vibranium frame of the car, allowing for a purely electric vehicle, but I was thinking it might be more useful for these cars to use a small internal combustion engine to act as an initial source of energy; It could be a fairly small motor, one liter or less, maybe something equivalent to one of the small three-cylinder motors being built by Ford, GM, Mitsubishi, BMW, whoever.\n\nMaybe this part will be sourced outside of Wakanda, or maybe some Wakandan researchers will have fun developing a tiny, powerful ICE engine of their own. It doesn\u2019t really matter. My guess is it would be a better PR move if they partnered with local companies to produce this part of the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, probably the best move to keep from overly disrupting the global economy would be for them to just license the fundamental technology and provide the needed vibranium to companies all over the world. In that sense, think of the WM Ingwe as a sort of low-volume reference vehicle, with versions of the basic tech produced by established carmakers, under license.)\n\nThe ICE motor would get things started, turning gasoline or diesel into kinetic energy that would start \u2018charging\u2019 the vibranium frame, which would then provide power output to the main electric motor driving the rear axles. Let\u2019s say this is a Wakandan-designed motor, a scaled-down version of what they\u2019re already making for their trains or mining equipment or hover-ship windshield wipers. Based on their technological prowess with this stuff, I imagine this could be a pretty potent motor, certainly comparable to what Teslas use. Let\u2019s say it can produce a peak horsepower of 500, because why not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce in motion, the vibranium frame and body panels are collecting every bit of kinetic energy they encounter\u2014the molecules of air that hit the body of the car will transfer their kinetic energy to the system, the vibrations of the road, the motions of the passengers inside, along with more traditional energy reclamation systems like regenerative braking.\n\nHell, if the car was sitting for a while, and you forgot to put fuel in the ICE motor, you could probably get a good 10 or 20 miles of range by just pounding on the hood with your fists for a few minutes.\n\nVibranium has been shown to be incredibly effective at harvesting ambient kinetic energy; a few minutes of ICE-assisted driving would likely be enough to charge the vibranium up to the point where you could travel for 200 to 300 miles before needing to restart the gas engine\u2014perhaps more if it was windy, or if you, say, got caught in a rainstorm, with each raindrop adding a nice burst of energy to the car as it impacted the vibranium-alloy roof and hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you\u2019d have, essentially, is a hybrid car without the biggest disadvantage of a hybrid: the heavy, inefficient battery. The vibranium frame and body panels would be both an incredibly strong and safe structure for the car as well as all the energy storage the car needs. You could shave hundreds and hundreds of pounds from cars, eliminate the difficult and environmentally troubling mining of resources like lithium, and never worry about finding a charging station or if your battery pack is going to degrade to uselessness after 10 years.\n\nWith a car like this, the Wakandans could make every Prius (and likely Tesla) on the road obsolete overnight. Wakandan vibranium technology has the potential to make incredibly efficient automobiles without sacrificing range or performance. I can\u2019t wait until we start seeing these things on the market\u2014you\u2019d have to be an idiot to buy anything that didn\u2019t use Wakandan vibranium-based tech.\n\nOh, shit, right.

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of.

The police were called to the scene after being \u201calerted to an actor with a gun.\u201d But Anita Williams, Mark Daniels\u2019 aunt, claimed that her nephew did not own or carry a gun. She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["natural", "having", "friend", "designer", "hero", "panthers", "camille", "really", "movie", "traditional", "teamsupernatural", "black", "panther", "meet", "hair", "think"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["women", "stem", "math", "leadership", "takes", "world", "raise", "work", "jessie", "young", "need", "shuris", "girls", "black", "woolleywilson", "tech"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["theres", "situation", "right", "child", "family", "gaines", "korryn", "hes", "speaks", "lives", "wont", "mothers", "baltimore", "mother", "dormeus", "rest", "pain"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

She and her husband, Jamal, planned three parties over one weekend and had $43,000 in cash on hand that her husband was taking to the bank around 11 a.m. As Jamal stopped to talk to his friends, Baltimore City Sgt. Wayne Jenkins and his partner pulled up and searched his car.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey find a small bag of marijuana, but that\u2019s a lie. But they use it as an opportunity to arrest him,\u201d defense attorney Ivan Bates told The Root. \u201cThey submit $23,000 and keep $20,000 for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bates, this was a regular tactic used by Baltimore City police to get the addresses of people whom they considered high rollers because they had expensive cars.\n\n\n\nThey then went to Jovonne Walker\u2019s house and tried to break in. Jovonne was so frightened that she pushed the silent alarm button. According to Bates, a new set of officers showed up in response to the alarm, but Jenkins and his partner said that they would handle it. They searched the house without a warrant, saying that Jovonne agreed to let them search. They later went back and obtained a warrant. They found two guns that Jovonne owned, and charged her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the aftermath of their arrests, the couple almost lost their house. Jamal, who worked as an electrician, wasn\u2019t able to get some clearances to work. One of their cars was repossessed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have your life turned upside down for almost two years, to not be able to work in a field that you\u2019re passionate about because you have pending charges. Fearing for my kids\u2019 life because someone was trying to get into our home. It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner. It\u2019s gonna take a while to change the culture. But you have to prosecute the officers that are doing it and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["jovonne", "pieces", "drugs", "house", "stole", "abuse", "jenkins", "gun", "officers", "baltimore", "sold", "city", "killings", "bates", "covered", "say", "pick"], "polarity": 0.020850306342109614, "subjectivity": 0.40127510922592896},

Jordan. The exploits of the movie\u2019s title hero (Chadwick Boseman) and various members of his team are also throughly, lovingly captured by director and co-writer Ryan Coogler. But something does happen whenever the movie cuts over to Jordan\u2019s Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d Stevens: The scenes snap Coogler, and by extension his audience, out of the usual Marvel Cinematic Universe reverie of affection and amusement, bringing them to sharper attention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be unique to an MCU project, but it\u2019s not that unusual for Coogler\u2019s films, in part because he\u2019s a terrific filmmaker, and maybe also because all three of them\u2014Black Panther, Creed, and Fruitvale Station\u2014feature Jordan. It\u2019s not just a case of the camera loving Jordan, though he does have some of that innate star quality. Coogler seems especially fascinated by the actor\u2019s confidence\u2014his lack of obvious attempts to ingratiate himself\u2014and how that can transform the material he\u2019s given.\n\nAnd Jordan does help transform his material. None of his movies with Coogler are exactly unpredictable in terms of pure plot. This is even true of the groundbreaking Black Panther. On paper, Jordan\u2019s Erik follows an arc familiar to the MCU: He shares a semi-secret history with the film\u2019s costumed protagonist, spends his early scenes isolated from the other main characters as he gathers his resources and prepares to surprise the hero, and is pitted against that hero in a battle in which he functions as a mirror image, even donning his own panther-like supersuit.\n\nYet by handing this Marvel boilerplate over to Jordan, Coogler turns a well-worn structure into an affecting strategy. Erik\u2019s backstory, revealed well into the film, depends on his being left behind by the futuristic but closed-off country of Wakanda, abandoned in Coogler\u2019s hometown of Oakland following the death of his revolutionary father. He\u2019s one of the weightiest MCU villains, but Jordan doesn\u2019t charge straight into operatic intensity or even normal scenery-chewing. While most of the Wakanda characters speak in African-accented English that sounds regal and precise, Erik has a more colloquial American style, in which Jordan finds a wry musicality. His understated greeting of \u201cHey, auntie,\u201d directed at Wakandan royalty Ramonda (Angela Bassett), has a cultural specificity lacking from the MCU\u2019s easier laugh lines, and a human dimension sorely lacking from, say, the Red Skull. Jordan\u2019s performance depends on these small gestures, like when Erik addresses his Wakandan associates from the throne and taps his finger to betray a nervous energy behind his authority. Most supervillain performances play, with an understandable theatricality, to the audience. Jordan\u2019s speech patterns and little gestures are more self-possessed.\n\nPhoto: Black Panther (Marvel Studios/Disney)\n\nCoogler uses his gift for imagery to support Jordan\u2019s actorly choices, like the scene in which Erik approaches the Wakanda border with a crucial dead body in tow. This brief moment has a texture often lacking in comics movies, a kind of magic-hour idyll that nonetheless depicts an angry revolutionary carting around a corpse. Coogler also employs one of his favorite cinematic devices, the following shot, in which the camera pursues its subject. Killmonger isn\u2019t the only one who gets this treatment; Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa has one of his own as he approaches his crowning ceremony. But the most striking version in the movie stays on Killmonger\u2019s back, not Black Panther\u2019s. As Erik assumes the Wakandan throne, the camera begins upside down and makes a full, deliberate 180-degree turn, both a stylish image and a crystallization of the moment when Killmonger transitions from angry outsider to the man in charge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan\u2019s willingness to be still, and explode with emotion when needed, seem to embolden Coogler\u2019s nervier instincts. This was the case before Black Panther, when Coogler made another franchise movie that gave him even more stylistic flexibility. Creed, in which Jordan plays the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent-turned-buddy Apollo Creed, isn\u2019t building an expansion on an expensive, elaborate, ongoing piece of Marvel architecture, but working off of a series bible written mostly (and haphazardly) by Rocky star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. This allows Coogler and Jordan to reshape the material and make the best Rocky movie since the first one.\n\nCreed doesn\u2019t give Jordan a lot of dialogue upfront. Adonis Creed\u2019s first lines in the movie are spoken by an actor playing him as a kid, and he\u2019s first seen as an adult getting himself psyched up for a fight before the camera follows him up some stairs, mostly in shadow, and into the boxing ring. Other early scenes, all providing the character with degrees of standoffishness, rely on his seething intensity\u2014and accompanying sense of isolation. Even his first conversation with his love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), gets abruptly curtailed as she slams a door in his face.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat, subtle trick Coogler plays to maintain Creed\u2019s underdog status despite what appears to be a more privileged background than Balboa. The fact that Jordan\u2019s ultra-persistent Creed doesn\u2019t replicate the aw-shucks humility of Rocky counts as a bold gambit in a big-studio environment that demands selfless gestures, cardboard villains, children in peril\u2026 anything to score some more precious likability. Creed works so well because Jordan spends so little time asking for approval, which gives his late-movie mid-fight admission to Balboa, that he\u2019s fighting to prove that he\u2019s not a \u201cmistake,\u201d the force of a major body blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Creed\u2019s boxing legacy, the movie succeeds in keeping its characters at ground level, which Coogler emphasizes with more following shots. Some of them have a traditional boxer-into-the-ring iconic grandeur, while others, like Creed\u2019s entrance into Bianca\u2019s apartment, are more intimate, bringing the audience along with the character rather than staring in awe at his majesty. There\u2019s a similar sense of intimacy in the sequence when Coogler follows Jordan and Stallone together from a Philadelphia street, up some stairs, and around the floor of a boxing gym, simply because after a lot of scenes that isolate Jordan, the two stars share the frame for nearly the entire length of the unbroken shot.\n\nAlthough both Creed and Panther have a broader visual vocabulary, it\u2019s their following shots that forge the strongest visual connections between the earliest, least flashy Coogler/Jordan collaboration. Fruitvale Station, a dramatization of the 24 hours leading up to the real-life police shooting of Oscar Grant III, an unarmed Bay Area resident, packs a clear emotional punch, and its relevance sadly hasn\u2019t faded at all since its 2013 release. In the context of Coogler\u2019s career, though, it feels like an extremely promising tryout. Plenty of filmmakers\u2014hopefully most\u2014improve after their first film, but it\u2019s rare to find a director who can follow a Sundance indie with two straight franchise movies and have the franchise movies feel more personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Fruitvale, Coogler and Jordan haven\u2019t come to experiment or dazzle. Stylewise, the movie stays within contemporary American indie aesthetics, with lots of handheld camera and plainspoken realism (sort of Gus Van Sant lite). Jordan talks more, with a slightly Casey Affleck-ish rasp, and spells out more of his character\u2019s feelings. Most of the movie\u2019s stylistic flourishes are accordingly less sustained, part of its slice-of-life approach: Coogler\u2019s camera follows Oscar into his bedroom as he hastily cleans up and grabs some marijuana that he intends to sell; down the greeting card aisle of a store; and with handheld jitteriness as he approaches the canine victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nBut there are also distinctive if still unshowy stretches: one following shot of Oscar as he walks through his daughter\u2019s school, leading seamlessly into a brief scene with his daughter on the school\u2019s backyard playground, and another that travels with him and his friends up the escalator out of the BART system and onto the streets of San Francisco. The camera isn\u2019t constantly at Jordan\u2019s back but it scarcely lets him out of its sight\u2014a queasily effective strategy given Oscar\u2019s tragic end.\n\nThat coiled quality of waiting for a vicious inevitability lies more with the story of Fruitvale than Jordan\u2019s performance; the real-life events take over and can\u2019t provide the emotional release of an extremely fictional crowd-pleaser like Black Panther or Creed. But Jordan does get to show tremendous range of the everyday-life variety: warmth with his daughter, frustration with his limited job options, guilt over lying to his mom about using a cellphone earpiece while he drives, sly charm in a scene where he talks a shop owner into letting a couple of women in to use the bathroom. That this character\u2019s reality extends to a terrifying and violent police stop makes the movie chilling, and Jordan keeps it from feeling too much like a pure exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is in almost every single scene of Fruitvale, most of the scenes in Creed, and comparatively fewer in Black Panther. This progression would make it seem like Coogler is weaning himself off of his muse, if not for the fact that Jordan\u2019s potency only increases as their collaboration goes on. He commands the screen in Fruitvale, emerges as a real movie star in Creed, and by Black Panther does so much with his half hour or so of screen time that his presence looms over the whole movie despite barely appearing in it for the first hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the single most affecting scene of Black Panther, Coogler holds back his star, trusting him to deliver in small doses. During a dream sequence, Erik speaks to his departed father (Sterling K. Brown), and in a single cut, Coogler brings Erik back to the pre-teen age he was when his dad was killed. Their interaction continues without missing a beat, and when he cuts back to the adult Erik, still in the dream, a tear streaming down Jordan\u2019s cheek, the scared, angry kid of seconds earlier is still there in Jordan\u2019s eyes. Inserting a kid actor into the scene could come off like a filmmaking shortcut, a way to wring emotion out of the scene faster. But it works beautifully because Coogler trusts Jordan to create continuity with those shots of his character\u2019s younger self. The scene has a recognizably real-world sense of tragedy with few, if any, equals in the MCU.\n\nThis carries over into the film\u2019s action climax. As they fight for Wakanda\u2019s fate, Erik and T\u2019Challa are forcefully separated by a vibranium-powered subway that temporarily de-powers their supersuits (Star Wars diehards may recall a similar physical setup in a Phantom Menace duel). Coogler uses the strategic halt in action as an opportunity for Erik to expose his pain, his sense that the world has taken everything from him, an outburst not unlike Creed\u2019s moment of ringside catharsis. Excitingly staged fisticuffs pause for sustained heartbreak. Black Panther has some Marvel limitations, but Coogler seems excited to readjust pop touchstones while pushing Jordan to the fore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan and Coogler are both extremely talented, and will doubtlessly do great work apart. (A fourth collaboration between the two, the test-cheating drama Wrong Answer, has already been announced). Their work together so far, though, feels emboldened like the best star/filmmaker collaborations. In this case, Jordan and Coogler have been able to address aspects of being black in America in all of their movies in pretty disparate genres. Other filmmakers have treated Jordan like a more traditional star. In his movies without Coogler, including two other superhero pictures from now-disgraced director Josh Trank (the found-footage Chronicle and the most recent attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four), he\u2019s still charismatic. But his material leans heavily on that charisma, rather than pushing it beyond movie-star likability. Chronicle seems to at least understand his magnetism, but Fantastic Four strands him and the rest of the cast, while his single foray into comedy, That Awkward Moment, burdens him with the movie\u2019s most serious subplot (though he\u2019s not any worse off than the cast members who have to labor under the impression that their antics are amusing).\n\nAs Jordan becomes more famous, presumably other filmmakers will figure out how to use him more effectively and consistently. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine another director matching the thrill of Coogler and Jordan getting on each other\u2019s wavelength, modulating big stylistic leaps with subtler performance notes (and, when necessary, vice versa), digging beyond the surface pleasures of their talents. Their collective gravity brings even the biggest movies down to earth.", "keywords": ["erik", "goes", "movies", "partnership", "ryan", "b", "movie", "gameraising", "creed", "michael", "scene", "jordan", "black", "panther", "jordans", "coogler"], "polarity": 0.09555645743145742, "subjectivity": 0.4853012265512266},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["riots", "tchalla", "history", "help", "folks", "cant", "black", "killmonger", "panther", "wanted", "know", "revisionist", "njobu"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

Ain\u2019t gonna tear up my cars.\u201d\n\nShoupe was not part of the slow-speed chase that spanned two counties, but he arrived on scene shortly after his officers fired the deadly shots, which was when his comments were recorded.\n\n\u201cI love this shit,\u201d he continues. \u201cGod, I tell you what, I thrive on it. If they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker, they\u2019re full of shit. Take him out. I\u2019m here on the damn wrong end of the county.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaughter can be heard as the sheriff makes his comments.\n\nThe incident began last April when Smithville, Tenn., police tried to pull Dial over for driving on a suspended license. At the time, he was driving a 1976 pickup with a fully loaded trailer being pulled at the back. The chase started in DeKalb County before crossing over into White County, where White County deputies took over the chase.\n\nDial\u2019s wife, Robyn, says she is still not sure how the situation escalated so quickly, leading to the death of her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop?\u201d Robyn Dial said. \u201cHe was scared. I know him enough to know that.\u201d\n\nThe chase never reached high speeds. DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["shoot", "county", "ordering", "chase", "slowspeed", "dial", "tennessee", "dont", "unarmed", "told", "white", "officers", "deputies", "recorded", "sheriff", "shoupe", "west", "shit", "man"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet. Plus, Queen Latifah is a curvy woman, so I felt like she rocked styles that would also work for me. I imagined that her wardrobe of tailored suits with the colorful vests underneath would fit me perfectly!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI spent most of the \u201980s tuned into pop, vintage soul and hair bands, with most hip-hop on my periphery. But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans. I wanted to wear my hair in braids and sport baseball caps and bubble coats or Starter jackets. I couldn\u2019t buy Air Force 1s, but I spent a lot of time just drooling over them in Foot Locker.\n\nWhen Higher Learning hit theaters in 1995, I had my first real date with a woman. I\u2019d had a girlfriend years before, but we were so closeted we moved through our own internalized homophobia as \u201cbest friends.\u201d Higher Learning helped evolve not only my political consciousness but also my sense of style. I envied Busta\u2019s dreads (my hair could never do that) and may not have had Cube\u2019s Chucks, but seeing both of them on-screen helped push my relationship with my gender expression forward.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the film Set It Off premiered a year later, I\u2019d just finished reading the classic novel Stone Butch Blues, by the late Leslie Feinberg. I was finally attempting to figure out my gender expression and how I wanted to present to the world. Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["shaped", "living", "women", "love", "hiphop", "butch", "style", "jones", "single", "latifah", "id", "felt", "way", "90s", "wanted"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

Erik Killmonger:\n\na) Is a well-rounded antagonist who inspires sympathy while still playing the villain.\n\nb) Needs to put some shea butter on those chicken pox bumps.\n\nc) Wouldn\u2019t have been so angry if he had been invited to the family reunion and met his cousins a long time ago.\n\nd) Is a revolutionary Pan-Africanist who wants to free his people by any means necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6.

Can\u2019t you see you come from kings and queens? My people perish for a lack of knowledge.\n\n71-99: You are woke AF. You use your third eye to overstand the white supremacist structure and would consider going vegan if it weren\u2019t for the fact that you love pork chops and your white girlfriend can fry the fuck outta some bacon.\n\n100 and above: You are too woke. Instead of polluting your mind with movies about fictional superheroes, you\u2019d rather read about real-life things like how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention injected us with AIDS and fills our television programs with subliminal messages that turn us into transsexuals.

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain. The investigation revealed no evidence to refute Officer Carelli\u2019s testimony that he shot Mr. Chamberlain in response to his belief that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously physically injured by Mr. Chamberlain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the Justice Department\u2019s reason for closing the case. Because it is OK to shoot someone as long as\u2014despite all the evidence to the contrary\u2014you believe that he or she poses a danger, you can murder that person in cold blood.

The redevelopment has been so dramatic, the name of the neighborhood has changed. Some now call it Eastside\u2014a colonizing portmanteau of East Liberty and the neighboring (and predominantly white) Shadyside.\n\nThis is also where I grew up. And the East Liberty of the early and mid-\u201990s was a vastly different place than it is today. From 1989 to 1995, my parents and I lived on the 700 block of Mellon Street, perhaps the hottest stretch in what was then a crime- and gang-infested neighborhood. I\u2019ve seen it all\u2014drive-bys, crack, stabbings, shootings, murders. My mom was even shot while sleeping in her bed by a drug dealer who mistook our house for a rival\u2019s and shot through our windows. (The bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her wrist.)\n\nBasically, I know what it means to live in the hood because, well, I\u2019ve lived in the hood. And I also know that misinformation about living in the hood is pervasive, existing everywhere from news articles and TV shows about it to the conversations that people not from it have about it. Some of these inaccurate presumptions and outright lies are a bit more popular\u2014and a bit more dangerous\u2014than the rest. Here are 10:\n\n1. Kids who are smart are teased and bullied for \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, this experience is/was, in fact, the reality for many kids from the hood. I don\u2019t want to pretend as if these things didn\u2019t happen to them. But that experience is often thought of as the norm, when it\u2019s more of the exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, teasing and bullying might happen, because teasing and bullying happen everywhere. But if you\u2019re a kid in the hood who has some sort of academic/intellectual talent, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll have people in the neighborhood supporting and protecting you than trying to beat the \u201cwhiteness\u201d out of you.\n\n2. People in the hood face constant pressure from drug dealers and/or gang members to join them.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure there are many people who were, in fact, pressured to join gangs and/or hustle. But the idea of every hood being overrun by aggressive dopeboys threatening everyone to be down just ain\u2019t true. If anything, they\u2019re mostly nonchalant about it, like, \u201cIf you wanna be down, fine. If not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keeping with this theme ...\n\n3. All drug dealers have money.\n\nOf course, there are some who do quite well financially. But there are many others\u2014so many others\u2014who\u2019d be making considerably more money at Home Depot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Most young people don\u2019t make it past 21.\n\nI\u2019ve always been annoyed at the idea that kids from the hood are lucky to make it to 21. While the murder rates are definitely dangerously and depressingly high in many neighborhoods, it\u2019s not like 75 percent. Most people from the hood make it to 21. And 31. And 41. And 51. (But not 61, because stress.)\n\n5. You must know how to fight because that\u2019s the only way you would\u2019ve been able to survive.\n\nEh, no.\n\nOf course, being able to handle yourself is a valuable skill to have. But you know what\u2019s more valuable? Walking and looking like you know how to handle yourself. And being hyperaware of your surroundings so you know how to avoid situations where you\u2019d be forced to handle yourself. And having friends or family who can handle themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso ...\n\n6. If you want to avoid the trappings of the hood, you should probably stay in the house as much as possible.\n\nPerhaps this was/is a good strategy for some people. But in my experience, the best way to avoid finding trouble was staying busy with activities. Sports, school, art, work, whatever. Of the people I knew who got caught up, the main thing that caught them was sheer boredom. They spent all of their time on the block because they didn\u2019t have shit else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There are no middle-class families in the hood.\n\nUntrue. Because of structural racism and historical restrictions on where black people were/are able to rent and buy property (and there have been numerous studies proving this), it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to find people with middle-class incomes in those neighborhoods.\n\n8. There are no nuclear families in the hood.\n\nYes, there are actually nuclear families in the hood. This means that there are actually black children who happen to live in the hood and under the same roof as their dads\u2014who also happen to be married to their moms. Crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Poor black parents don\u2019t care about their children.\n\nOne of the most common ways this \u201ctruth\u201d is articulated is through parent-teacher conferences. Basically, that in more affluent (read: white) neighborhoods, parents are so hyperinvolved that teachers have to make specific schedules to accommodate all of the parents interested in meeting with them. Whereas teachers in the hood are lucky to speak to/meet one parent\u2014which is seen as an obvious sign of disinterest and/or neglect.\n\nThe reality, however, is more complicated. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t able to take off work and attend. Sometimes the parent hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with schools and teachers, and sincerely believes their child would fare better without their involvement. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t aware that the parent-teacher conferences are happening because the school didn\u2019t bother sending any notices to them. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous to believe that lack of income somehow correlates to lack of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. People in the hood are controlled by a constant fear of violence.\n\nOf course, violence exists. It destroys lives, rips apart families and can, in some cases, create a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder. Violence fucking sucks.\n\nBut while violence is a reality, it doesn\u2019t prevent the entire hood from leaving the house. Or from hanging out on the corner. Or from being neighborly and friendly. Or from attending and perhaps even throwing block parties. Even the hottest blocks will have kids double-Dutching and playing touch-tab football on them. You might even find some old heads laughing and drinking tea on a porch. Maybe you\u2019d assume they were celebrating making it past 21. But they probably just want to talk to one another about 401(k)s.", "keywords": ["misconceptions", "stop", "handle", "parents", "lies", "need", "believing", "families", "spreading", "happen", "hood", "east", "know", "neighborhood", "course", "kids"], "polarity": 0.14255499438832772, "subjectivity": 0.48307671957671966},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["styles", "images", "love", "veronica", "wear", "style", "getty", "wanna", "look", "black", "fashion", "marvel", "film", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

It was fairly windy, so maybe a gust had set off the car alarm, though no sound was coming from the car.\n\nThe car was parked in the driveway of the home, the outdoor Christmas lights were on and I could see that a light on the top floor was on, so I assumed that somebody was home. I thought to myself, \u201cI should hop out of the car and go ring their doorbell and let them know that their car lights are on.\u201d Lord knows, I\u2019d hate to wake up in the morning\u2014it was about 8 p.m. when I saw the car\u2014and find out my car battery was dead because the alarm was going off all night.\n\nI almost pulled up to the house right then, but I decided to drop off my daughter first. Should something go awry, I do not want my daughter there.\n\nShould something go awry.\n\nThat\u2019s literally the first thought that popped into my head. I wanted to let this family know that their car alarm was going off and that they might want to go see about it, and I was worried about what could go wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI dropped off my daughter at her mother\u2019s home, which is farther into the subdivision, so I\u2019d pass the house on my way back out. I told myself that if the alarm was still going off when I drove by again\u2014likely\u2014that I\u2019d get out and go ring their doorbell and let them know. It seemed like such a simple and neighborly thing to do. And here was where all of the true overthinking began.\n\nI pulled up to the side of the house and started to plan how I was going to go about telling them. For one, I had on all black, save for my maroon down jacket, with a black hoodie and black skullcap. It was about 15 degrees outside, so I wasn\u2019t taking any of that off and risking getting myself sick in order to let them know their car lights were blinking.\n\nThen I thought to myself, \u201cIf I go up to this door and ring the doorbell and wait, chances are they\u2019ll turn the light on so they\u2019ll be able to see me, but I\u2019m dressed as I am, and because of the positioning of the garage, they won\u2019t actually be able to see their car from their front door, so they could be suspicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll just go ring the doorbell, walk back to my car quickly hoping that I beat them answering the door, maybe get into my car or stand there, and when they open the door, yell an entire concession speech about how I wanted to let them know about their car but didn\u2019t want to frighten them as a random stranger dressed in all black at their door at 8 p.m. on a really dark street\u201d\u2014seriously, this street needs streetlights in the worst way\u2014\u201cbut didn\u2019t want them to wake up to a car with a dead battery.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want them to think about having to step outside the door with me there and wondering if I was going to try to force myself into their home, so I walked away from the door.\n\nI was really thinking about saying all of that. Why?\n\nI did not want to end up shot or having the police called on me. Do I know if they had a gun? Or would have answered the door with one? No, I don\u2019t. But do I know that they wouldn\u2019t have? Nope. They didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know them and it was dark outside and late enough to wonder who would be stopping by the house unannounced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI literally had all of these thoughts as I sat there and tried to strategize how to do them a solid and put myself in the least amount of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAnd you know what I did? I drove off. I felt bad for driving off. But I also felt like I had to think too hard on how best to make them feel comfortable as I tried to help them out, and how my trying to be nice required me to consider so many factors about myself and how I would present at the door.\n\nIt\u2019s ENTIRELY possible that I totally overthought the whole thing. Maybe I watch too much television or read too much\u2014a police officer told me that once when he pulled me over and I very slowly and deliberately told him what I was doing as I grabbed my wallet. I was pissed that he\u2019d mocked me when I was trying to make sure I made it home safely and he didn\u2019t shoot anybody that night because he feared for his life over a taillight in front of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Union Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recognize there was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about walking up to somebody\u2019s door, and if it had been summer and more well-lit outside, I would have without a second thought. But I\u2019ve read too many stories of trivial encounters gone all the way wrong. And I could see all the ways it could have happened in the few minutes I sat there pondering how I\u2019d do this. And it wasn\u2019t lost on me that, ultimately, I had to strategize a good deed so that this one did not go punished.\n\nUnder different circumstances, I\u2019d absolutely walk up to a door and alert somebody. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve done it in my own neighborhood\u2014one where I\u2019d think people would be more hyperaware of people coming to their door.\n\nChances are, even last night, nothing would have happened to me. I\u2019d have let them know, they\u2019d have checked out their car, thanked me and turned off the alarm, and we\u2019d all have gone about our lives. But I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who lived there or what they\u2019ve gone through in life. Or what they\u2019ve seen. Or if it was a cop who is always on high alert, or whatever.

The redevelopment has been so dramatic, the name of the neighborhood has changed. Some now call it Eastside\u2014a colonizing portmanteau of East Liberty and the neighboring (and predominantly white) Shadyside.\n\nThis is also where I grew up. And the East Liberty of the early and mid-\u201990s was a vastly different place than it is today. From 1989 to 1995, my parents and I lived on the 700 block of Mellon Street, perhaps the hottest stretch in what was then a crime- and gang-infested neighborhood. I\u2019ve seen it all\u2014drive-bys, crack, stabbings, shootings, murders. My mom was even shot while sleeping in her bed by a drug dealer who mistook our house for a rival\u2019s and shot through our windows. (The bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her wrist.)\n\nBasically, I know what it means to live in the hood because, well, I\u2019ve lived in the hood. And I also know that misinformation about living in the hood is pervasive, existing everywhere from news articles and TV shows about it to the conversations that people not from it have about it. Some of these inaccurate presumptions and outright lies are a bit more popular\u2014and a bit more dangerous\u2014than the rest. Here are 10:\n\n1. Kids who are smart are teased and bullied for \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, this experience is/was, in fact, the reality for many kids from the hood. I don\u2019t want to pretend as if these things didn\u2019t happen to them. But that experience is often thought of as the norm, when it\u2019s more of the exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, teasing and bullying might happen, because teasing and bullying happen everywhere. But if you\u2019re a kid in the hood who has some sort of academic/intellectual talent, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll have people in the neighborhood supporting and protecting you than trying to beat the \u201cwhiteness\u201d out of you.\n\n2. People in the hood face constant pressure from drug dealers and/or gang members to join them.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure there are many people who were, in fact, pressured to join gangs and/or hustle. But the idea of every hood being overrun by aggressive dopeboys threatening everyone to be down just ain\u2019t true. If anything, they\u2019re mostly nonchalant about it, like, \u201cIf you wanna be down, fine. If not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keeping with this theme ...\n\n3. All drug dealers have money.\n\nOf course, there are some who do quite well financially. But there are many others\u2014so many others\u2014who\u2019d be making considerably more money at Home Depot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Most young people don\u2019t make it past 21.\n\nI\u2019ve always been annoyed at the idea that kids from the hood are lucky to make it to 21. While the murder rates are definitely dangerously and depressingly high in many neighborhoods, it\u2019s not like 75 percent. Most people from the hood make it to 21. And 31. And 41. And 51. (But not 61, because stress.)\n\n5. You must know how to fight because that\u2019s the only way you would\u2019ve been able to survive.\n\nEh, no.\n\nOf course, being able to handle yourself is a valuable skill to have. But you know what\u2019s more valuable? Walking and looking like you know how to handle yourself. And being hyperaware of your surroundings so you know how to avoid situations where you\u2019d be forced to handle yourself. And having friends or family who can handle themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso ...\n\n6. If you want to avoid the trappings of the hood, you should probably stay in the house as much as possible.\n\nPerhaps this was/is a good strategy for some people. But in my experience, the best way to avoid finding trouble was staying busy with activities. Sports, school, art, work, whatever. Of the people I knew who got caught up, the main thing that caught them was sheer boredom. They spent all of their time on the block because they didn\u2019t have shit else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There are no middle-class families in the hood.\n\nUntrue. Because of structural racism and historical restrictions on where black people were/are able to rent and buy property (and there have been numerous studies proving this), it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to find people with middle-class incomes in those neighborhoods.\n\n8. There are no nuclear families in the hood.\n\nYes, there are actually nuclear families in the hood. This means that there are actually black children who happen to live in the hood and under the same roof as their dads\u2014who also happen to be married to their moms. Crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Poor black parents don\u2019t care about their children.\n\nOne of the most common ways this \u201ctruth\u201d is articulated is through parent-teacher conferences. Basically, that in more affluent (read: white) neighborhoods, parents are so hyperinvolved that teachers have to make specific schedules to accommodate all of the parents interested in meeting with them. Whereas teachers in the hood are lucky to speak to/meet one parent\u2014which is seen as an obvious sign of disinterest and/or neglect.\n\nThe reality, however, is more complicated. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t able to take off work and attend. Sometimes the parent hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with schools and teachers, and sincerely believes their child would fare better without their involvement. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t aware that the parent-teacher conferences are happening because the school didn\u2019t bother sending any notices to them. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous to believe that lack of income somehow correlates to lack of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. People in the hood are controlled by a constant fear of violence.\n\nOf course, violence exists. It destroys lives, rips apart families and can, in some cases, create a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder. Violence fucking sucks.\n\nBut while violence is a reality, it doesn\u2019t prevent the entire hood from leaving the house. Or from hanging out on the corner. Or from being neighborly and friendly. Or from attending and perhaps even throwing block parties. Even the hottest blocks will have kids double-Dutching and playing touch-tab football on them. You might even find some old heads laughing and drinking tea on a porch. Maybe you\u2019d assume they were celebrating making it past 21.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

There he would find no solace, no safety, no hope, and nowhere to tan.\n\nSensing that their dad was unmoved by their scare tactics, they called Kellyanne Conway. Who, after unsuccessfully attempting to convince the Trumps they actually called Pizza Hut and not her, grudgingly stopped updating her LinkedIn page and texted Donald, saying \u201cPlease don\u2019t be a fucking idiot. Or do. It\u2019s whatever. I really don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\n\nEven Melania eventually weighed in with a printed out powerpoint package of the dangers of the inner-city. Sure, the powerpoint was actually just an old Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church pamphlet, accidently left in their Maybach by their driver. Which explained why the Ebenezer emblem was crudely etched out, with \u201cLove Always, Melania\u201d superimposed on top of it. And also explained why bullets about the church fund and an upcoming potato salad potluck fundraiser and the need for prayer warriors for Sister Esther Johnson were included in her presentation. But, as always, her heart was in the right place. Bless Melania\u2019s heart, really. She, like everyone else, just wanted to protect her Donald.\n\nBut his mind was made up. He had grown tired of just talking about The Blacks and the dystopian hellscapes they existed in, of speaking of them in abstract terms. He\u2019d said enough during his campaign about the roving gangs on each block \u2014 marauding and murdering and raping and pillaging and even occasionally going to grocery stores to stand in the eight items or less aisle with like 17 items. He had no more words about the hundreds of thousands of The Blacks milling aimlessly about in the street, since there were literally zero jobs in the inner cities. And not even any streets or buildings. Or grass. Or ground. Just air. These Blacks just floated around all day like Black-ass balloons. He was fed up with the abject hopelessness plaguing The Blacks and even the elbowlessness of the thousands afflicted with the deadly strain of the flu that left entire communities of The Blacks without elbows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had to see for himself. He had to spend a day in the hood. By himself.\n\nFor his journey, he chose the darkest, deepest, and most dangerous part of the inner-city. Carrying only a musket and a canteen filled with milk, The Donald began at dawn, hoping to catch one of The Blacks in their natural habitat: napping or robbing a store of their entire stock of Cheetos.\n\n15 minutes into his walk, he heard footsteps approaching. Fast footsteps. Quick and rhythmic footsteps only an African American rapist could make.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPa-Pat. Pa-Pat. Pa-Pat. Pa-Pat. Pa-Pat. Pa-Pat.\n\nHe braced himself for a confrontation. \u201cThis\u201d he told himself \u201cis why I watched all those Crossfit DVDs on my iPad. I\u2019m ready.\u201d He turned to face the Black Beast. And was nearly bumped into the street by a young White woman in yoga pants and New Balance crosstrainers; who screamed \u201cStop hogging the damn sidewalk!\u201d as she sped by.\n\nDonald\u2019s adrenaline began to spike. \u201cShe\u2019s running from someone\u201d he thought to himself, stupidly. \u201cProbably The Blacks. Definitely The Blacks. The Blacks must be near.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe sat on the stoop of the nearest building to catch his breath and collect his thoughts. He\u2019d still seen nary a Black. No gangs. No guns. And definitely no mulattos. But he still was confident he would eventually.\n\nAs he sat, he felt the door behind him open. Slowly and cautiously, the old door creaked like an uncle getting out of a chair to do a chore he really doesn\u2019t want to do. The wind from the just-opened door hit Donald\u2019s neck, startling and scaring him. He felt the presumably African-American heat of the person who opened this door now standing behind him. And Donald sat paralyzed. \u201cThose clever African Americans\u201d he thought to himself, extra stupidly \u201cthey knew I\u2019d be here and waited to plan their attack. And I fell into their trap.\u201d\n\nHe knew this would be his last minute, his last seconds, as he felt the mysterious figure approaching, surely about to straight blast his mark ass. So he took a moment to reflect on his life; his regrets (none) his great loves (none) his most treasured friends (none) his good deeds (none) and the faces he\u2019d love to remember one last time (none but his own).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then the guy behind him \u2014- a Black, at last \u2014 offered him a free plate of muffin tops. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Raheem\u201d the Black said to a still stunned Donald, \u201cplease take these. I thought it was awesome you love our muffin tops so much that you\u2019d sit here in the cold and wait for us to open, so here\u2019s some free samples.\u201d\n\nConfused, Donald looked up at the storefront window. The sign on it read \u201cRaheem\u2019s House of Amazing and Delicious Muffin Tops.\u201d He looked back at Raheem, who was still smiling and offering presumably amazing and delicious muffin tops.\n\nWhat Donald hadn\u2019t yet realized was that the darkest, deepest, and most dangerous part of the inner-city was actually the darkest, deepest, and most dangerous part of the inner city\u2026in 1991. Which happened to be the last time Donald actually read a newspaper. Now it\u2019s just arbitrarily aggressive White women jogging and boutiques for useless and expensive food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, traversing the post-dawn block on the hunt for The African Americans made Donald quite hungry, so he took Raheem\u2019s offer and bit a muffin top. It was amazing and delicious, just like the sign said.\n\n\u201cWow Raheem! These are great!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr Trump.\"\n\n\"So, you just make whole muffins, cut the tops off of them, and sell them?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what we do here.\"\n\n\"And what do you do with the rest of the muffin.\"\n\n\"We donate them to a food bank.\"\n\n\"Well that's fantastic. The best thing I've ever heard. You know, if you\u2019re ever looking for a job, Melania's shih tzu's doghouse needs an assistant chef and\u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, Donald started to choke and gasp for air. Like a 70-year-old Joffrey Baratheon.\n\n\u201cHelp!!!\u201d he whispered to Raheem with his last dying breath.\n\nTo Donald\u2019s horror, Raheem began to smirk.\n\n\u201cI hope you enjoy those cyanide-laced muffin tops, Donald. Courtesy of The African Americans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Donald died all dead and shit.\n\nAnd then Raheem went back into the store. And took his Raheem mask off to reveal that it was really Thandie Newton. Who then took the Thandie Newton mask off to reveal that it was really Chance The Rapper.\n\nThe end.", "keywords": ["horror", "muffin", "papat", "took", "donald", "does", "halloween", "blacks", "trump", "raheem", "tops", "really", "door", "black", "hood"], "polarity": 0.08372223981980081, "subjectivity": 0.497097866000305},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

More people died at the hands of police in 2017 than the number of black people who were lynched in the worst year of Jim Crow (161 in 1892). Cops killed more Americans in 2017 than terrorists did (four). They killed more citizens than airplanes (13 deaths worldwide), mass shooters (428 deaths) and Chicago\u2019s \u201ctop gang thugs\u201d (675 Chicago homicides).\n\nYet only 12 officers were charged with a crime related to a shooting death.\n\nAn extensive new study from Mapping Police Violence details the data for police violence. The collective tracks police shooting numbers and statistics, maps the incidents and compiles the data in real time. The site uses information from a number of sources, including Killed by Police, Fatal Encounters and the U.S. Police Shootings Database, to break down shootings by race, location, weapons used, and whether or not the victim was armed. It is a valuable tool used by academics, researchers and certain writers at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that only 1 percent of the officers who killed someone were charged with a crime in 2017, some of the report\u2019s most interesting facts include the following:\n\n\n\nOf the 534 killer cops Mapping Police Violence was able to identify, 43 had shot or killed someone before. Twelve had previously shot or killed multiple people.\n\nMost of the people killed (718) were suspects in nonviolent offenses, were stopped for traffic violations or had committed no crime at all.\n\n13 percent of people killed by cops were unarmed.\n\nMost of the unarmed victims were people of color. Of the 147 unarmed people killed by police, 48 were black and 34 were Hispanic.\n\nBlack people accounted for 27 percent of the people killed by law enforcement officers. Of the unarmed victims of police violence, blacks made up 37 percent, almost three times their percentage of the U.S. population (13 percent).\n\nOf the people who were unarmed and not attacking, but were still killed by cops, 35 percent were black.\n\n95 people were killed when police shot at a moving vehicle, a practice that many say should be banned.\n\n170 of the people killed were armed with a knife. in 117 of those incidents, police shot the person before trying any other method to disarm the person.\n\n20 percent of the people who had a gun when they were killed were not threatening anyone.\n\nLaw enforcement training spends seven times more hours training officers on the use of firearms than on how to de-escalate situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, only 12 officers were charged with a crime after killing 1,129 citizens they were sworn to protect and serve.

Serving undercooked and/or underseasoned meat at events Black people happen to be at\n\nPictured above is some undercooked and awkwardly seasoned chicken I took home from an event several days ago. Words can not fully encapsulate how disappointing and fraudulent this chicken was. This chicken was the final season of Lost. It was Shemar Moore's cornrow wig in Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If Jeb Bush's presidential campaign had an official food, this chicken would have been it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, this was an event thrown by Black people. In honor of some other Black people. Which is why what you're witnessing is a crime. Because it's criminal to be a Black person and invite a hundred Black people somewhere and serve them despondent chicken. There's no country \u2014 at least not in Black America \u2014 for gloomy poultry. Nor shall there ever be.\n\n(Why, you ask, did I even bother bringing this griefstricken chicken home? I wanted to see if it could be salvaged. It couldn't.)\n\n2. Serving no food at events Black people happen to be at\n\nIf you have an event or gathering that's expected to last longer than 15 minutes and you don't provide food \u2014 and you don't tell people no food will be provided \u2014 this is even more criminal than the melancholy chicken. Maybe it isn't quite a felony. But you should be punished for this. Perhaps you should be forced to relinquish every chair in your home or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Three-hour-long church services\n\nI love the Lord as much as the next person, but there's literally nothing that can happen in an 180-minute-long service that can't occur in 80 minutes. Goin' Up A Yonder is not a 47-minute-long-song, and it shouldn't take pastor 92 minutes to connect Ecclesiastes 1:11 to his heroin addiction.\n\nYet, our people keep subjecting young people to this, turning potentially enthusiastic Christians into protagonists in Kendrick Lamar verses. And this needs to be considered a crime. Because it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Surprising other Black people with the hood\n\nOf course, there's nothing wrong with the hood. The hood is the shit. Also, related, there's less danger of half-assed meat being served if you happen to be at an event in the hood. If you go to a Bougie Black People event, you might need to eat beforehand, because Bougie niggas might have the audacity to prepare and serve couscous sliders. Hood events don't have this problem. Maybe you'll get shot. But you'll get shot with a satisfied stomach.\n\nAnyway, if you are planning on inviting a friend somewhere, and this somewhere happens to be in the hood, you need to inform that person that this event is taking place in the hood. Because while the hood is great and cool, it's not great and cool to be surprised by the hood. You need to be prepared for the hood, so you can prepare for the hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Allowing bad hair to happen to good Black people\n\nIf you have a friend whose hair consistently vacillates from \"damn fool\" to \"Is he a zombie and we just haven't realized it yet?\" and this has been going on for an extended period of time, you should be charged with a crime. And no, if they always have half-assed hair, it's not their fault. They're obviously not self-aware enough to know the reason birds keep flying into their heads is because they think its a nest. Which is why it's your duty to prevent that, and a crime if you don't.\n\n6. Forcing other Black people to listen to your shitty music\n\nThink of all the terrible mixtapes and ghastly demos that have been shoved into your hands at beauty salons and barbershops and Megabus stations and family reunions. Now, think of how lovely the world would be if the distribution of shitty rapping and abhorrent singing came with a citation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Strolling at grown-up ass parties\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever been at a party as a grown-ass man or woman, saw a group of frat bros or sorority sisters starting to stroll, and thought \"Holy shit! This is my favorite part of the night! I love when this happens so much!!!\" Of course, me asking you to put your hands up while I'm typing on a laptop in Pittsburgh is a fruitless exercise. Because I can't see any hands. But I'm going to assume that if I was able to see each of you, none of you would have your hands up right now. Unless you happen to be Greek.\n\n8. Asking for hook-ups from Black people who have been at jobs for literally 37 seconds\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your boy just got hired at 12:22pm, and you're already texting him about potential hook ups at 12:37pm, you should probably spend a weekend or two in prison. Because you're a bad person. But mainly because you're single-handedly ruining our employment rates. I don't have any numbers in front of me, but I'd wager at least 52% of Black people who've been laid off were laid off because friends and family kept asking for the hook-up. Even for shit where hook-ups don't even register. (\"I'm a security guard at the bank, Jerome. How the hell am I going to hook-up your credit?\")\n\n9. Undertipping\n\nAlthough the server undertipped might not be Black, it eventually ends up being a form of Black-on-Black crime, because that server might then assume the next Black people she sees will be shitty tippers too. Which'll make her give them substandard service; misremembering orders with an attitude and forgetting forks and shit. Which will make them cuss her out. Which will get them arrested. And Arrested While Black At The Olive Garden is a class B felony in 32 states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Playing basketball with no shirt on\n\nYou're not Morris Chestnut or Taye Diggs, and this isn't a cliche scene in a Black movie where a group of boys shoot hoops and debate whether Shaun should come to the wedding because he fucked Lisa in college and Lisa didn't tell Darrell about it yet and it might cause some friction within the group even though all this shit happened 19 years ago.\n\nNo one wants to post you up and get a back full of chest sweat. And then go commit a crime because, after they have a back full of chest sweat, they're so angry that they have to go and rob someone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust put your fucking shirt on.", "keywords": ["chicken", "committing", "youre", "types", "stop", "dont", "hood", "need", "blackonblack", "black", "happen", "crime", "event", "theres", "shit"], "polarity": -0.08706360353130023, "subjectivity": 0.541412520064205},

Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber\u2019s funeral expenses, go here.", "keywords": ["shot", "los", "neighborhood", "community", "weber", "young", "black", "aj", "death", "angeles", "anthony", "16yearold", "reels", "killing"], "polarity": -0.0647421536796537, "subjectivity": 0.4544421296296296},

Other evidence, including shell casings, witness statements and forensic analysis, indicated that Rialmo was apparently farther away from LeGrier when he fired than he initially said he was.\n\nAccording to the Tribune, LeGrier fell in the vestibule of the apartment building. Rialmo said that he fired from the building\u2019s front porch. However, it has since been determined that it was more likely that Rialmo fired from between the bottom of the porch and the sidewalk outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the board concluded, would have had no reason to believe that he was in danger of death or serious injury.\n\nIt was not immediately made public what recommendations for punishment disciplinary authorities made, but the Tribune notes that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability usually recommends termination for officers involved in unjustified shootings. After that, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will have three months to decide what form of discipline, if any, he will take.\n\nRialmo\u2019s attorney, of course, is paid to argue for his client, and he claimed that the agency\u2019s ruling cast the evidence in a misleading light, pointing out that LeGrier appeared to be suffering from a mental health crisis during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anybody not to feel that their life was in danger in such a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political decision, not one based on the evidence. ...

And I know he didn\u2019t. I knew he was just as much a victim as she was. He was innocent, too,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is worth noting that the Cook County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute Rialmo in February, claiming that there was insufficient evidence (evidence that COPA managed to get its hands on, but I digress) that Rialmo was not acting in self-defense.\n\nEarlier this month, just to add insult to injury, attorneys for the city of Chicago announced that they were toying with the idea of suing LeGrier\u2019s family, claiming that he\u2014a teen suffering through a mental health crisis\u2014was to blame for Jones\u2019 death.\n\nRialmo himself filed a lawsuit against LeGrier\u2019s estate on the grounds of emotional distress and assault, claiming that the teen forced Rialmo to kill him. Rialmo also sued the city of Chicago, saying that he was not properly trained to handle tense encounters with those with mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.", "keywords": ["officer", "chicago", "office", "evidence", "mental", "jones", "tribune", "oversight", "fired", "shooting", "unjustified", "officers", "fatal", "finds", "quintonio", "rialmo", "board", "legrier"], "polarity": 0.04088541666666666, "subjectivity": 0.33385416666666656},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/on-the-duality-and-double-consciousness-of-black-panthe-1823260321", "title": "/on-the-duality-and-double-consciousness-of-black-panthe-", "text": "Through my multiple viewings of Black Panther (four so far), I become aware of certain traits of the characters, their ideals and how the actors\u2019 portrayals of them shed light on the struggles that black people and the world at large experience with tradition vs. technology, and other dichotomies.\n\nThey stand out to me because it illustrates that Black Panther\u2014i.e., T\u2019Challa himself\u2014is contending with a double consciousness, which is not unfamiliar when it comes to blackness. While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding, Killmonger chooses death later on instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut, and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future. How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that [he] had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees, Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him, and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wakanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully, she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving as two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film, and she thinks that that is enough for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the Kingsguard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrupt, so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cFuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference: Killmonger reminds me of Cersei; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cersei has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cersei literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule; he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid. What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin.

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy. Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground. The media also initially reported her nephew as a suspect and gang member.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasmyne Cannick is a nationally known writer and commentator on politics, race and social issues.

The Juvenile was later transported to University of Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham, and subsequently released. City of Troy Police Chief Randall Barr requested the Alabama State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) conduct an independent investigation into the use of force by his officers.

Officers chased him a few streets over before they started beating him.\n\nWSFA-TV reports that the teen refused to comply with officers\u2019 demands to put his hands behind his back.

But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Ain\u2019t gonna tear up my cars.\u201d\n\nShoupe was not part of the slow-speed chase that spanned two counties, but he arrived on scene shortly after his officers fired the deadly shots, which was when his comments were recorded.\n\n\u201cI love this shit,\u201d he continues. \u201cGod, I tell you what, I thrive on it. If they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker, they\u2019re full of shit. Take him out. I\u2019m here on the damn wrong end of the county.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaughter can be heard as the sheriff makes his comments.\n\nThe incident began last April when Smithville, Tenn., police tried to pull Dial over for driving on a suspended license. At the time, he was driving a 1976 pickup with a fully loaded trailer being pulled at the back. The chase started in DeKalb County before crossing over into White County, where White County deputies took over the chase.\n\nDial\u2019s wife, Robyn, says she is still not sure how the situation escalated so quickly, leading to the death of her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop?\u201d Robyn Dial said. \u201cHe was scared. I know him enough to know that.\u201d\n\nThe chase never reached high speeds. DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["shoot", "county", "ordering", "chase", "slowspeed", "dial", "tennessee", "dont", "unarmed", "told", "white", "officers", "deputies", "recorded", "sheriff", "shoupe", "west", "shit", "man"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the revelation that the supervisor of the unit instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves \u201cin a jam\u201d and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn\u2019t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won\u2019t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before he was set to testify.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: After the death of Freddie Gray and the discovery of multiple officers who planted drugs on suspects, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they\u2019re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the cop who killed Tamir Rice after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who said he shot a man because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid police informant planted cocaine in a store owner\u2019s shop.\n\nIt is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away. And they will get away with it so often that we are shocked when they are indicted.\n\nThat\u2019s the real story.", "keywords": ["guns", "department", "cops", "toy", "maybe", "kept", "unarmed", "plant", "case", "baltimore", "officers", "boy", "person", "gun", "drug", "shot"], "polarity": 0.05545454545454546, "subjectivity": 0.4552587412587413},

The redevelopment has been so dramatic, the name of the neighborhood has changed. Some now call it Eastside\u2014a colonizing portmanteau of East Liberty and the neighboring (and predominantly white) Shadyside.\n\nThis is also where I grew up. And the East Liberty of the early and mid-\u201990s was a vastly different place than it is today. From 1989 to 1995, my parents and I lived on the 700 block of Mellon Street, perhaps the hottest stretch in what was then a crime- and gang-infested neighborhood. I\u2019ve seen it all\u2014drive-bys, crack, stabbings, shootings, murders. My mom was even shot while sleeping in her bed by a drug dealer who mistook our house for a rival\u2019s and shot through our windows. (The bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her wrist.)\n\nBasically, I know what it means to live in the hood because, well, I\u2019ve lived in the hood. And I also know that misinformation about living in the hood is pervasive, existing everywhere from news articles and TV shows about it to the conversations that people not from it have about it. Some of these inaccurate presumptions and outright lies are a bit more popular\u2014and a bit more dangerous\u2014than the rest. Here are 10:\n\n1. Kids who are smart are teased and bullied for \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, this experience is/was, in fact, the reality for many kids from the hood. I don\u2019t want to pretend as if these things didn\u2019t happen to them. But that experience is often thought of as the norm, when it\u2019s more of the exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, teasing and bullying might happen, because teasing and bullying happen everywhere. But if you\u2019re a kid in the hood who has some sort of academic/intellectual talent, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll have people in the neighborhood supporting and protecting you than trying to beat the \u201cwhiteness\u201d out of you.\n\n2. People in the hood face constant pressure from drug dealers and/or gang members to join them.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure there are many people who were, in fact, pressured to join gangs and/or hustle. But the idea of every hood being overrun by aggressive dopeboys threatening everyone to be down just ain\u2019t true. If anything, they\u2019re mostly nonchalant about it, like, \u201cIf you wanna be down, fine. If not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keeping with this theme ...\n\n3. All drug dealers have money.\n\nOf course, there are some who do quite well financially. But there are many others\u2014so many others\u2014who\u2019d be making considerably more money at Home Depot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Most young people don\u2019t make it past 21.\n\nI\u2019ve always been annoyed at the idea that kids from the hood are lucky to make it to 21. While the murder rates are definitely dangerously and depressingly high in many neighborhoods, it\u2019s not like 75 percent. Most people from the hood make it to 21. And 31. And 41. And 51. (But not 61, because stress.)\n\n5. You must know how to fight because that\u2019s the only way you would\u2019ve been able to survive.\n\nEh, no.\n\nOf course, being able to handle yourself is a valuable skill to have. But you know what\u2019s more valuable? Walking and looking like you know how to handle yourself. And being hyperaware of your surroundings so you know how to avoid situations where you\u2019d be forced to handle yourself. And having friends or family who can handle themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso ...\n\n6. If you want to avoid the trappings of the hood, you should probably stay in the house as much as possible.\n\nPerhaps this was/is a good strategy for some people. But in my experience, the best way to avoid finding trouble was staying busy with activities. Sports, school, art, work, whatever. Of the people I knew who got caught up, the main thing that caught them was sheer boredom. They spent all of their time on the block because they didn\u2019t have shit else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There are no middle-class families in the hood.\n\nUntrue. Because of structural racism and historical restrictions on where black people were/are able to rent and buy property (and there have been numerous studies proving this), it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to find people with middle-class incomes in those neighborhoods.\n\n8. There are no nuclear families in the hood.\n\nYes, there are actually nuclear families in the hood. This means that there are actually black children who happen to live in the hood and under the same roof as their dads\u2014who also happen to be married to their moms. Crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Poor black parents don\u2019t care about their children.\n\nOne of the most common ways this \u201ctruth\u201d is articulated is through parent-teacher conferences. Basically, that in more affluent (read: white) neighborhoods, parents are so hyperinvolved that teachers have to make specific schedules to accommodate all of the parents interested in meeting with them. Whereas teachers in the hood are lucky to speak to/meet one parent\u2014which is seen as an obvious sign of disinterest and/or neglect.\n\nThe reality, however, is more complicated. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t able to take off work and attend. Sometimes the parent hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with schools and teachers, and sincerely believes their child would fare better without their involvement. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t aware that the parent-teacher conferences are happening because the school didn\u2019t bother sending any notices to them. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous to believe that lack of income somehow correlates to lack of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. People in the hood are controlled by a constant fear of violence.\n\nOf course, violence exists. It destroys lives, rips apart families and can, in some cases, create a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder. Violence fucking sucks.\n\nBut while violence is a reality, it doesn\u2019t prevent the entire hood from leaving the house. Or from hanging out on the corner. Or from being neighborly and friendly. Or from attending and perhaps even throwing block parties. Even the hottest blocks will have kids double-Dutching and playing touch-tab football on them. You might even find some old heads laughing and drinking tea on a porch. Maybe you\u2019d assume they were celebrating making it past 21. But they probably just want to talk to one another about 401(k)s.", "keywords": ["misconceptions", "stop", "handle", "parents", "lies", "need", "believing", "families", "spreading", "happen", "hood", "east", "know", "neighborhood", "course", "kids"], "polarity": 0.14255499438832772, "subjectivity": 0.48307671957671966},

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["friends", "talk", "colston", "going", "look", "fans", "favorite", "work", "movie", "white", "lowe", "black", "panther", "internets", "finally", "video", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

The redevelopment has been so dramatic, the name of the neighborhood has changed. Some now call it Eastside\u2014a colonizing portmanteau of East Liberty and the neighboring (and predominantly white) Shadyside.\n\nThis is also where I grew up. And the East Liberty of the early and mid-\u201990s was a vastly different place than it is today. From 1989 to 1995, my parents and I lived on the 700 block of Mellon Street, perhaps the hottest stretch in what was then a crime- and gang-infested neighborhood. I\u2019ve seen it all\u2014drive-bys, crack, stabbings, shootings, murders. My mom was even shot while sleeping in her bed by a drug dealer who mistook our house for a rival\u2019s and shot through our windows. (The bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her wrist.)\n\nBasically, I know what it means to live in the hood because, well, I\u2019ve lived in the hood. And I also know that misinformation about living in the hood is pervasive, existing everywhere from news articles and TV shows about it to the conversations that people not from it have about it. Some of these inaccurate presumptions and outright lies are a bit more popular\u2014and a bit more dangerous\u2014than the rest. Here are 10:\n\n1. Kids who are smart are teased and bullied for \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, this experience is/was, in fact, the reality for many kids from the hood. I don\u2019t want to pretend as if these things didn\u2019t happen to them. But that experience is often thought of as the norm, when it\u2019s more of the exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, teasing and bullying might happen, because teasing and bullying happen everywhere. But if you\u2019re a kid in the hood who has some sort of academic/intellectual talent, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll have people in the neighborhood supporting and protecting you than trying to beat the \u201cwhiteness\u201d out of you.\n\n2. People in the hood face constant pressure from drug dealers and/or gang members to join them.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure there are many people who were, in fact, pressured to join gangs and/or hustle. But the idea of every hood being overrun by aggressive dopeboys threatening everyone to be down just ain\u2019t true. If anything, they\u2019re mostly nonchalant about it, like, \u201cIf you wanna be down, fine. If not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keeping with this theme ...\n\n3. All drug dealers have money.\n\nOf course, there are some who do quite well financially. But there are many others\u2014so many others\u2014who\u2019d be making considerably more money at Home Depot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Most young people don\u2019t make it past 21.\n\nI\u2019ve always been annoyed at the idea that kids from the hood are lucky to make it to 21. While the murder rates are definitely dangerously and depressingly high in many neighborhoods, it\u2019s not like 75 percent. Most people from the hood make it to 21. And 31. And 41. And 51. (But not 61, because stress.)\n\n5. You must know how to fight because that\u2019s the only way you would\u2019ve been able to survive.\n\nEh, no.\n\nOf course, being able to handle yourself is a valuable skill to have. But you know what\u2019s more valuable? Walking and looking like you know how to handle yourself. And being hyperaware of your surroundings so you know how to avoid situations where you\u2019d be forced to handle yourself. And having friends or family who can handle themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso ...\n\n6. If you want to avoid the trappings of the hood, you should probably stay in the house as much as possible.\n\nPerhaps this was/is a good strategy for some people. But in my experience, the best way to avoid finding trouble was staying busy with activities. Sports, school, art, work, whatever. Of the people I knew who got caught up, the main thing that caught them was sheer boredom. They spent all of their time on the block because they didn\u2019t have shit else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There are no middle-class families in the hood.\n\nUntrue. Because of structural racism and historical restrictions on where black people were/are able to rent and buy property (and there have been numerous studies proving this), it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to find people with middle-class incomes in those neighborhoods.\n\n8. There are no nuclear families in the hood.\n\nYes, there are actually nuclear families in the hood. This means that there are actually black children who happen to live in the hood and under the same roof as their dads\u2014who also happen to be married to their moms. Crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Poor black parents don\u2019t care about their children.\n\nOne of the most common ways this \u201ctruth\u201d is articulated is through parent-teacher conferences. Basically, that in more affluent (read: white) neighborhoods, parents are so hyperinvolved that teachers have to make specific schedules to accommodate all of the parents interested in meeting with them. Whereas teachers in the hood are lucky to speak to/meet one parent\u2014which is seen as an obvious sign of disinterest and/or neglect.\n\nThe reality, however, is more complicated. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t able to take off work and attend. Sometimes the parent hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with schools and teachers, and sincerely believes their child would fare better without their involvement. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t aware that the parent-teacher conferences are happening because the school didn\u2019t bother sending any notices to them. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous to believe that lack of income somehow correlates to lack of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. People in the hood are controlled by a constant fear of violence.\n\nOf course, violence exists. It destroys lives, rips apart families and can, in some cases, create a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder. Violence fucking sucks.\n\nBut while violence is a reality, it doesn\u2019t prevent the entire hood from leaving the house. Or from hanging out on the corner. Or from being neighborly and friendly. Or from attending and perhaps even throwing block parties. Even the hottest blocks will have kids double-Dutching and playing touch-tab football on them. You might even find some old heads laughing and drinking tea on a porch. Maybe you\u2019d assume they were celebrating making it past 21. But they probably just want to talk to one another about 401(k)s.", "keywords": ["misconceptions", "stop", "handle", "parents", "lies", "need", "believing", "families", "spreading", "happen", "hood", "east", "know", "neighborhood", "course", "kids"], "polarity": 0.14255499438832772, "subjectivity": 0.48307671957671966},

But better still is Mon\u00e1e\u2019s thought process behind the videos and the album, which she shared with The Guardian in an article published Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the article, Mon\u00e1e discusses the death of her longtime mentor, Prince, whose influence can be felt both sonically and visually in \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to even speak about this because Prince was helping me with the album, before he passed on to another frequency,\u201d she says. His sudden death was \u201ca stab in the stomach. The last time I saw him was New Year\u2019s Day. I performed a private party in St Bart\u2019s with him, and after we sat and just talked for five hours. He was one of the people I would talk to about things, him and Stevie Wonder.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable with who I am if it had not been for Prince. I mean, my label Wondaland would not exist without Paisley Park coming before us,\u201d Mon\u00e1e says. She laughs a little. \u201cHe would probably get me for cussin\u2019, but Prince is in that \u2018free motherfucker\u2019 category. That\u2019s the category when we can recognise in each other that you\u2019re also a free motherfucker. Whether we curse or not, we see other free motherfuckers. David Bowie! A free motherfucker. I feel their spirit, I feel their energy. They were able to evolve. You felt that freedom in them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom is in the foreground of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s newest project. It\u2019s about being bold and unapologetic in her identity as a black woman. She told The Guardian:\n\nDjango Jane is \u201ca response to me feeling the sting of the threats being made to my rights as a woman, as a black woman, as a sexually liberated woman, even just as a daughter with parents who have been oppressed for many decades. Black women and those who have been the \u2018other\u2019, and the marginalised in society \u2013 that\u2019s who I wanted to support, and that was more important than my discomfort about speaking out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the article notes, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d captures some of this sexual liberation. Tessa Thompson makes an appearance in the video as a potential love interest, along with a man. The two share heated glances, and a few scenes seem to refer back to Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode, a utopian fever dream that features a queer interracial couple.\n\nHere\u2019s how Mon\u00e1e described it:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a celebratory song,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that comes across. That people feel more free, no matter where they are in their lives, that they feel celebrated. Because I\u2019m about women\u2019s empowerment. I\u2019m about agency. I\u2019m about being in control of your narrative and your body. That was personal for me to even talk about: to let people know you don\u2019t own or control me and you will not use my image to defame or denounce other women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat final point\u2014about how people use her image to \u201cdefame or denounce\u201d other women\u2014is one that particularly bothers Mon\u00e1e.\n\n\u201cI see how people try to pit women against each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are people who have used my image to slut-shame other women: \u2018Janelle, we really appreciate that you don\u2019t show your body.\u2019 That\u2019s something I\u2019m not cool with. I have worn a tuxedo, but I have never covered up for respectability politics or to shame other women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe running theme in Mon\u00e1e\u2019s interview is of seizing control and being herself on her own terms\u2014something she\u2019s always done but is realizing in greater depth, detail and clarity with Dirty Computer.\n\n\u201cThis project was about painting in different colours, not just black and white; going in and allowing myself to use all the shades of the crayon box,\u201d Mon\u00e1e told The Guardian. \u201cIt was time to focus on being a complete, complex human being. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna come with me and who\u2019s gonna criticize me, but I\u2019m not gonna renege, and I\u2019m not gonna hide.\u201d", "keywords": ["im", "prince", "thought", "women", "painting", "process", "mon\u00e1e", "gonna", "janelle", "inspiring", "dirty", "mon\u00e1es", "white", "feel", "black", "free", "woman", "outside"], "polarity": 0.09677098857426726, "subjectivity": 0.546727521112767},

The technologically advanced nation suffered grievous losses that threaten to destabilize it, but there\u2019s something else behind the scenes working to kick T\u2019Challa off the throne. Coates\u2019 Panther tenure is one that\u2019s grappled with big ideas, operatic scope, and keen insight into human nature. (Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian Stelfreeze, Laura Martin; Marvel)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther: World of Wakanda\n\nA companion to Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet, this collected volume takes readers inside the fierce Dora Milaje fighting corps.

This scholarly volume unearths the contributions of pioneers like Jackie Ormes and investigates the tropes and trends that black women creators and characters created and shattered over the lifespan of the comics medium. (Deborah Elizabeth Whaley; University of Washington Press)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrotherman: Dictator of Discipline and Brotherman: Revelation\n\nFirst created by a group of brothers in 1990, the character nicknamed Dictator of Discipline has seen two independently published iterations across the decades. The original black-and-white series focused on a burly crimefighter who took on a series of funkily bizarre criminals in the over-the-top metropolis of Big City, while a 2016 origin story subtitled Revelation shows how skinny Antonio Valor embarked on his journey to clean up his hometown\u2019s streets. Brotherman\u2019s winning formula combines bold linework with a larger-than-life aesthetic to create the series\u2019 melodramatic yet relatable narratives.

It tells the story of Josiah X, a black man who doesn\u2019t care about being a hero despite a past intertwined with the experiments that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America. Josiah\u2019s life story is like a photo negative of Rogers\u2019, showing him treated like a disposable pawn on the front lines of Vietnam and as a disillusioned veteran in a black militant activist group. When he finally picks up a shield, it\u2019s because he\u2019s determined to save the lives America has ignored. (Christopher Priest, Joe Bennett, Danny Miki; Marvel)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeathlok: The Souls of Cyber Folk\n\nThis early \u201890s series re-imagined Marvel Comics\u2019 old-school killing-machine cyborg as a walking paradox. Pacifist scientist Michael Collins found himself trapped in a body designed solely for wreaking havoc, with his family believing him to be dead and his real body stolen by the evil corporation he used to work for. Deathlok worked as a metaphorical exploration of what it means to wield power responsibly and the extent to which our identities are tied to both our actions and physical appearances. (Dwayne McDuffie, Gregory Wright, Mike Manley, John Hebert, Denys Cowan; Marvel)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDestroyer\n\nJo Baker suffered a painful loss of the sort that\u2019s become all too familiar: Cops took the life of her young African American son for no damn reason at all. But Baker did more than just grieve. A descendant of Victor Frankenstein, she used her skills as a scientist and alchemist to bring her dead child Akai back to life with the ability to disassemble matter with a thought. Destroyer pits Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, Dr. Baker, and Akai against each other, as well as a shadowy alchemical corporation that wants only the \u201cright\u201d people to have the power of life after death.

Like, say, lynchings in the Deep South. The first Incognegro graphic novel shows Zane investigating the murder charge that threatens to have his own brother hung from a tree, while the new Renaissance miniseries shows Zane learning to slip across the color line for the first time in Jazz Age Harlem.

Lead character Dana mysteriously travels back to a 19th-century plantation where she must endeavor to save her own white, slave-owning ancestor. The graphic novel adaptation streamlines Butler\u2019s plot and also makes the strain, violation, and fear all the more palpable.

The titular hero is a no-nonsense field operative pulled into dealing with the worst kind of nonsense: People with superpowers. While facing off against twisted versions of Green Arrow, the Flash, and Aquaman, Cray\u2019s also dealing with a mysterious illness that might be haphazardly altering reality. The best thing about Michael Cray is its chilling subversion of the power dynamics and assumption of trustworthiness implicit in superhero fare. (Bryan Edward Hill, N. Steve Harris, Dexter Vines; DC Comics)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder Ballads\n\nOne of the most painful truths about American culture is how little black musicians profited from industries that were built on foundations they laid. Murder Ballads explores the dynamic of how white and black lives intersect at the crossroads of art and commerce, through the tense relationship of white record label owner Nate Theodore and the bluesmen brothers he \u201cdiscovers\u201d while his life slides down the toilet. It\u2019s a gripping story that gives voice to the exploited souls still haunting America\u2019s airwaves.

In the six-issue series, the reinvented nocturnal avenger brutally retaliated against racist police officers, opportunistic drug dealers, and sleazy real estate developers. There\u2019s a grisly serial killer plotline in the midst of it all, too, pushing Nighthawk into places where very little superhero work is brave enough to tread.

A Complicated Man sees Shaft come home from Vietnam and help his paramour find a missing friend, while Imitation of Life gets slightly metatextual as the detective finds himself hired on as a bodyguard on a movie that\u2019s based on his life. These comics show that there\u2019s more to Shaft than what\u2019s been in books and movies, and they\u2019re clearly created by people who love Ernest Tidyman\u2019s famous character.

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

We shouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation because Kaepernick would have been signed weeks ago. Except racism.\n\n\n\nBut since we\u2019re here \u2014 and since I was a student in Baltimore in the Ray Lewis era \u2014 here are three great, non-football reasons the Ravens should sign Kaep before the end of the day:\n\n1. The Two Rays\n\nBefore he met with Donald Trump last year and before he made a habit of dropping biblical references in his color commentary, Ray Lewis was charged with stabbing two guys to death in Atlanta. And we all saw what Ray Rice did in that elevator \u2014 I spent my entire summer of 2014 on CNN talking about it. Lewis beat the murder rap and was deified by Ravens fans for the rest of his career. Rice never played another snap in the NFL, but some of the classier Baltimorons still rocked his jersey to games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that\u2019s the reception these guys got from Baltimore, I\u2019m not here for any complaints about Kaepernick.\n\n2. Lake Trout\n\nYes, it\u2019s stereotypical to list greasy-ass fried fish as a reason a Black man should move to a city for a job. But Lake Trout joints are all over the place in Baltimore. That greasy-ass fried fish on two slices of white bread, plus fries and a half-and-half tastes good as shit and damn near got me through college. I struggle to think of a blacker thing than Kaep \u2014 afro in full splendor \u2014 rolling up Park Heights or down Pennsylvania Avenue for a lake trout combo. And since he spent 2016 doing one Blackest Thing Ever after another, and being vilified for it, he gets to do this and y\u2019all don\u2019t get to say a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Baltimore is Black as fuck\n\nPolling firm J.D. Power yesterday released a survey of 9,200 obviously white people about their sports-watching habits in 2016. While ESPN (my former employer) ran with the headline that protests were the biggest reason people turned off football last year, the Washington Post debunked that thoroughly. Kaepernick\u2019s presence in Baltimore would challenge the narrative that anthem protests are turning off football fans. This is, after all, where youth clashed with police over Freddie Gray\u2019s death. It\u2019s the same town that elected a prosecutor who took charged all six officers involved in the incident; the same town where jurors once acquitted a teenager accused in the death of an officer even though the kid had been literally been pulled out of the car as it was on top of the police cruiser because the jurors didn\u2019t trust cops\u2019 testimony.\n\nIt\u2019s the same town where the US Department of Justice concluded that the police department \u201cengages in a pattern or practice of: (1) making unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests; (2) using enforcement strategies that produce severe and unjustified disparities in the rates of stops, searches and arrests of African Americans; (3) using excessive force; and (4) retaliating against people engaging in constitutionally-protected expression.\u201d\n\n\n\nBaltimore is not a town where a guy like Kaepernick will hear a lot of boos for protesting against police violence (at least not the same way he would in Kansas City or Pittsburgh) because Baltimoreans \u2014 63 percent of whom are black \u2014 are too familiar with police misconduct. Ravens fans, at least a big chunk of them, would have no problem with Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem, even if he did it while eating a greasy-ass fish sandwich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeith Reed is a Pittsburgh-born writer and editor who's worked for ESPN Mag and The Boston Globe", "keywords": ["best", "fish", "guys", "colin", "town", "lewis", "reasons", "city", "baltimore", "kaepernick", "lake", "greasyass", "ray", "ravens", "nonfootball"], "polarity": -0.04203216374269007, "subjectivity": 0.42404970760233923},

Call me back at the God hour.\" You'd walk in and the entire wait staff would be past-their-prime rappers. Lady of Rage and Bahamadia would be the hostesses, Redman, U-God, and Black Rob the servers, Spliff Star, Grand Puba, and Amil the cooks, and Raekwon the Chef would be the actual head chef. The menu would be filled with nods to that era. Perhaps you might be in the mood for the Ol' Dirty Rice Bowl. Or maybe the Master Peas and Gravy. If really hungry, you could even get the What's Roast Beef? with your DMXtra Spicy Wing Dings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe skit wouldn't actually air on TV. After filming it, they'd realize its one of those instances where the idea behind the skit is better than the actual skit, and would cut it from the episode. But it would find a life on that season's DVD box set; included with other bits that didn't make the cut.\n\nOf course, White people seem intent on proving they're able to create realities far more absurd and ridiculous than any fiction. Which is why East Liberty \u2014 which used to be a Black Pittsburgh cultural nexus but is rapidly morphing into Yinzer Williamsburg \u2014 will soon be home to \"The Coop,\" which promises to be an \"urban, street style type of place\" serving fast casual fried chicken, according to Adam Kucenic (the owner). It will sit next to Muddy Waters, an oyster bar created by the same owner. And on Muddy Waters' other side will soon be another Kucenic creation: \"The Big Kahuna\" \u2014 a poke bowl restaurant with a distinctly Hawaiian feel.\n\nThat said, this is a free-ish country. (For the time being at least.) And there's nothing inherently wrong with a White person launching a fried chicken spot in a still mostly Black neighborhood. Plus, fried chicken's stereotypical connection to Black people has never not been the most peculiar stereotype ever because 1) loving fried chicken isn't a bad thing and 2) everyone loves fried chicken because 3) fried chicken is fucking awesome. If aliens ever discovered and landed on Earth, I'm one hundred percent certain their first Earth meal would be an extra crispy three piece and a biscuit. And then they'd forget about their whole interplanetary domination and colonization plan and just leave Earth and take all of our chickens with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut remember way back when? When you first read the title of this piece, and said \"Wait. Um\u2026WTF?\" And then read some more just to make sure that the sheer absurdity of the title reflected a thing that was actually happening? Those feelings exist because you're aware of that historical connection between Black people and fried chicken. And you're also aware of the salmagundi of racially, culturally, and politically charged feelings that exist whenever Black residents and businesses are displaced or priced out of historically Black neighborhoods. And that context allowed you to immediately instinctively recognize that the concept behind that restaurant in that specific location is a terribly insensitive idea.\n\n\"Why\" you probably thought to yourself \"would anyone think that was cool?\"\n\nThat thought was likely followed by another thought:\n\n\"There was no friend or partner or whatever of the owner who heard about the idea and told him that maybe he should reconsider? That, even if his intentions where good, the optics and the reaction to those optics wouldn't be worth it? No one???\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenever something like this happens, there's a tendency to dismiss the act as tone deaf. This is perhaps the most optimistic way of assessing these situations, as it implies that the person's heart was in the right place, but they're just oblivious to the factors and histories making their decision a gauche one. It's understandable why that would be the first reaction, as it's easier to regard people as ignorant and in need of an education instead of intentionally reckless. It just reflects a less dire feeling about humanity.\n\nThis concept was addressed on the University of Maryland panel Panama and I were on a couple weeks ago. The infamous #PepsiLivesMatter commercial was brought up. And while the conversation started with us collectively regarding it as tone deaf, someone (I forgot who) asked if this happening was more due to ignorance or arrogance. And the more we talked about it, the more we started leaning arrogance. That the type of people behind Pepsi's misfire know that what they're doing is vulturizing the culture, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nThis conversation came to mind yesterday, while reading a Facebook thread discussing this restaurant. In it, in was revealed that the owner's girlfriend \u2014 a woman named Diana Strekalovskaya (who also might have some ownership stake) \u2014 reacted to the pushback by telling those upset to \"do something good for the community you live in\" instead of complaining. She also apparently shared a link to her own Facebook page Monday on the \"liberal fantasy of cultural appropriation.\" Of course, it can be unwise to attempt to approximate a person's cultural sensitivities and conscience solely based on two days worth of social media activity. Maybe, between sharing subtly racist statuses, she's in the lab attempting to cure sickle cell or something. But there's nothing here to suggest that the owners should be given any benefit of the doubt.

The visuals for this feminist banger are sure to garner comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation,\u201d as Mon\u00e1e is flanked by her own cadre of militantly clad women moving in tandem. But the comparisons end there as Mon\u00e1e spits lyrics like:\n\nJane Bond, never Jane Doe\n\nAnd I Django, never Sambo\n\nBlack and White, Yeah that\u2019s always been my camo\n\nIt\u2019s looking like y\u2019all gon\u2019 need some more ammo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 3 minutes and 16 seconds, Mon\u00e1e blazes through this track while barely batting an eyelash. And, of course, she looks amazing while doing it. I personally love seeing her back in her trademark tailored suits\u2014this time, in several colors, with coordinating kufis. I\u2019m also betting we\u2019ll be seeing more ring-divided braids this spring and summer.\n\nBut most striking is how Mon\u00e1e skillfully reminds us from whence we came, and that the future is indeed black and female. As she says, \u201cHit the mute button, let the vagina have a monologue.\u201d\n\nBut while \u201cDjango Jane\u201d is a banger, Mon\u00e1e still knows how to serve up a bop, and \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d definitely delivers.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

A response I made to comments on an Instagram post became fodder for a piece that I believe was designed to create conflict where there isn\u2019t any. It\u2019s perhaps more complex than that,\u201d Thompson wrote.\n\nThe actress was referring to a comment she made on a now deleted Instagram post that featured celebrities and activists celebrating the Time\u2019s Up initiative. Included in the photo was Dunham, whose presence angered and confused some commenters, who wanted to know why a woman who recently defended an accused rapist would be featured in a photo commemorating an anti-sexual-harassment initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI support this initiative and the fight for gender justice and am really glad that the movement is growing,\u201d one user commented. \u201cI however am perplexed by the inclusion of Lena Dunham, a woman who publicly accused a young sexual assault survivor of color, Aurora Perrineau, of lying about her assault.\u201d As Nylon notes, the user then went on to note that Dunham still hasn\u2019t apologized directly to Perrineau, despite the fact that the man Dunham had defended, longtime friend Murray Miller, lied.\n\n\u201cWould greatly appreciate your thoughts on this as it gravely discredits your efforts to include Lena without holding her accountable,\u201d the user wrote to Thompson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson offered this response:\n\nLena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for the actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It\u2019s been discussed.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAccording to Thompson\u2019s own account, the Girls creator was more like the chick who doesn\u2019t do a lick of work for the group project, but shows up on the day of the presentation with her hair pressed, asking if there\u2019s anything she can do to help.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would be trash enough, but remember, this \u201cgroup project\u201d\u2014in this case, demonstrative and impactful feminism\u2014is a big part of Dunham\u2019s brand.\n\nThompson\u2019s comments supported what many have suspected about Dunham\u2019s public persona versus her private work. Still, the Creed actress seemed to have a change of heart after multiple outlets covered her remarks.\n\n\u201cI, in no way, want to diminish Lena Dunham and her work, her voice, and her importance. We have spoken and she knows my heart,\u201d Thompson wrote in her Tuesday-morning statement. \u201cI feel a responsibility to women that have sometimes felt ignored, dismissed, and underrepresented. They are my beacons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson added that she regretted that her words \u201cwere misinterpreted\u201d and distracted from the size and inclusivity of the Time\u2019s Up campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Thompson would feel torn up about distracting from the Time\u2019s Up initiative, which provides a legal defense fund for women across industries who have been the victims of sexual harassment and which she has been at the forefront of promoting. To borrow overused but accurate parlance, Thompson has been \u201cdoing the work,\u201d and burying that work under comments she made about Dunham surely isn\u2019t what she intended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Dunham\u2019s feminism has been toxic for people of color, and particularly women of color, and it\u2019s fair and worthwhile to point that out. Following her support of Miller and her nonapology to Perrineau, writer Zinzi Clemmons, who has worked with Dunham and known her for years, minced no words when she said that it was time for women of color to \u201cdivest\u201d from the faux feminist.\n\n\u201cShe cannot have our words if she cannot respect us,\u201d Clemmons wrote.\n\nThe grace and work Thompson has shown are commendable.

Which made her more upset an hour later, because she was hungry. Which we solved by giving her that same refused and blueberry-deficient bowl of fruit from an hour earlier. Which she ate, of course. Because baby.\n\nI thought of her this morning when learning that Darth Cheeto plans to have the Justice Department look into and possibly end affirmative action in college admissions; the latest attempt to reverse a policy that many very stupid (White) people believe props Black people up by planting our Timberlands on hard-working White people's necks. It, like literally everything else Donald Trump has done and said in the last 18 months, is an unambiguous dog whistle to his base, who seem to believe that niggers are running free in the city \u2014 eating chicken in late model Cadillacs and using free government cell phones to order crack and White women from Seamless \u2014 while good White folks foot the bill. To them, cutting affirmative action would mean that (plantation) daddy is home, and the darkies have a curfew. And they're so happy to end these non-existent free rides for Blacks that they're willing to throw White women under the bus too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom \"Affirmative Action Has Helped White Women More Than Anyone\"\n\n\n\nWhile people of color, individually and as groups, have been helped by affirmative action in the subsequent years, data and studies suggest women \u2014 white women in particular \u2014 have benefited disproportionately. According to one study, in 1995, 6 million women, the majority of whom were white, had jobs they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise held but for affirmative action. Another study shows that women made greater gains in employment at companies that do business with the federal government, which are therefore subject to federal affirmative-action requirements, than in other companies \u2014 with female employment rising 15.2% at federal contractors but only 2.2% elsewhere. And the women working for federal-contractor companies also held higher positions and were paid better. Even in the private sector, the advancements of white women eclipse those of people of color. After IBM established its own affirmative-action program, the numbers of women in management positions more than tripled in less than 10 years. Data from subsequent years show that the number of executives of color at IBM also grew, but not nearly at the same rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this should be a surprise to anyone who knows anything about this particular grade of Whiteness. It allowed a man whose policies will hurt them more than they'll help them become President just because those same policies might hurt Black and Brown people too. The entire contemporary conservative agenda is driven by this unstoppable and unstoppably White compulsion to cut off their noses to spite their faces. And now, if affirmative action is ended, the Abigail Fishers of the world \u2014 hoping, wishing, and praying that the universe considers and treats their half-empty bottle of backwashed Aquafina-ass asses like a case of LaCroix \u2014 will have even less opportunity to show the world to Eat, Pray, and be Average as fuck.", "keywords": ["women", "college", "companies", "administration", "federal", "world", "affirmative", "trump", "white", "action", "fruit", "color", "free", "tackle"], "polarity": 0.10318287037037034, "subjectivity": 0.4236689814814814},

I barely pay attention to those reports because 1) I do not invest in the stock market presently, and 2) numbers and I go together about as well as Future and his baby mamas.

That\u2019s about it. If you don\u2019t like these movies by now, you\u2019re probably a deplorable who hates everything coming out of Hollywood or you just hate superhero movies because you only watch PBS and C-SPAN. Sorry, those are your only options.\n\n\n\nSo the question is no longer are the Marvel superhero movies good\u2014Disney\u2019s brand management and quality control of the franchise is up there with apple pie and the iPhone\u2014but how good is the latest installment, Thor: Ragnarok?\n\nMore importantly, does this movie actually have black and brown people who are actively a part of the plot, or is it some gentrified diversity trash like Spider-Man: Homecoming?\n\nThe answer to both is pretty interesting, and you don\u2019t even need that many spoilers to find out.\n\nThor: Ragnarok is a visually stunning, loud, bright, hilarious \u201980s-throwback film in all the best ways possible. Not in a kitschy, nostalgic, VH1 I Love the 80s type of way; more in a thematic, world-building Stranger Things way. Director Taika Waititi captures the synthesized music, bright neon colors, side-scrolling action and humor of movies like Krull, Highlander, Star Trek: Wrath of Kahn, The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai and, of course, Flash Gordon, which were all commercial and cult favorites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhereas the ham-fisted Guardians of the Galaxy movies try to repackage the age-old \u201ccocky, Midwestern white guy stumbles into heroism and wins over the native/alien/brown woman\u201d shtick with an easy-listening, early-\u201980s soundtrack, Thor: Ragnarok gives you the \u201980s aesthetic without the annoying lovable, lunkhead, white-hero aftertaste. Black people, brown people (even green people) and women all play significant, independent roles in the movie in both action and comedy. It\u2019s glorious.\n\nIn the context of the larger Avengers universe, Thor: Ragnarok explains what\u2019s happened to Thor (and the Hulk) in the two years since Avengers: Age of Ultron ended. Thor has been having dreams that Asgard will face ultimate destruction in Ragnarok, which is basically Asgardian Armageddon, and he is traveling around the dimensions trying to stop it. Hulk has ended up on some weird gladiator world, which is a real treat if you read the excellent Planet Hulk comic a few years back.\n\nOver the course of the movie, between witty one-liners and action sequences, Thor is beaten, kidnapped, meets a ton of guest stars, starts his own team, foments a revolution and completes the personal arc you totally forgot he had from the first Thor movie. Will the little god-king son of Odin learn to be anything more than a mead-swilling hot head running from adventure to adventure? The answer is \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly, Marvel has finally made a movie where black characters and women aren\u2019t window dressing but actually live in the story. In the first two Thor films, his home planet/dimension of Asgard looked like a gentrified neighborhood during Renaissance Faire weekend. In Thor: Ragnarok, the crowds of Asgardians, the soldiers, even the bad guys, come in all colors and genders. No powerless sidekicks. No agency-free, brown love interests.\n\nThis is a new and welcome development across all of the Avengers movies. No black woman had spoken more than about three consecutive lines of dialogue in a Marvel film until 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War (the 14th movie in the Marvel movie franchise), so Tessa Thompson as the boozy, haunted Valkyrie was a major improvement.\n\nIdris Elba\u2019s character Heimdall has evolved from the interdimensional doorman in the first Thor movie to a hero in his own right in Thor: Ragnarok. I still don\u2019t understand why Thor\u2019s Heimdall and Bishop from X-Men: Days of Future Past have to shop exclusively at the \u201cLone Black Revolutionary Guy\u201d section at Hot Topic (maybe they had a sale on tattered capes and colored contact lenses), but that\u2019s a minor complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the people of color in the movie managed to get through the film without dying for, worshipping or falling in love with Thor, and for that, I am forever thankful to Waititi.\n\nSpeaking of being grateful, even though he\u2019s not black or brown, Jeff Goldblum might be the only technically white man in Hollywood who can cosplay as the Rock and not be in blackface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mention this because in addition to Thompson and Elba, Goldblum steals the show as the Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok. Goldblum has achieved that Christopher Walken character-actor status where, at this point in his career, no matter what the role, he only plays an extreme version of his own personality and you love it anyway. Come for the black characters and Thor\u2019s humor, stay for the Jeff Goldblum monologues as Grandmaster.\n\nUnless you\u2019re auto-correcting \u201ccovfefe\u201d on your phone or planning evil, you will like Thor: Ragnarok. Is it the best Marvel movie made? Of course not. For all of the action and cinematic beauty, Ragnarok\u2019s ending is somewhat flat. It\u2019s almost as if the director had a more grandiose plan but had to cut it short to fit the movie into next year\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War. (The ending of Ragnarok seems to flow right into the first Avengers: Infinity War trailer.)\n\nPlus, we all know that the best Marvel movie ever made is Black Panther (it doesn\u2019t matter that it hasn\u2019t come out yet\u2014have you seen the trailer?). However, Thor: Ragnarok is the best Thor movie ever made, and if it turns out to be the end of a trilogy, at least this time, all genders, races and species got to come along for the ride.", "keywords": ["love", "ragnarok", "swords", "movies", "goldblum", "movie", "negroes", "black", "thor", "avengers", "marvel", "magical", "come"], "polarity": 0.15549989692846838, "subjectivity": 0.5527870542156256},

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

On Thursday, Tara Marie Solem was charged with two felony counts of impersonating an officer. It turns out that back in July, Solem was willing to risk it all for some Chick-fil-A (who among us ... ). The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was the first to report the story.\n\nAs Fox News reports, Solem \u201cat first tried to convince a drive-thru employee that she was a federal agent but was unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nDesperate for a discounted chicken sandwich, Solem refused to be deterred, going inside the restaurant and \u201c[flashing] a silver badge to two managers in a bid to persuade them that she was a federal law enforcement officer.\u201d\n\nFrom Fox News:\n\n\n\n\u201cShe stated that she was undercover and that for them asking her to be in uniform would blow her cover and [possibly] get her killed,\u201d according to the arrest warrant cited by the [Atlanta Journal-Constitution].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, give me $1 off this $5 sandwich or Imma die. Or get jail time. Whatever.

Sometimes, the criticism to the criticism goes even further, and racially-tinged epithets like coon, sellout, and negro bed wench are spat in their direction. And then the wagons already circling around the man in question become reinforced with a coat of self-righteous kevlar. They must protect and defend this man from both the racist and the intra-racial attacks on his actions and character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you've been on any predominately Black digital space this year when Lavar Ball or Umar Johnson or Bill Cosby or R. Kelly were discussed, you've undoubtedly seen it. You might have even been surprised by the number of Black people (men and women) willing to die very public and very stupid deaths on the Cosby and Kelly and Ball and Johnson hills. And, you might have been the target of their vehemence.\n\n(Before I continue, just want to make clear that there's a huge difference between what Cosby/Kelly have been accused of doing and Ball/Johnson \u2014 neither of whom, as far as I know, have been accused of heinous crimes. I put them together because they're each very high profile Black men, and the types of criticism aimed at the people who criticize them are similar.)\n\nAs someone who has been on the receiving end of the criticism of the criticism \u2014 just last week, someone on Facebook pointed to a piece I wrote about #TeamLawrence as evidence I'm ghostwriting for the Rothchilds (or something) \u2014 I'll admit that it bothers me. The names themselves don't matter much to me. You call me a coon or a sellout, and I'll shrug my shoulders and bite a pancake. My annoyance is more about their abject lack of self-awareness. While they're accusing us of being anti-Black, they're the ones allowing racial stereotypes to dictate their thoughts and actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, a common response to the criticism of Lavar Ball's ridiculous bombast is that we're trying to sabotage \"the one brotha who's standing up for his kids.\" And the \"rare Black man willing to challenge White people.\" And \"one of the only Black dads out there so active in their kids' lives.\"\n\nBut \u2014 and take this whichever way you want \u2014 Lavar aint special. Yes, his sons are special basketball players. And he has a special, Trumpian gift for shamelessness and self-promotion. But there are hundred of thousands of Black dads who stand up for their sons just like he does. And are willing to challenge White people just like he does. And are just as active in their kids' lives as he is. The only difference between Lavar Ball and literally any Black dad you can find doing Mikan drills with his son or daughter on a YMCA court today is that Lavar has a megaphone. A megaphone we only bother listening to because his sons are great players.\n\nExcusing his fuckshit and defending him as some rare and precious jewel of Black manhood and Black fatherhood implicitly agrees with the worst stereotypes about Black men and Black fathers. That we're so rare that Lavar Ball has to be handled like the Hope fucking Diamond. The same could be said about Umar Johnson. Who's defended like he's The Last Airbender, when I can personally name, right now without Google, (at least) 40 real actual Black men with real actual PhDs who are knowledgable about race and racism and unafraid to confront Whiteness and aren't misogynists and homophobes and haven't used GoFundMe donations to buy Muscle Milk and Bigen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this defense is what happens when you've allowed what the world expects of Black men to exist as your standard. You start believing the hype \u2014 insisting that A Black Man Doing A Thing is so isolated and rarefied that it's worth excusing all the terrible just to preserve the talent. And while this train of thought might possess the veneer of pro-Blackness, it's actually pervasively anti-Black, as the coddling suggests that these men aren't able to be better people. Like it's impossible for us to be talented and not terrible.\n\nAnd yea, it's true that there are countless forces out there actively trying to kill us. Police. Donald Trump. Darth Susans.

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA.

Black people\n\nSome things really need no explanation but ya know, we explain shit and shit around here. I\u2019m not, however, going to explain this shit because I mean, duh.\n\n2. The rights of anybody but white people, but especially Black people\n\nWhite man with a gun? Exercising his rights.\n\nBlack man with a gun? Infringing upon the rights of others.\n\nWhite man speaking his mind and standing up for his rights? Patriot.\n\nBlack man speaking his mind and standing up for his rights? Pariah.\n\nI think you see where I\u2019m going with that one, white man.\n\n3. Their own self interests\n\nWhite folks = Fuck Obamacare.\n\nTomi Lahren = professional white person = I\u2019m rocking the fuck out of Obamacare, my G.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObamacare isn\u2019t perfect, but I\u2019m not even sure if most of the people who hate it so much have any real idea why. If you know what a libertarian is, and you hate Obamacare, I\u2019ll trust your opinion. If not, and you\u2019re white, and you hate Obama and Obamacare, I\u2019m just going to assume you\u2019re a racist, and be extremely comfortable in my skin doing so.\n\n4. The long term health care effects of athletes\n\nGranted, this is a mostly American problem, but its ironic that the same people who hate the idea of mandatory health care are so excited about voluntary concussions. I\u2019m giving this one to white people, too, just because white folks love their football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Human lives if an animal\u2019s life is present\n\nOf course, that human life is extra easy to view in a disposable light if he or she is a person of color. But you put a rabid dog and a person of color next to each other and ask a white person which one is more valuable, I\u2019d bet GOOD money that the white person would say the rabid dog, ten times out of ten.\n\n6. America\n\nYou can\u2019t pretend to give a shit about this country after voting for Donald Trump and finding ANY true legitimacy in this clown show going on in Washington. Yet and still, I\u2019m pretty sure that white group of folks who voted for Trump absolutely think this country is in better shape than it was under Obama. White folks love to whitefolk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Any other country not named America\n\nWhite people pretty much hate the planet. Except for America. But\u2026see #6.\n\n8. Other white people as long as a Black person is fucked over\n\nI mean\u2026they shitted on welfare by making it a Black phenomenon even though stats say\u2026well, you already know this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Anybody else's culture\n\nWhite folks love to borrow our shit, Columbus it, profit off of it, and then ruin your shit. What is our shit? Pretty much anything of interest that's happened since 1620.

Seasoning on food\n\nIt's why they can't make the potato salad, deviled eggs, any kind of chicken, any kind of, well fuck it, any kind of anything.

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["styles", "braids", "using", "haircare", "scalp", "tips", "scarf", "tresses", "short", "reluctant", "enthusiast", "fitness", "oil", "protect", "head", "hair"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows. As Darius says, there\u2019s a vibe here.", "keywords": ["weird", "looks", "sense", "season", "paper", "atlanta", "glover", "waves", "robbin", "black", "stuff", "theres"], "polarity": 0.17454147160029507, "subjectivity": 0.494668893198305},

Even though every time I\u2019m there it\u2019s cold and hot and wet and generally smells like a lit candle stuck in a pigeon\u2019s ass, I never actually hated New York City. I just felt uneasy, awkward and overwhelmed. Basically, visiting New York City is like watching Funny Games.\n\nBut in the past couple of years, I\u2019ve come to appreciate certain characteristics of it that I had overlooked\u2014stuff that New Yorkers themselves perhaps don\u2019t even realize is unique to their city. Behold, below, a short list of these things:\n\n1. Uber drivers don\u2019t talk to you.\n\nPerhaps this is just something that happens with me. Maybe everyone else gets litigators and LaVar Balls as their drivers, or maybe the drivers I get intuit \u201cThis nigga must be an INTJ\u201d and instinctively avoid small talk with me. Either way, I get in the car, they say, \u201cDamon?\u201d and I say, \u201cYup.\u201d And the next words said are at the end of the ride, with me saying, \u201cThank you\u201d and them saying, \u201cFive stars, please\u201d\u2014a stark contrast to the drivers in Pittsburgh, who want to talk about the weather and my dreams and shit. Fuck the weather and my dreams, please.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Y\u2019all have all of the clothes!\n\nI have thighs and man-ass. Which was great for basketball and football because it allowed me to mine power and a favorable vertical leap from them, but it sucks when trying to find pants that fit and are fashionable. For instance, Levi\u2019s 522s were a godsend for me. Until those bastards discontinued them. And then tried to rebrand them as 512s. Which are ... eh, but workable.\n\nBut the only place you can find a nice selection of Levi\u2019s in Pittsburgh is Macy\u2019s, which often might not have your size or the color you want. And then your only option is the internet, which ... who really wants to order jeans on the fucking internet? But in New York? Shit. There, you can go to the Levi\u2019s flagship store with all the damn Levi\u2019s. It\u2019s Levi\u2019s bukkake. You might even share an Uber with Frank Levi\u2014or whatever the fuck the guy who invented Levi\u2019s name is\u2014himself. The same dynamic exists with all other types of clothes\u2014suits, shoes, shirts, whatever. There are so many stores\u2014including flagships\u2014with such large inventories that you can always find what you need. And shit you didn\u2019t know you needed (and probably don\u2019t) until you saw it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. You see famous people doing genuinely unfamous-people shit.\n\nI was at lunch with my agent on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side Thursday afternoon, and I happened to glance out of a window and saw a vaguely familiar and impossibly cute young woman walking past. She was wearing sweats and a parka and looked to be carrying a bag, and looked like she\u2019d just left yoga and/or was headed to Trader Joe\u2019s or some other mundane unfamous-people shit. After a couple of seconds, the reason she was vaguely familiar dawned on me: It was Zazie Beetz\u2014Van from Atlanta. (I\u2019m 99.9 percent certain it was her, at least.)\n\nAgain, if this were Pittsburgh, it would be HOLY FUCKING SHIT, THAT\u2019S THAT FAMOUS PERSON FROM THAT SHOW. And if that famous person did happen to be in Pittsburgh, he or she would likely be there to do some famous-person shit. Like, Denzel Washington might be here to film a movie or speak on a panel. But you ain\u2019t gonna see his ass at a Pittsburgh Applebee\u2019s. On Thursday, however, it was just \u201cOh ... a famous person in a city where all of the famous people live. Hi, Zazie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It forces you to walk everywhere ... which forces you to stay in shape.\n\nAlthough I try to hit the gym as much as possible, much of my life is sedentary. I sit all day and write at coffee shops, bars and my office. When I need to go somewhere, I drive. And yes, playing basketball regularly helps, but it sometimes feels like an artificial injection of exercise and adrenaline to replace what I\u2019m missing from staying still for so much of the day.\n\nIn New York City, however, everywhere is a fucking hike. Blocks are miles-long. And to get from A to B on the sidewalk, you have to hurdle bags of trash. You even have to trek to get to public transportation\u2014and trek some more when you get off of it\u2014which is stupid and paradoxical, but whatever. But all of this movement keeps you energized and keeps your blood warm. Which is great because you need to be in great shape to run from all the rats.", "keywords": ["things", "underrated", "nyc", "famous", "drivers", "used", "talk", "pittsburgh", "hate", "levis", "need", "doesnt", "city", "guy", "york", "person", "shit"], "polarity": 0.05836989586989587, "subjectivity": 0.5844064719064721},

Especially cooking. Food has always been a source of comfort and therapy for us. It brings us closer together during life\u2019s worst, grandest and most lit moments.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a foodie and a kick-ass cook, if I can boast for a minute. Technically, I should call myself a chef. I do always pick the appropriate ingredients to pair with the sometimes edible monstrosities that rear their ugly heads in the food baskets on Chopped. Also, I have prepared jackfruit salsa and shrimp tacos, and they were BOMB.\n\nI am fairly open to eating many foods as well. Hell, I\u2019ve even had tarantula. Don\u2019t judge me. It tastes like fluffy crab, but it\u2019s not as firm as lobster meat.\n\nWith that said, there are certain \u201cblack foods\u201d that are overrated as fuck. I can legit do without them. And seeing people\u2019s reactions and hearing them try to convince me that somehow \u201cI can\u2019t be doing it right\u201d is hella amusing.\n\nHere are five foods that should be bound to hell (in my Cardi B voice) FUH-EVAH!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Fried Chicken Skin\n\nFried chicken skin is gross. It\u2019s like somebody\u2019s Big Mama jacked Leatherface\u2019s mask, fried it until it was extra crunchy and then wrapped it around juicy, well-seasoned meat. And telling black folks that you don\u2019t partake in the consumption of fried chicken skin is like telling them you drink beer with a straw.\n\nIt makes me want to gag, and seeing chicken skin raw doesn\u2019t help. Jesus be a fence around that film that\u2019s between the skin and the meat. I can\u2019t do it. I peel the skin off completely, season, batter and then fry. It\u2019s the only way to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it\u2019s still crunchy.\n\n4. Runny-Ass Egg Yolks\n\nThe fuckery of breakfast foods. The consumption of runny egg yolks is done by people who eat after not washing their hands before leaving the bathroom. And watching \u201cthose people\u201d sopping their wheat toast and jelly into a salmonella smoothie like it\u2019s milk and cookies makes my stomach turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho thought that THIS should be a thing, and why do people follow it?\n\n3. Gravy\n\nGravy originated in Europe during the 16th century. It was made from meat fat, where it was rendered, thickened and served with bread or potatoes. I can only guess that Dwights grew weary of eating seasonless meat and bland-ass potatoes. You can only do so much with a big-ass turkey leg and full side of beef or lamb, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack folks \u201cperfected\u201d gravy, however, with food that\u2019s already been seasoned and blessed by the hands of Black Jesus in your favorite auntie\u2019s kitchen; we don\u2019t really need it. It\u2019s a distraction ... and it\u2019s thick. As fuck.\n\nDo black people even eat shepherd\u2019s pie and Yorkshire pudding?\n\nBesides, making the other food on the plate, which DOESN\u2019T require gravy, wet ain\u2019t the business. Soggy-ass biscuits AIN\u2019T THE BUSINESS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Any Kind of Meat in Greens\n\nNegroes SWEAR by ham hocks, turkey necks or wings in greens.\n\n#ALLMEATSDONTMATTER\n\nI grew up eating meat in collards and turnip greens, and I\u2019ve always hated it. I don\u2019t want to have an MMA fighting match with bones and shit when I am trying to make a love connection in my belly between greens and cornbread.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBaby, what is you doing?\u201d\n\nMeat isn\u2019t needed to re-create a smoky or earthy flavor, which is why meat is, supposedly, added in the first place. The same result can be achieved by adding a spice like cumin. It works. TRUST ME! Remember, I competed on Chopped (in my head).\n\nAnd last but not least ... the food that can kick rocks for eternity unless served with colossal prawns, scallions, bacon pieces and cheese:\n\n1. Grits\n\nGrits are one of the most overrated and debated foods to grow on God\u2019s green earth, and they can rest eternally in the trash\u2014especially if you are dousing those shits with sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, I said it.\n\nIt\u2019s a legitimate waste of perfectly savory corn on the cob. I mean, farina is what grits wanted to be but didn\u2019t quite pull off. The Ray J to Brandy, if you will, of ground milled grains.\n\nIt is the staple of every black mama\u2019s breakfast, and unfortunately, there are many black mamas, so as a kid ... I couldn\u2019t avoid them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI thank God for becoming an adult. I don\u2019t have to be subjected to eating this gah-bage ever again.

I get the hell out of it. I get the shit out of it. I get it so much it hurts. And I don\u2019t get everything. Shit, I don\u2019t even get most things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, I don\u2019t get why the orange juice McDonald\u2019s gives you for breakfast tastes 75 percent better than the rest of the orange juice I\u2019ve ever tasted\u2014even though I know it\u2019s nothing but Simply Orange juice, which I know because I\u2019ve literally seen them pour the Simply Orange juice into my cup before.\n\nI also don\u2019t get why, in the chorus of \u201cDipset Anthem,\u201d Juelz Santana says he\u2019s \u201cwatching Shaft\u201d and \u201cclocking math,\u201d because those seem like very time- and attention-consuming activities by themselves.\n\nBut I get why, as a response to H&M\u2019s creation of an ad featuring a young black boy in a monkey hoodie, we turned him into Prince Akeem. And I get why, as a response to President Donald Trump referring to African nations, Haiti and El Salvador as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d we tweet-stormed the LinkedIn pages of every Nigerian-American Facebook friend with an MBA and an Audi. And I definitely get that part of the excitement with Black Panther is us watching black nobility kick ass and also having the opportunity to outfit ourselves in Negro Dungeons & Dragons cosplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis deification of kingdom and queendom is a natural response to a culture that devalues and dehumanizes us at every turn. And also, for those who\u2019ve internalized this dehumanization\u2014which, to be fair, is probably all of us to some degree\u2014it\u2019s a way of reminding ourselves that our histories and our peoples didn\u2019t begin at slavery and haven\u2019t always been as vulnerable.\n\nBut I just wish that those who choose to do this would just, well, stop doing it. Because kingdoms and queendoms are nothing to aspire to. Because as history has taught us, if you happened to exist in a place where there were kings and queens\u2014and the kings and queens had actual power\u2014and you weren\u2019t part of that ruling class, your life probably sucked. Because that\u2019s just what usually happens in places ruled by autocrats.\n\nAlso\u2014and most importantly\u2014putting all of your metaphysical eggs into the \u201cWe were kings\u201d basket willfully ignores the fact that most people are not descendants of kings. That\u2019s just not how kingdoms work! (Unless, of course, you\u2019re from one of those countries where the king had many, um, partners. In which case, your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-uncle might have been the black Ramsay Snow. Congratulations.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not saying this to devalue anyone\u2019s lineage. I\u2019m actually attempting to do the opposite. If your ancestors were farmers or goat herders or tree cutters or hut builders or chicken-feather pluckers\u2014which, again, they probably were\u2014they deserve just as much reverence (if not more) as any sort of hypothetical nobility.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with just being from some normal-ass and decent people? People who lived and loved and fought and hurt and sang and cried and dreamed and experienced and exhibited the full breadth of humanity? I mean, shit. Have you ever tried to herd a goat? I haven\u2019t, but I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s much harder than sitting on a platinum throne and having eunuchs feed you seedless grapes.\n\nAnd, well, this fetishization of power and noble lineage and pure bloodlines does nothing but mirror the oppressive and subjugating systems and mind states we should be attempting to destroy, not mimic. It\u2019s basically \u201cMAGA\u201d with dashikis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, though, I get it. I really do. I just wish that we (well, some of us) weren\u2019t so quick to defend and define our humanity and our worth with castles and crowns. But maybe that\u2019s just me.

As of late, I\u2019ve heard quite a few mixed-to-negative feelings about the upcoming DETROIT film from native Detroiters, so my first goal when touching down at Detroit Metro Airport on a paid press junket for the film was to figure out why so many people are taking umbrage.\n\nThe very first person I asked was the Lyft driver \u2013 a brother just a few years older than me \u2013 who took me from the airport to my hotel. He was concerned that DETROIT \u2013 a film centered around the racially motivated five-day rebellion in July 1967 that resulted in more than 40 deaths and thousands of destroyed buildings \u2013 might disrupt relations between native black folks and the city\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d white people, who are ostensibly at the helm of the city\u2019s \u201crevival\u201d that people have been waiting for since I was pushing a big wheel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the driver\u2019s behalf, I asked DETROIT screenwriter Mark Boal during a press conference with the cast and creators of the film if he and director Kathryn Bigelow had given thought to how such an inherently incendiary film would be received by an increasingly gentrifying Detroit. He admitted that he doesn\u2019t know much about the Detroit of 2017, reinforcing that the story itself needed to be told. \u201cA lot of people from [Detroit] don\u2019t know the story even if they grew up here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s true in Detroit, it\u2019s certainly true elsewhere.\u201d\n\nAs I wait with bated breath for the movie\u2019s Aug. 4 wide release so everyone can see and discuss it, I\u2019ve zero doubt that DETROIT will anger many \u2013 especially black folks \u2013 for what will likely be several different reasons. In the film, the \u201967 rebellion serves as a backdrop for the so-called Algiers Motel incident, where three black boys were killed, and seven black males and two white women were brutalized in one night by white officers from the Detroit and Michigan State police departments, as well as the Michigan Army National Guard.\n\nThe film depicts a borderline torture-porn degree of brutality that puts it in the company of films like Rosewood and 12 Years a Slave, in that will make you want to go into the office the morning after watching and push fucking Todd in accounting with his fucking chinos and fucking tucked-in Polo shirt out of the motherfucking plate-glass window on the 12th floor. I have a strong constitution for hard-to-watch movies, but even I had to pass my ticket to the world premiere off since there was no way in the name of Vishnu that I would sit through it twice in three days. There were many shed tears and some walk-outs at the screening I attended. It\u2019s rough like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor us native Detroiters, there\u2019ll certainly be an element of aggravation at the fact that there\u2019s an eponymous movie representing the city in such a harsh, if historical, light, considering that the media has spent years portraying Detroit like its Mogadishu in the early 1990s. Sure, it\u2019s a historical film depicting events from 50 years ago, but Detroiters are fiercely defensive people and this is just another thing that will make us want to throw hands at shit-talking outsiders.\n\nThere are numerous moments throughout DETROIT that might anger viewers less in a pre-Mike Brown zeitgeist: There\u2019s the depiction of a police officer under investigation for murder who is allowed back on the street in active duty. There are the while girls boldly flapping their gums to white police officers under the (correct) assumption that they will, indeed, survive the night. There\u2019s also a white savior component to the film that will rankle some people; sure, very few people believe that all white police officers are evil, but the portrayal of sympathetic white cops will certainly make people feel Some Type of Way\u2122 less than two months after the acquittal of Philando Castile\u2019s killer.\n\nFolks have also made noise about the lack of black women in the DETROIT cast \u2013 even I was surprised when I couldn\u2019t find one in the press materials. Samira Wiley pops up looking fly for about seven seconds, and every other sista in the film pops up in a SAG-AFTRA minimum-rate capacity. However, Black women simply weren\u2019t present at the Algiers Motel during the incident. Considering the film\u2019s brutal content, we shouldn\u2019t want black women to be unnecessarily injected into that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the aforementioned issues dovetail into one of the film\u2019s chief critiques: should Bigelow and Boal, both white, be the ones to tell such a racially charged story? Some believe that protracted police brutality against black men is a bit voyeuristic when viewed through a white lens, and have increased strictures against the filmmakers\u2019 every decision as a result. Was the black kid getting beat that harshly in real life? Or did these white folks just do it for effect?\n\nWhen asked about this at the press conference, Bigelow said she had a very \u201clengthy conversation with myself\u201d before taking on the movie. \u201cThis story needed to be told, and that kind of overrode any other hesitation,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018I have this platform and opportunity, and the story needs to see the light of day.\u2019 I took advantage of that while, at the same time, realizing it\u2019s a concern and challenge.\u201d\n\nLike Bigelow, I believe that someone needs to tell the story\u2026especially considering that, like Boal said, many native Detroiters don\u2019t know much about the \u201967 rebellion. The extent of my own verbal history lesson was my mother explaining that, when she was 14-year-old, my grandmother had to threaten death to her and her siblings if they even thought of running to 12th Street to get a \u201cfree\u201d television like the neighbors across the street did. Would it have been better for John Singleton or a Hughes brother or Ava Duvernay to tackle the story\u2026? Perhaps, but that would require waiting around for a story that may never actually get told on screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStepping back from the list of gripes, if the Algiers Motel incident had to be filmed by a white director, I\u2019m glad it was Bigelow. I will forever be a Point Break stan, and DETROIT contains some of the same masterful directing and sound editing that created the near-masochistic levels of tension she employed in her Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker.\n\nThe set, mostly shot in and around Boston, actually resembles Detroit; Motown music is used to great effect, and the acting should generate Oscar buzz: Algee Smith, who played Ralph Tresvant in The New Edition Story, serves as the film\u2019s emotional center and is destined to be a true star. And, because he does such an amazing job, you\u2019ll truly despise every hair on the comically arched eyebrows of Will Poulter\u2019s Philip Krauss, the film\u2019s primary antagonist. (The British actor is actually extremely genteel in person.)\n\nI won\u2019t dismiss as unjustifiable the inevitable firestorm of polarizing opinions about DETROIT. But my primary concern is that viewers \u2013 especially non-black ones \u2013 don\u2019t leave the theater thinking that the half-century-old true story it depicts is ancient history and outside of the realm of reality in a 2017 in which our president marginalized an entire fucking minority group with his Twitter fingers this week. The Ford Galaxie 500 police cruisers in the film may have been updated to Ford Fusions, and the \u201cboys\u201d and hard-r \u201cniggers\u201d not uttered as liberally by cops. But it takes little more than a glance at the national news on any given day to realize that racial relations among police and black folks have a long way to go.", "keywords": ["women", "recommend", "films", "press", "detroit", "understand", "bigelow", "cant", "movie", "white", "native", "black", "film", "true"], "polarity": 0.060585945165945176, "subjectivity": 0.4361127272727271},

OK.\n\nThe sweatshirt image caught the attention of New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow and prompted an instant uproar. Many threatened to boycott the Swedish chain after seeing the disturbing advertisement. Flocks of customers took to Twitter and Facebook voicing their concerns, demanding that the image be pulled down; others remained on the fence about H&M\u2019s intentions, claiming that the European retailer may be out of touch on such a loaded topic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of \u201cmonkey\u201d as a racist term has a deplorable history, dating back to the 1570s with the fable of a Portuguese woman being raped by an African ape and being forced to have its babies.\n\nInevitably, some will ignore that loaded history and argue that we live in an overly sensitive society where everything is offensive. And sure, we could simply blame this on poor judgment by H&M\u2019s marketing department. But that\u2019s a tough sell for Black Twitter, which isn\u2019t inclined to forgive so easily.

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

Black Justin Bieber pitted against Paper Boi in the celebrity basketball game, calling for the ball and unsuccessfully trying to get his teammate's attention with \"Nigga! Nigga!\" And then, fed up that he's being ignored, breaking for a split second and just saying \"Nigger!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The keys left in the front door of Van's apartment, discovered by Van during her high and hungover morning after hanging out with her homegirl the night before\n\n3. Van's politely and excitedly dismissive \"thank you\" to the prosperity pastor complimenting her looks during the Juneteenth celebration\n\nNone of these, of course, are important moments in the show. Each of these scenes could have been edited out, and absolutely nothing about Atlanta or my feelings about it would have changed much. I'd even guess that some who've seen each episode don't remember any of these moments. They each took approximately one second of screen time, and I would have missed them too if I happened to use one of those moments to edit a tweet or retwist the cap on my bottled water or even laugh a bit too hard at the scene before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the creation, inclusion, and culmination of moments like these is why Atlanta, after just one season, is already my favorite show on TV. It's a show that rewards the audience \u2014 and by \"the audience\" I mean \"the Black people who comprise the target audience\" \u2014 for paying attention. And not with obnoxious Easter Eggs or wall-breaking asides or even needless and patronizing exposition. But with details. Inspired and ambitious consideration to mundanities that communicate that the people creating this show are also paying attention. And, most importantly, that they respect the audience enough to be honest and to recreate reality as best as they possibly can \u2014 with occasional infusions of surreality and absurdity \u2014 because they know we'll appreciate it. I can imagine a different show either not thinking to include the shot of the keys in the door or editing it out; thinking it wouldn't matter or that we wouldn't notice something so inconsequential. But Atlanta appreciates us, values us, wants to impress us, and loves us, and I appreciate that appreciation.\n\nThis level of care permeates and bleeds into every aspect of the show, including perhaps its most obvious and conspicuous characteristic \u2014 its actors. Much has already been said about how each of the four main characters (Donald Glover's Earnest \"Earn\" Marks, Brian Tyree Henry's Alfred \"Paper Boi\" Miles, Keith Stanfield's Darius, and Zazie Beetz's Vanessa \"Van\" Keefer) were perfectly cast, but even that laud still undersells how accurate they were. Because each of them also looked exactly how they're supposed to look. Those of us who have known Earns in our lives \u2014 and those of us who might even have been (or might still be) Earn \u2014 know that a person like Earn would look and talk and dress and move and sound and be like Donald Glover's Earn. The same could be said about Darius and Paper Boi. You did not have to suspend reality; no time spent convincing yourself of their authenticity or reminding yourself to forget that neither of them quite look the part or fit. It's a show about working class and somewhat crime adjacent niggas in Atlanta, and they managed to cast people who look like they could be working class and somewhat crime adjacent niggas in Atlanta.\n\nEven Zazie Beetz's Van looks exactly like someone who'd be with Earn and would have had enough in common with someone like Earn to have a child with him. Although she possesses characteristics that would allow her to fit certain Hollywood beauty standards \u2014 a fact that's alluded to several times in the show \u2014 her aesthetic is more Busboys and Poets than bourgeois. Or, better yet, more Afropunk than Essence Festival. Which helps make her character and her relationship make sense. (I realize these are imperfect analogies, but I trust you get what I'm attempting to describe.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta, of course, isn't a perfect show. But it desperately wants to be and its making every effort to be. It wants to get us right. And wants us to notice it; for us to love it as much as it loves us. And for us to recognize it for what it is; a perfectly imperfect paean to Black people.", "keywords": ["best", "love", "wants", "audience", "look", "van", "donald", "atlanta", "paper", "important", "boi", "glovers", "black", "moments", "earn", "letter"], "polarity": 0.19925141242937855, "subjectivity": 0.4755871670702179},

So, basically it\u2019s a conversation that proclaims, We schaid what we schaid.\n\n\n\nEverybody and their mamas have either seen or have plans to see What the Health, a documentary on Netflix that has made the meatiest meat eater give up on meat. (Folks have also seen countless videos of police brutality and killings of black folks, but they still don\u2019t think black lives matter; but I digress.) I mention the documentary with the cult following because now, more than ever, health is at the forefront and most of us are eating our vegetables without even being told to. But if we\u2019re really being honest with ourselves, then we\u2019ll admit that some healthy food sucks\u2014especially the kind masquerading as something it\u2019s just not.\n\nThis week The Root\u2019s managing editor, Danielle Belton, made this statement: \u201cName a food (stereotypically) black people like to eat, and I either cooked it or ate it.\u201d So of course I start naming foods that a majority of the world would agree are \u201cblack,\u201d things like hog maws, collards, turkey wings, gizzards, corn bread, watermelon. And then it began:\n\n\n\nEvan Narcisse: **Waits for cheddar bay biscuits.**\n\nDanielle Belton: When I worked in an office [in] D.C., I ate watermelon with my lunch almost every day, and I didn\u2019t care what anyone thought about it. You can\u2019t food-shame me. It\u2019s not possible. Everyone likes these foods! They\u2019re delicious!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation turned to all the nonblack things Yesha Callahan does and eats, and then Danielle Belton dropped a thought we were all thinking: And even vegans are like, \u201cLemme have these chik-n-patties that kind of taste like fried chicken.\u201d\n\n\n\nDanielle Young: LOL vegans SWEARRR! The worst is their bleeding-ass plant-based burgers. WHY?!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGita Jackson: I dated a vegan anarchist for like a year, and I have no idea how i lasted that long. Trying to make candied yams with Earth Balance.\n\nKatharine Trendacosta: Of the fake meats, chicken fake meat is the best.\n\nDanielle Young: No fake meat is good lol. Fake anything sucks.\n\nKatharine Trendacosta: Oh, it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s just the best.\n\nAnd leave it to Yesha to drag more innocent vegetables! In cauliflower\u2019s defense, I think it\u2019s a solid veggie, but why is everyone always trying to dress it up as something else?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesha Callahan: Ohh, then trying to masquerade cauliflower as everything but cauliflower: \u201cHere, try some of my cauliflower buffalo wings.\u201d\n\nEven though I actually do eat cauliflower rice and I do enjoy cauliflower as buffalo wings, I get annoyed with how much people want to dress up vegetables. Are we trying to pretend we\u2019re not eating vegetables? Vegetables are good! Well, some of them (according to Yesha).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesha Callahan: Some vegetables are great.\n\nDanielle Belton: Vegetables pretending to not be vegetables = awful.\n\nAnd leave it to Yesha to drop the bomb of all bombs.

Don\u2019t eat okra at all.\n\nAnd in comes Jezebel\u2019s Clover Hope late to the conversation, but in defense of okra.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClover Hope: Okra is the best when cooked right.

Maybe whatever that eats eels will because ... slimy.\n\nAnother latecomer\u2014this time, from Splinter.\n\n\n\nIsha Aran: Holy shit, I did not think okra would tear this room apart. On that note, team okra for life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP.J. Rickards: Y\u2019all don\u2019t like fried okra?\n\nDanielle Young: I like fried everything.

And then Belton invited us to her apartment, where she\u2019d cook all the blackest foods. I think it was a rather productive conversation.

Her premise \u2014 and this is one several agents, authors, and editors agree with \u2014 was that the news coming out of Washington has been so bizarre and ridiculous and absurd that we (collectively) haven't had as much of a need to read fiction for entertainment. Also, the perpetual diarrhea stream of Trump-related stories has so dominated the news cycle that there isn't as much space for anything else.\n\n\n\nMonika Woods, a literary agent at Curtis Brown LTD, said that amid the rapid news cycle from fall of 2016 to early 2017, \u201cFiction writers were booked on \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 and they had to be rebooked and rebooked and rebooked. Even New York Times bestselling authors with books out in Fall 2016 struggled.\u201d Industry insiders noted that Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Here I Am and James Gleick\u2019s Time Travel: A History, for example, failed to meet sales expectations, even though both authors had their previous novels on the New York Times Bestsellers List. Sarah Bowlin, former editor at Henry Holt and current literary agent at Aevitas Creative Management, echoed Woods\u2019s thoughts, saying, \u201cWhen you have a news day of four different revelations, there\u2019s less room in a cultural conversation to talk about a debut or bestselling author.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Fortunately, this has resulted in a hypervisibility for Black and Brown writers, as, to quote Jerkins, \"the same identities that are being persecuted and demonized by the Trump administration are finding a warm welcome from an increasingly diverse literary audience that is eager to hear vulnerable voices.\")\n\nAnd then, literally seconds after I finished reading that, I clicked on and read Anthony Scaramucci's Mooch Eruption in The New Yorker, demonstratively proving the truth of everything Jerkins said. How the fuck are authors supposed to compete with a freakin White House communications director who leaks every fucking thing to a reporter while calling him to bitch about and expose leakers? I will never say or write anything more compelling and ridiculous and hilarious than \"I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\" (Which might actually be the way I introduce myself to people from now on. The next time someone shakes my hand and asks my name, I'm going to say \"I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\")\n\nAnyway, the most interesting revelation in the Mooch's rant (to me at least) is one I've had for months now. The men of the White House are obsessed with penises. Engrossed with wangs. Bedeviled with cocks. Bewitched with dicks. All of their policies and beliefs reflect this dick-obsessed world view. They want to ban transgender people from the military. And remove sex education from schools. And make gay men go through intensive reeducation camps, like learning how not to be gay is like training to be a yogi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, naturally, is par for the course for the right. As a working and active obsession with what people decide to do with their penises and vaginas is the second question on the conservative questionnaire, right after \"(fill in the blank) Lives Matter.\" But what makes the particular brand of charlatans and chickenhawks currently in the White House special (well, special-er) is that they're obsessed with each other's dick's too! There's Anthony Scaramucci sharing that Steve Bannon must have had his ribs removed or something and giving us the WORST. IMAGERY. EVER. There's \"Reince Penis\" \u2014 which apparently is the White House inner-sanctum nickname for Reince Priebus. (And what I will refer to him as for the rest of my days.) And there's The Ribless Wonder himself, Steve Bannon, who reportedly called Paul Ryan a \"limp dicked motherfucker\" and whose favorite insult is \"cuck\" \u2014 a transparently racist term derived from a porn genre where White husbands watch their wives have sex with well-endowed Black men. These men have balls on the brain! Cock on the conscience! Their medulla oblongatas are peaking with peckers!\n\nOf course, there are many possible reasons for their wang infatuations. Including one that reminds me of the time my inspection stickers were expired and I rode dirty for like three weeks and, because I was so self-conscious about my own substandard sticker, suddenly became obsessed with everyone else's. I had severe inspection sticker envy. And maybe they're obsessed with dicks because they're dicks themselves. Sentient penises with crackling foreskins writing policy and enacting laws. (No one has looked more like an 80-year-old's, swinging-happy-and-free-in-the-YMCA-locker-room flaccid wang than Steve Bannon.)\n\nWho knows?

Stay strong and find motivation.\u201d Two years ago, I applied this same perspective to pole dancing. I transitioned from joking about having two left feet to signing up for a pole dancing course; I left feeling excited and hopeful.\n\n\n\nBefore long, I performed in a pole dancing showcase in the middle of marathon and obstacle-course training, as another demonstration of my athleticism. But despite my sense of pride, rampant stigmas about the sport persist. I\u2019ve experienced everything from being told that it\u2019s too \u201cprovocative\u201d to being personally reminded that I am a parent who needs to \u201cmaintain my integrity.\u201d To debunk a few stereotypes about this highly athletic activity, I spoke with five fierce pole athletes about their experiences as instructors, performers and students.\n\n1. Ashley Fox\n\nAshley Fox, owner and pole sport instructor of Foxy Fitness & Pole in New York City and New Jersey, is a powerhouse who\u2019s earned numerous accolades from competitions across the world. Her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes several pole dancing competitions, including the 2016 Paragon Championship. She was subsequently first runner-up in the 2017 Pole Olympia Championship. She will be holding workshops at the International Pole Convention and Pole Expo in late 2018.\n\nDespite her gymnastics, dance and cheerleading background, Fox found her athleticism in pole training. \u201cPole is the best because it combines elements from all forms of fitness and dance. The challenge of mastering strength, flexibility and dance really maximizes your physical ability,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore pole, I just felt like my body was regular; now I feel strong and feminine. I see myself as a beauty beast.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Yumiko Harris\n\nFox\u2019s general manager and pole sport instructor Yumiko Harris shared similar sentiments about the intense sport. Harris, a contemporary-dance graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, went through an artistic freeze after being burned-out by college. Before becoming the 2017 Northeast Pole Championship first place winner, she even experienced a stint of depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough a cousin\u2019s encouragement, she signed up for her first pole class. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intrigued by the appeal of bringing on your sexy,\u201d Harris says. Despite her self-proclaimed lackluster first experience, she left feeling invigorated about dancing again.\n\nAfter researching the requirements of becoming a pole dancing instructor, she took a leap of faith, leaving Chicago and pursuing a career as an instructor at Fox\u2019s New York City studio. \u201cPole dancing is empowering to the mind, body and soul because it\u2019s an individual or team sport,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIt creates that community of women becoming stronger together, not through sexuality but strength. We\u2019ve come so far now with pole sport that they\u2019re pushing it into the Olympics.\u201d\n\n3. Veronica Jamison\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllustrator Veronica Jamison took a similar route, letting her interest lead her to becoming an instructor. Jamison, a pole dance instructor at Pole Haus in Philadelphia, went from taking pole classes once or twice a week to embarking on a teacher-training program just months after enrollment. Despite her recreational dancer background, she sometimes felt out of place being a curvy plus-size woman.\n\n\u201cI have been a curvy woman my entire adult life,\u201d Jamison says. \u201cPole dancing has been instrumental in me getting over my body image issues. It really made me appreciate my body, transitioning from wanting to change it to getting into the mold of being marveled at for what it can do. Before I started pole dancing, I was really self-conscious about my body\u2014the fact that I work in fashion didn\u2019t help. Being around my pole family, seeing others not self-conscious about their bodies or passing judgment, helped me appreciate what I can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten feedback like, \u2018What is your husband saying?\u2019 And if people have something to say about it, they have their own assumptions about it. It\u2019s not my job to convince them why I do it,\u201d she adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Tina Powell\n\nActress and pole dancer Tina Powell has been teaching for a little over a year at the Choreography House in North Hollywood and Evolve Pole Dance in Los Angeles. She admits that like many, her perception of pole dancing was initially askew:\n\nI came to pole dancing accidentally by winning a free class. I never would\u2019ve tried it otherwise. I am generally an open-minded person and feel women can do as they please with their bodies, as long as no one is harmed. Yet I used to have reservations about stripping and pole dancing. I assumed exotic dancers must have emotional issues [and] low self-esteem and standards if they were \u201cselling sex\u201d and their bodies. Because of these misconceptions, I never saw the draw to pole dancing as a hobby, and I certainly didn\u2019t think of it as a sport. I realize now that pole dancing is not necessarily about sexuality. There are so many different styles of pole, though I prefer the sensual type. But I know when I dance, I\u2019m never thinking about sex or that unsolicited dick pic. Rather, pole dancing is about letting go of self-judgment, and moving with purpose. A huge part of a woman\u2019s power is in her sensuality. That power intimidates many men and makes them feel a need to shame us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Roz Mays\n\nConversely, National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and 10-year pole dancer Roz \u201cthe Diva\u201d Mays doesn\u2019t have a dancer background. \u201cMy first class was disaster dot com,\u201d she says. \u201cI love to dance and I have a Beyonc\u00e9 complex. I remember coming home thinking it\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and it\u2019s still the hardest sport I\u2019ve done, but I love it.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t have preconceptions about the activity, she took it on as a hobby through a class offered at Crunch Gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through different periods of my own style where I want to be Black Swan, and other times where I want to dance like Black Chyna,\u201d Mays continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that we\u2019re a bunch of hos or wannabe strippers. We\u2019re actually not\u2014and shoutout to strippers, because they work 10 times harder than we do.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Mays is no stranger to hazing from the internet:\n\nPeople think that me doing a sport at my size is promoting obesity. There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything that people can write about me on the internet that\u2019s worse than anything that I said about myself. When people call me fat, ugly or a man, it\u2019s still 10 times nicer than the things that I said. Before poling, I thought I was disgusting beyond belief. There was no relationship between me and my body. After pole, I am starting to heal. Never once in my lifetime have I embraced my body. People make that assumption and it\u2019s not true\u2014I have a better view of myself physically, but I have 30 years of damage, and it\u2019s going to take some years to reverse it. For the first four or five years, I thought I was too big to wear pole shorts. When I did get the guts, it was like the weight of the world lifted off of my shoulders. I remember the first class that I did that six years ago; I cried until my eyes were swimming on my bed. It was a relief cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the board, all five instructors strongly urged potential students to attend just one class. Neither sweaty palms nor a lack of upper body strength serves as an excuse to avoid trying. Instead, be consistent and present and learn the foundation. Regardless of your shape, size, gender or disability, you should feel comfortable coming to class.

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

Call me back at the God hour.\" You'd walk in and the entire wait staff would be past-their-prime rappers. Lady of Rage and Bahamadia would be the hostesses, Redman, U-God, and Black Rob the servers, Spliff Star, Grand Puba, and Amil the cooks, and Raekwon the Chef would be the actual head chef. The menu would be filled with nods to that era. Perhaps you might be in the mood for the Ol' Dirty Rice Bowl. Or maybe the Master Peas and Gravy. If really hungry, you could even get the What's Roast Beef? with your DMXtra Spicy Wing Dings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe skit wouldn't actually air on TV. After filming it, they'd realize its one of those instances where the idea behind the skit is better than the actual skit, and would cut it from the episode. But it would find a life on that season's DVD box set; included with other bits that didn't make the cut.\n\nOf course, White people seem intent on proving they're able to create realities far more absurd and ridiculous than any fiction. Which is why East Liberty \u2014 which used to be a Black Pittsburgh cultural nexus but is rapidly morphing into Yinzer Williamsburg \u2014 will soon be home to \"The Coop,\" which promises to be an \"urban, street style type of place\" serving fast casual fried chicken, according to Adam Kucenic (the owner). It will sit next to Muddy Waters, an oyster bar created by the same owner. And on Muddy Waters' other side will soon be another Kucenic creation: \"The Big Kahuna\" \u2014 a poke bowl restaurant with a distinctly Hawaiian feel.\n\nThat said, this is a free-ish country. (For the time being at least.) And there's nothing inherently wrong with a White person launching a fried chicken spot in a still mostly Black neighborhood. Plus, fried chicken's stereotypical connection to Black people has never not been the most peculiar stereotype ever because 1) loving fried chicken isn't a bad thing and 2) everyone loves fried chicken because 3) fried chicken is fucking awesome. If aliens ever discovered and landed on Earth, I'm one hundred percent certain their first Earth meal would be an extra crispy three piece and a biscuit. And then they'd forget about their whole interplanetary domination and colonization plan and just leave Earth and take all of our chickens with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut remember way back when? When you first read the title of this piece, and said \"Wait. Um\u2026WTF?\" And then read some more just to make sure that the sheer absurdity of the title reflected a thing that was actually happening? Those feelings exist because you're aware of that historical connection between Black people and fried chicken. And you're also aware of the salmagundi of racially, culturally, and politically charged feelings that exist whenever Black residents and businesses are displaced or priced out of historically Black neighborhoods. And that context allowed you to immediately instinctively recognize that the concept behind that restaurant in that specific location is a terribly insensitive idea.\n\n\"Why\" you probably thought to yourself \"would anyone think that was cool?\"\n\nThat thought was likely followed by another thought:\n\n\"There was no friend or partner or whatever of the owner who heard about the idea and told him that maybe he should reconsider? That, even if his intentions where good, the optics and the reaction to those optics wouldn't be worth it? No one???\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenever something like this happens, there's a tendency to dismiss the act as tone deaf. This is perhaps the most optimistic way of assessing these situations, as it implies that the person's heart was in the right place, but they're just oblivious to the factors and histories making their decision a gauche one. It's understandable why that would be the first reaction, as it's easier to regard people as ignorant and in need of an education instead of intentionally reckless. It just reflects a less dire feeling about humanity.\n\nThis concept was addressed on the University of Maryland panel Panama and I were on a couple weeks ago. The infamous #PepsiLivesMatter commercial was brought up. And while the conversation started with us collectively regarding it as tone deaf, someone (I forgot who) asked if this happening was more due to ignorance or arrogance. And the more we talked about it, the more we started leaning arrogance. That the type of people behind Pepsi's misfire know that what they're doing is vulturizing the culture, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nThis conversation came to mind yesterday, while reading a Facebook thread discussing this restaurant. In it, in was revealed that the owner's girlfriend \u2014 a woman named Diana Strekalovskaya (who also might have some ownership stake) \u2014 reacted to the pushback by telling those upset to \"do something good for the community you live in\" instead of complaining. She also apparently shared a link to her own Facebook page Monday on the \"liberal fantasy of cultural appropriation.\" Of course, it can be unwise to attempt to approximate a person's cultural sensitivities and conscience solely based on two days worth of social media activity. Maybe, between sharing subtly racist statuses, she's in the lab attempting to cure sickle cell or something. But there's nothing here to suggest that the owners should be given any benefit of the doubt. Hawking hipster hip-hop fried chicken in the gentrified hood isn't a clueless misstep but an intentional and shameless cash grab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil, of course, they've made enough money off of the hood, and decide to go full Miley and bounce.

They had already done a great job, so it was really cool to just get our fingerprints on there a bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere you have it. Those scenes where Shuri delivers those delicious one-liners to T\u2019Challa (aka \u201cWhat are thoooooose\u201d)? The Glovers likely had a hand in creating them\u2014and only needed a few hours. I\u2019m also willing to bet they punched up some of M\u2019Baku\u2019s lines, too, but that\u2019s just my own pet theory.\n\nGlover also talked a little bit about his role as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story.\n\n\u201cAll the Star Wars are fun, but [with] this movie, we know what\u2019s gonna happen \u2026 we know they\u2019re not gonna die,\u201d Glover said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to have a lot more fun than in the other movies, where you have to deal with a lot of lineage and what\u2019s going to happen. I think this movie\u2019s just a fun, summer film. I\u2019m really excited about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, it\u2019d be a touch more exciting if the film were called, I don\u2019t know, Lando: A Thirst Trap Tale, but again, maybe that\u2019s just me. Either way, between his Grammy wins, Star Wars, his contributions to Black Panther and the upcoming premiere of season 2 of Atlanta, Glover is looking all types of golden.", "keywords": ["script", "assist", "fun", "talks", "wars", "donald", "star", "really", "glover", "whats", "black", "panther", "know", "film", "coogler"], "polarity": 0.22035480859010265, "subjectivity": 0.5557131185807657},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment. It\u2019s a good day to be black and sexy.", "keywords": ["im", "movies", "good", "movie", "soundtrack", "black", "album", "panther", "1994", "soundtracks", "think"], "polarity": 0.12011621556014075, "subjectivity": 0.40551459184636757},

If I work at a company and there aren\u2019t a lot of Black people around (likely) and white folks have questions (more likely), well, I\u2019m the guy to send them to. If HR and Legal wouldn\u2019t frown upon it, I\u2019d have placed an \u201cAsk This Black Guy\u201d sign on my door years ago.\n\nNot for nothing, I did check; HR and Legal did, in fact, frown upon that shit.\n\nI know lots of Black people who hate it when white people come to them and ask them questions about Blackness, pop culture, urbanism, hair styles, or any assorted cool thing that\u2019s happening in the world right now, with the assumption being that \u201cyou\u2019re Black, you might know this.\u201d I can understand how that might be annoying, especially when issa google and shit.

But the truth is, of course I know whatever it is. Is it because I\u2019m Black?, asks Syl Johnson. Not always. But mostly it\u2019s because typically I'm the coolest person in the professional room, being Black is just the icing on the cake. Since I probably do know the answer to the lecture at hand, I\u2019d rather they ask me than go off into the world with bad information, making some shit uncool on the wrong merits. They\u2019re already going to ruin it, I\u2019d prefer they knew what they were actually ruining. Context, unlike everything, is everything.\n\n[Sidenote: I\u2019m fully aware that all Black people don\u2019t know everything about Black culture.

I\u2019ll tell you exactly why it\u2019s racist and why you might be a racist for that line of thinking. In fact, I HAVE done just that at the day job. Numerous times. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had a co-worker come into my office, close the door - its how I always know that fuckery is afoot - and say, \u201cI have a question\u2026tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI usually start out with, \u201cif you have to ask, 9 times out of 10, you are wrong.

It is annoying that white people think that there\u2019s a single solitary Black answer to whatever ails them.

White people are never looking for a nuanced conversation about why Rosewood sets Black folks off\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2026white folks ain\u2019t seen Rosewood (lately). They\u2019re not looking to discuss the maturation of Nia Long and how it is proof positive that Black indeed, does not crack.\n\nWhite people want to know what the fuck is happening in the world today that cool people - the Black people - are doing and what game we\u2019re up on and want to make sure they\u2019re not racists. Almost every single conversation I\u2019ve ever had with my white coworkers where they felt a need to bring it to me centered around understanding something that they saw that they assume their teenage children might not understand even though we know their kids know all of it; guess whose coming to dinner, ma! OR some examination of racism in various form or fashion.\n\nIn a rare third category sits, \u201cI saw something that made me think about what you told me about the Black struggle and I want you to know that I understand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost every question white people ask has some sort of common sense, textbook answer.\n\n\u201cHow does your hair do that?\u201d (#boybye #girlbye #sorrynotsorry)\n\n\u201cAm I racist?\u201d (Yes.

Like many, I\u2019ve indulged in my share of posts showcasing my weight-loss journey and muscle gains. But though visuals can be inspiring, they can also haunt like the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n\n\nSeveral statistics and articles state that up to 95 percent of people who experience rapid weight loss from dieting will experience weight gain. Despite not jumping on the diet-pill wagon or seeking a quick fix, I fell into the statistics of people who gained some of their weight back within three years. For many, gaining the weight back represents failure, and can make one feel bitter and defeated. With this in mind, I wondered: Is it possible to associate the benefits of #TransformationTuesday with nonscale victories? Let\u2019s try.\n\nConsistently Incorporate Fitness Into Your Life\n\nLess than a week ago, I came across size-inclusive fitness-clothing company Superfit Hero\u2019s Instagram account and saw its hashtag #NewFitSpo, which encourages women to reclaim their bodies and redefine what fitness inspiration looks like for themselves. Hint: It doesn\u2019t take going to the gym six days a week to attain this goal. Instead, opt to start small by increasing your activity to three times a week for 20-30 minutes a day.\n\nTake on a New Activity\n\nThere\u2019s a pair of boxing gloves that has been collecting dust on the weight bench for two years. Maybe you\u2019ve been dying to try out a yoga class, but worried about committing to monthly fees. Consider jumping on sites like Groupon to become the next Laila Ali or headstand hero (or something like that). If your pockets are still recovering from the holiday season, look into free or pay-by-donation classes within your area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMix Healthier Dishes Into Your Diet\n\nFrankly, the word \u201cdiet\u201d scares the hell out of me, and I want no part of it. Instead, I love eating filling, flavorful dishes that prevent me from feeling stuffed. Throw some extra spinach into your omelet, or take on a #MeatlessMonday challenge that motivates you to include more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Studies show that cooking at home not only helps your diet but also may help in keeping more money in your pocket. You don\u2019t have to be a culinary guru or spend an excessive amount of time on intricate dishes. Meal prepping is helpful for everyone, from the single person juggling two jobs to a hectic family of six who crave 30 minutes of downtime.\n\nChange Up Your Makeup Routine\n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m the biggest tomboy on the planet, but I have a newfound love for blending together MAC\u2019s NC-45 and NC-50 foundations to achieve my desired shade. Years ago, I found myself fascinated with watching professional makeup artists work their magic on human canvases while assisting on my husband\u2019s photography set. My curiosity slowly transitioned from picking their brains about contouring to following YouTube tutorials for a natural look. In a matter of a few months, I became pretty decent at finding lip colors and bronzers that compliment my skin. You can, too: Apply that #TransformationTuesday hashtag by unleashing your inner Destiny Godley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShock Yourself and Wear a Bold Outfit\n\nGabrielle Union\u2019s clothing collection with New York & Co. has been reviving my womp-womp wardrobe from the dead. Her fashions have been making a chunky girl feel fat-girl-fresh for weeks! I sported one of her jumpsuits for a holiday party, and you couldn\u2019t tell me nothing; almost made me forget that I generally live in fitness gear. You can switch up your style, too: Pizzazz your life with something vibrant and different from your everyday wear. At the very least, put on some cute accessories and slay.\n\nWhat does all of this have to do with #TransformationTuesday? Every single thing. It\u2019s easy to admire all photos from strangers, wishing for the results they have. But instead of focusing on the number, let\u2019s work on the inside and allow that to shine outward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy changing your mindset, you can passively accomplish goals without the burden of the scale or a hashtag. Your mind, body and soul are all connected. And who knows?

[Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly. But the bottom line is that Viktor deserved better\u2014and frankly, so did we.", "keywords": ["lina", "viktors", "work", "iris", "constellations", "does", "belong", "artist", "appropriator", "lamar", "black", "video", "lamars", "york", "stars", "viktor", "kendrick"], "polarity": 0.012035738882329798, "subjectivity": 0.45026748819362444},

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

The visuals for this feminist banger are sure to garner comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation,\u201d as Mon\u00e1e is flanked by her own cadre of militantly clad women moving in tandem.

As she says, \u201cHit the mute button, let the vagina have a monologue.\u201d\n\nBut while \u201cDjango Jane\u201d is a banger, Mon\u00e1e still knows how to serve up a bop, and \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d definitely delivers.

The place is the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York City. The man is 18-year-old Colin Warner. It\u2019s a familiar scenario. An unarmed black man is walking through his own neighborhood, minding his business, when, within the blink of an eye, his whole life changes. Police officers pull up, tires screeching, and Warner is alarmed and confused because he\u2019s being arrested. And, immediately, we\u2019re faced with one of America\u2019s harshest truths: Black men (and men of color) are often deemed guilty until proved innocent. And, often, no one is trying to prove that black men are innocent.\n\n\n\nWarner is brought into the precinct and basically told that he\u2019s murdered a man. And Warner has no say in his own fate. There are no choices for him to make as the officers try to make him confess, which Warner never does because he didn\u2019t do it. But the guttural pleas of innocence from Warner\u2019s lips fall on deaf ears.\n\nThe film Crown Heights forces the viewer to face America\u2019s demons\u2014racism, a crooked justice system and the dehumanization of prisoners\u2014all in one emotional ride. The knot in my stomach ached for a teenage Colin (Lakeith Stanfield) having to face mental and physical anguish in prison, knowing he was an innocent man.\n\n\n\nFrom the arresting officers to the prosecutors to the prison guards and Warner\u2019s own legal counsel, the movie takes us down a long, frustrating road of something we\u2019re mostly all aware: a system that doesn\u2019t work for people who can\u2019t defend themselves. And it\u2019s usually people of color, namely black men, just like Colin Warner, who cannot defend themselves.\n\nCrown Heights shows you that clear evidence doesn\u2019t even implicate Warner. But the evils of law enforcement are determined to finger him and make him pay for the crime. And as a viewer, you\u2019re left wondering why, even though you\u2019re fully aware of the dangers and circumstances of racism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just thought they would be fair,\u201d Warner\u2019s mom says at one point in the film.\n\nWe all have the hope that the justice system will actually bring forth justice, even though we know better. We all held our breath, waiting to hear that George Zimmerman, Michael Dunn, or Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake were all found guilty of murder.\n\nAnd even though you know Warner\u2019s fate, you still hold your breath when the judge reluctantly reads the verdict.\n\nMost prisoners know deep down they put themselves here. I don\u2019t have that comfort. \u2014Colin Warner (Lakeith Stanfield)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut perhaps the biggest star of this entire film isn\u2019t a person at all\u2014it\u2019s Warner\u2019s support system in the form of his longest and dearest friend, Carl King (Nnamdi Asomugha).\n\nAs soon as he hears about the arrest, King is at the precinct to bail his friend out, only to be told that he has been denied bail. This will be the beginning of a 21-year battle King willingly takes on to help his friend see freedom again.\n\nHow long would it take for you to lose hope? I know that I am a good friend, but to have a dedication like King\u2019s and stick with Warner through 21 infuriating years of rejected justice is just a level of friendship I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d have been able to reach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, even Warner is over the constant disappointment and he chastises King for being there for him and begs him to stop. But King (Asomugha) counters with: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about you. It\u2019s bigger than that. It could be me in here. Sometimes I feel like it is me.\u201d\n\nAnd it is us, all of us. Mass incarceration and wrongful imprisonment affect us all. People go to jail more than 11 million times every year. Many of them are criminals, yes, but not everyone fits into the same mold.\n\nColin Warner\u2019s story is one of many, and that\u2019s what made me sad leaving the theater. While he\u2019s now free and able to champion for others falsely accused, the fact that people like him even exist makes you feel like this country is never going to value people of color in a way that humanizes us.\n\n", "keywords": ["wrongful", "exposes", "know", "conviction", "heights", "king", "friend", "colin", "problem", "crown", "warner", "warners", "system", "american", "men", "black", "common", "justice"], "polarity": 0.10144113549285966, "subjectivity": 0.5114494700701596},

In this campaign season, though, Donald J. Trump has been sucking up so much of the election coverage, the rest of those of that dumb-dumb-diddy demo have been overlooked.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am so grateful to Jon Girodes, the Republican candidate for New York\u2019s 30th Senatorial District, who's doing his part to make sure we all remember there are many other racist buffoons worthy of our ridicule and condemnation.\n\nAs NBC 4 New York reports, Girodes planned for an event in Harlem, which, I\u2019m sure in his mind, was some sort of attempt at black outreach. However, if you took a random poll of black folks, most would hear this plan and say something to the effect of, \u201cBitch, you got us f\u2014ked up.\u201d And he does.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan? Well, per an email Girodes sent out to NBC 4: \u201cI'm hosting an event in Harlem which will be in front of the state building in a few weeks. We will [donate] Kool Aid, KFC and watermelons to the public on 125th street in Harlem. Please join us to help the community.\u201d\n\nOf course, the image for this proposed event features Martin Luther King Jr., this type's personal get-out-of-\u201cThat\u2019s racist!\u201d card. Bless his ignorant, clueless heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who walks past that building just about every single day, I\u2019m trying to envision what it might look like to see some Republican stroll up to the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building and more or less offer a trio of stereotypes to black people.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is anyone who gives free food to people is doing them a favor,\u201d Girodes explained to NBC 4. \u201cGet a bunch of people who say it\u2019s offensive and let me go into their neighborhood and give it out for free and see if they take it.\u201d\n\nFine, I\u2019ll admit that if I just so randomly stumbled onto someone handing out chicken wings and fried fish sandwiches, it might initially pique my interest. No one will shame me for a love of either thing. That said, who goes to Harlem and offers KFC? There is a Popeyes on 116th, 125th and 145th streets. How are you shimmying into Harlem with KFC? No one wants that, you silly, likely no-seasoning-using man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re going to stereotype us, at least do so more productively.\n\nThen again, fried chicken is beloved by all, so to couple that with watermelon and Kool-Aid is pretty damn offensive. You want black votes, so you give black voters high cholesterol and \u201cthe sugar\u201d? For the love of God, it is National Diabetes Month.\n\nInterestingly enough, on several days throughout the week, there is a black woman who owns a solar-powered truck that serves delicious oyster po\u2019boys, shrimp and grits, and fried fish right outside that very building in front of which Girodes wants to troll black people. I\u2019ve talked to her before, and she\u2019s repeatedly explained to patrons that she\u2019s not using the truck as a means to one day get a restaurant. She\u2019s from Harlem and she\u2019s seen the rents go up over the years. For her, the truck is a way to do something she loves in a cost-effective and forward-leaning way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering that Republicans pretend to care so much about small-business people, a more sincere politician might have reached out to someone like her to try to sell his little shtick about lower taxes and other tenets of conservative ideology. Speaking of higher rent, Girodes is a real estate agent and, per the NBC 4 article about this whole ridiculous idea, possibly a shady one.

Because there's no fucking way he believes that even the dumbest of his supporters believe a word of his justification \u2014 which is that the medical care for transgender people is too expensive. And he knows we know it's bullshit. (Especially since the cost of transgender medical care is so minimal that the military spends 10 times as much on freakin Viagra.) And he knows we know that he knows.\n\nWe also know that Trump likely gives zero fucks about what transgender people do, and probably thought until maybe 53 minutes ago that \"transgender\" was just the name of Optimus Prime's wife. That said, Trump's actual feelings and apathies don't matter as much as what he actually does, and this was a clearly discriminatory act that does nothing but encourage more violence against a group of people who are already disproportionate victims of violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Trump does give fucks about, however, is this Russia-related heat on him and his family; a fire that burns hotter every day. His tweets were a way to deflect attention off of Russia while blowing a dog whistle and throwing a dog bone at his base. It was him reminding his people of his commitment to making America great again, and everything that means. And him feeling backed into a corner, and reaching deep into his bag(s) of Whiteness and Maleness and White Maleness to throw a counterpunch. And him reminding us that this is all he is, all he's ever been, all he'll ever be, and all he aspires to be.\n\nThis recklessness, this shamelessness, this level of transcendent petty, this annoyance and anger with facts, this apathy with how his actions will affect vulnerable people as long as it excites his base and oranges his skin, this treatment of women and minorities (disposable) and \"friends\" (expendable) and the truth (erasable) \u2014 this is capital letter WHITENESS at its whitest. It's Whiteness with unfettered access to unforeseen Whiteness rooms and hidden Whiteness portals. It's Whiteness completely unencumbered with constraint; Whiteness encouraged to seek and find an even whiter White. Donald Trump exists as a concretized distillation of all the things the creation of Whiteness was meant to be. He's a messy agglomeration of a thousand million trillion American Dreams; curated and congealed into a singular and sentient and terrifying reverie.\n\nHe's the Whiteness we've known since there was Whiteness to be known. Which is why, for those schooled in detecting pervasive Whiteness, nothing he's done or will do is a surprise. Still, seeing this destructive Whiteness unleashed is jarring; even for true believers, the violence of its language and the bruteness of its actions is unbelievable. The calamity it causes is unfathomable; its predilection for self-sabotage and self-destruction preposterous; its intentional obliviousness singular and total. And if we do not stop it, if we can't at least find a way to stem its damage and cauterize the wounds it inflicts, it will kill us all.", "keywords": ["wants", "allowed", "whiteness", "donald", "sprays", "hes", "drips", "trump", "white", "does", "way", "transgender", "know", "encouraged", "man"], "polarity": -0.10185185185185185, "subjectivity": 0.4810185185185185},
{"url": "https://theglowup.theroot.com/stop-putting-your-life-on-layaway-five-things-you-shou-1821669725", "title": "/stop-putting-your-life-on-layaway-five-things-you-shou-", "text": "Recently, Wifey and I went on a double date with another black lesbian couple I deeply admire. One of them is an \u00fcber-talented writer, artist and teacher, while the other is a nationally recognized food-justice consultant. After we\u2019d been out of touch for a while, the theme of the night was about catching up and supporting one another in next steps.\n\nTrouble is, I\u2019ve never been good at celebrating any of my accomplishments, so I sort of hemmed and hawed while trying to recount what\u2019s been going on with me. Later, in bed, I told Wifey that I felt uncomfortable talking about myself; it felt like bragging, and I just wanted to wait six months before I began celebrating some of these good moments in my life. As usual, she was ready\u2014we\u2019ve been together 18 years, and she knows me. She said to me, \u201cOne thing we have got to do is to stop putting our lives on layaway and start saying yes. Stop waiting for the future to celebrate ourselves, when we can celebrate now.\u201d\n\nThat got me thinking: What are the top five things we should say yes to in 2018?\n\n1. Friendship\n\nI\u2019ve always had a hard time making friends. Call me an adorable masculine-of-center dork, but making friends is hard, y\u2019all. I\u2019m socially awkward\u2014except online\u2014and I\u2019m also a homebody, so it complicates things when folks want to get to know me but also want to go kick it. Give me some Netflix, popcorn and a good glass of Baileys, and I\u2019m pretty much done for the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t need to say yes to everyone, but when you find people you vibe with, say yes. Get out of your comfort zone and go hang out. That said, you should make your boundaries known. For instance, I\u2019m not a club person. I only go to a club once or twice a year because I hate the scene. If your blossoming friendships favor a scene that\u2019s not ideal for you, set a boundary, then offer an alternative and find a compromise. I live in a place that has a big literary/art scene; on any given night, there\u2019s music (not in clubs), readings, spoken word, art openings. Find a spot where you can get to know your new friends offline.\n\n2. Love\n\nI\u2019ve been with Wifey for nearly 18 years, and as with any relationship, we have busy lives outside of each other, as well as up-and-down moments. In the past few years, we\u2019ve been challenged by a lot of change\u2014some pretty difficult moments, and some worth celebrating. Our love endures because we\u2019re best friends, but that\u2019s not the sexy part of who we are as a couple, and sometimes even the best relationships need a little shot in the arm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs 2017 wound down, Wifey and I agreed that we needed to step up our dating game. We\u2019ve always loved dating each other, but this new year will be a year of relationship renewal. We\u2019re both in a place where we want to challenge each other more; she is beautiful, intelligent and the kind of woman you don\u2019t want to disappoint, so I\u2019m excited to do it. Besides, we\u2019ve got the ride-or-die friendship on lock, so I look forward to trying new things\u2014both inside and outside the bedroom\u2014that kick up the spark in our romance department. It\u2019s a reboot that all relationships can benefit from. And though I haven\u2019t been single for a long time, I encourage single folks looking for excitement to say yes to exploring new love and relationships.\n\n3. Health\n\nIn November of 2015, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. It was a pretty difficult time for Wifey and me. The emergency room doctor told me that if I hadn\u2019t come in that weekend, I would\u2019ve had a stroke. It was a wake-up call, and for the first six months, I was really attentive to what I was eating, my exercise routine and lowering my stress. Then I lost my job and didn\u2019t keep up my routine. I\u2019ve been fat for a long time, and though I didn\u2019t look at adjusting my routine as an opportunity to lose weight, I do want to be around a little longer.\n\n\n\nThis year, I\u2019m recommitting to that routine. Again, this isn\u2019t a resolution to lose weight. We know that shit does not work. But it is a \u201cyes\u201d to just eating a little better, going bowling a little more (particularly during the winter) and, when the weather\u2019s nice, getting out in the sunshine. It also means saying yes to managing stress and anxiety, which means keeping up with therapy, finding healthy outlets like writing, and removing as many toxic people, things and unhealthy patterns from my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Artistic Endeavors\n\nI am a writer. It has taken me a long time to say that. I\u2019m working on my second novel and have a lot of other irons in the fire. And as much as writing creates some level of stress in my life, it\u2019s the good kind of stress: It gets my mind moving and makes me feel excited and creative. I\u2019m easier to live with when I write, I\u2019m less depressed and anxious when I write, and I\u2019m simply happier when I write.\n\nMaybe writing isn\u2019t your thing\u2014maybe it\u2019s painting, sculpture, graphic design or cosplay. Whatever your particular artistic endeavor is, say yes to it. Find like-minded people who share your artistic interests and begin to make those connections: Take a class, or just go to your local craft store and start crafting. And don\u2019t let folks tell you that your particular artistic endeavor \u201cisn\u2019t really art.\u201d If it makes you smile and gives you a little pep in your step, then do it!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating art is not about making money (though that can be a great outcome); it\u2019s about getting what\u2019s inside you out into the world so that you can reflect and imagine. Black folk, we have wonderful imaginations but are often told to suppress our creativity. Not this year! Say yes to imagination and creativity. In a society that seeks to rob us of our joy, we need to do this.\n\n5. Your Exit Strategy\n\nIn March 2016, I lost a job I\u2019d held for close to 13 years. Even though the environment was toxic and problematic, I was devastated. Like many of us, I grounded my identity in my job. Who was I without the job?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got a new job in August 2016, I worked hard to keep my identity separate from the gig. No matter how much I love my gig (and I do), the gig is not me and I am not the gig. I also know that\u2014as with most things\u2014jobs come to an end. Your end date may be this year, or in the next couple of years. But you should definitely say yes to crafting your exit strategy.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that you should always walk\u2014never run\u2014away from a job. Leave on a high note, with your integrity and legacy intact. Maybe you\u2019re starting a new job in 2018; from your first day, begin to think about what you want your legacy to be when you leave, and begin to plan your exit strategy.\n\nIn a writing fellowship I was in this past year, one of the mentors had us map out our writing careers for the next five to 10 years. It was a great challenge because she asked us to dream big and then map out how we were going to get where we wanted to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for other careers. Ask yourself: What\u2019s next for you? What kinds of skills can you gain from this gig that can take you to the next thing? Maybe you\u2019re already in your dream job; what\u2019s your next step in the position you\u2019re in? Do you want to move up? Are you looking to start your own consulting firm, or maybe move on to another company?\n\nI also know some of us can\u2019t leave our gigs. That\u2019s a fact of life. But I encourage you not only to find inspiration in your artistic endeavors (see No. 4) but also to think about what you can do to keep yourself sane in a job you may be stuck in. Are there new projects to tackle? Are there new things to learn in your field? What is your edge in the work that you\u2019re doing? Find your niche.\n\nSaying yes to your exit strategy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re leaving the job tomorrow. It means you\u2019re creating a plan for happiness and success, however you define it. Don\u2019t narrow your exit strategy; be bold in your creativity, map and plan\u2014ask a couple of friends to join in, and do vision boards or bullet journaling. Figure out your next steps, and you might find yourself well on your way to your next big thing!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of what I\u2019m telling you here is new. I mean, Shonda Rhimes told us about her Year of Yes in 2015. But maybe you were like me and didn\u2019t hear her. This year I\u2019m saying yes to these five areas of my life because I want to say yes to me. I encourage you to say yes to you, too!

But better still is Mon\u00e1e\u2019s thought process behind the videos and the album, which she shared with The Guardian in an article published Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the article, Mon\u00e1e discusses the death of her longtime mentor, Prince, whose influence can be felt both sonically and visually in \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to even speak about this because Prince was helping me with the album, before he passed on to another frequency,\u201d she says. His sudden death was \u201ca stab in the stomach. The last time I saw him was New Year\u2019s Day. I performed a private party in St Bart\u2019s with him, and after we sat and just talked for five hours. He was one of the people I would talk to about things, him and Stevie Wonder.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be as comfortable with who I am if it had not been for Prince. I mean, my label Wondaland would not exist without Paisley Park coming before us,\u201d Mon\u00e1e says. She laughs a little. \u201cHe would probably get me for cussin\u2019, but Prince is in that \u2018free motherfucker\u2019 category. That\u2019s the category when we can recognise in each other that you\u2019re also a free motherfucker. Whether we curse or not, we see other free motherfuckers. David Bowie! A free motherfucker. I feel their spirit, I feel their energy. They were able to evolve. You felt that freedom in them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom is in the foreground of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s newest project. It\u2019s about being bold and unapologetic in her identity as a black woman. She told The Guardian:\n\nDjango Jane is \u201ca response to me feeling the sting of the threats being made to my rights as a woman, as a black woman, as a sexually liberated woman, even just as a daughter with parents who have been oppressed for many decades. Black women and those who have been the \u2018other\u2019, and the marginalised in society \u2013 that\u2019s who I wanted to support, and that was more important than my discomfort about speaking out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the article notes, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d captures some of this sexual liberation. Tessa Thompson makes an appearance in the video as a potential love interest, along with a man. The two share heated glances, and a few scenes seem to refer back to Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode, a utopian fever dream that features a queer interracial couple.\n\nHere\u2019s how Mon\u00e1e described it:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a celebratory song,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that comes across. That people feel more free, no matter where they are in their lives, that they feel celebrated. Because I\u2019m about women\u2019s empowerment. I\u2019m about agency. I\u2019m about being in control of your narrative and your body. That was personal for me to even talk about: to let people know you don\u2019t own or control me and you will not use my image to defame or denounce other women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat final point\u2014about how people use her image to \u201cdefame or denounce\u201d other women\u2014is one that particularly bothers Mon\u00e1e.\n\n\u201cI see how people try to pit women against each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are people who have used my image to slut-shame other women: \u2018Janelle, we really appreciate that you don\u2019t show your body.\u2019 That\u2019s something I\u2019m not cool with. I have worn a tuxedo, but I have never covered up for respectability politics or to shame other women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe running theme in Mon\u00e1e\u2019s interview is of seizing control and being herself on her own terms\u2014something she\u2019s always done but is realizing in greater depth, detail and clarity with Dirty Computer.\n\n\u201cThis project was about painting in different colours, not just black and white; going in and allowing myself to use all the shades of the crayon box,\u201d Mon\u00e1e told The Guardian. \u201cIt was time to focus on being a complete, complex human being. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s gonna come with me and who\u2019s gonna criticize me, but I\u2019m not gonna renege, and I\u2019m not gonna hide.\u201d", "keywords": ["im", "prince", "thought", "women", "painting", "process", "mon\u00e1e", "gonna", "janelle", "inspiring", "dirty", "mon\u00e1es", "white", "feel", "black", "free", "woman", "outside"], "polarity": 0.09677098857426726, "subjectivity": 0.546727521112767},

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but Robbin\u2019 Season is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbin\u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nRobbin\u2019 Season looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

Taking pictures\n\nAt this point, I wouldn't terribly mind if people wanting to take pictures of me just photoshopped a default picture of me in front of wherever they wanted to take the picture of me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Removing shells from shrimp before I eat them\n\nJust takes too much effort, and wastes time that could be spent eating more delicious shrimp.\n\n8. What people under 30 (who I'm not related to or friends with) think or feel about anything\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorry, millennials.\n\n7. Being places that don't allow me to sit down if I want to sit down\n\nThis includes lines, the outdoors, packed church services, concerts, and certain types of sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. New rappers\n\nLast week, my 15-year-old nephew tried to put me on to something called a \"Montana 3000.\" And I tried to kick him out of the car and put him on to the curb. But, fortunately, the child safety locks were on.\n\n5. Learning how to swim\n\nI'll probably learn eventually, because the Wife Person cares. But my cabinet of \"learning how to swim\" fucks was emptied and donated to the Goodwill years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Being conscious of not doing stereotypically Black things in front of White people\n\nWhile in a restaurant during a job interview 12 or so years ago, I wanted the fried chicken \u2014 this place was known for their fried chicken \u2014 but ended up getting a bitch-ass chicken salad or something instead. Because I didn't want to do some stereotypical shit in front of the three (White) people conducting the interview.\n\nToday? I'd order and eat the shit out of that fried chicken. I'd stare them in the eyes while licking the chicken grease off my fingers. I'd get naked, rub watermelon lemonade on my body, and punch the fried chicken with my dick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Being the best player on the court when I play basketball\n\nI'm definitely not a straight role player now \u2014 I figure I (hopefully) have at least 10 more years of good basketball before I reach \"stand in the corner, spot up, and guard the other old guy\" status. But now I'm content to let the younger dudes and the older dudes who still do Crossfit and marathons and shit do the heavy lifting (most of the time) while I play more of a supporting role. Basically, I shifted from Chad Boseman to Anthony Mackie.\n\n2. Writing unflattering things about myself\n\nLike many of the fuck depletions listed, losing these particular fucks is incentive-based because its specifically beneficial for me. The more willing I am to share unflattering shit, the better my writing gets. And the better my writing gets, the more lapdances I can buy for Panama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Whether people like me\n\nNow, to be clear, I'd definitely rather have people like me than not. Having people like you is fun and shit. And I imagine its no fun being Tyga. But, I don't know.

I do.\n\nAt some point, we all got the don\u2019t-say-nigga anymore memo. I shredded mine and threw it away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t say that I say the n-word unapologetically. I think it\u2019s wrong. Now, I\u2019m not one of those people who believe that if we don\u2019t want white people to say it, we have to stop saying it as well. We all need to stop saying it because the word is just done. It goes in the category of spanking your kid or not wearing a seatbelt. Sure, it made sense at the time. When you know better you do better.\n\nBut when it comes to the forbidden word, I\u2019m not doing better. I\u2019m Richard Pryor before he took his life-changing trip to Africa. I swirl it around in my mouth like a fine wine at a tasting. I use it the way I use the word fuck\u2014sparingly but with aggression. It punctuates my conversations with certain people. It comes out under my breath\u2014dis nigga\u2014when I\u2019m watching certain shows. It signals to myself and others that I\u2019m code-switching\u2014I\u2019m letting my hair down and being the n-word-using version of myself.\n\n(I\u2019ve often wondered if President Obama ever used the n-word in the White House. Did he every whisper dis nigga under his breath when some craziness went down? I\u2019m going to say no. He\u2019s from Hawaii and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t hear people use it in a code-switching way. Now Michelle? I need y\u2019all to understand, she tossed off an n-word in her mind at least once in eight years.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy brand as a writer is carefully curated. Read my posts and you\u2019ll find that I\u2019m polite, friendly and helpful. I don\u2019t curse in my work\u2014unless its fiction. The me you see on social media is genuine, for sure. But it\u2019s not the me who throws out a nigga please when necessary like I\u2019m an ODB album.\n\nBut I think I\u2019m done now.\n\nI had a day party this weekend. (More on that later. Hmph.) I invited a bunch of my Day Ones that I don\u2019t get to see often even though we all live super close. One of my Day Ones, let\u2019s call him Daryl, came with his wife Kelly. When I say Daryl is my Day One? Let me explain. I met him when I was four years old. He introduced himself by damn near running me over with his Big Wheel tricycle. We lived on the same street and went to elementary school together and college as well. I doubt very seriously that I have any friends that are not also Daryl\u2019s friend as well. He\u2019s super smart, loyal and his hip-hop playlists are just sick. I love this guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo. We\u2019re chopping it up\u2014hip-hop, politics, kids, etc.\u2014and at one point he said something that made me roll my eyes. I sucked my teeth and said: Nigga is you crazy?\n\nDaryl looked at me: \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\nBefore I could even explain that I was saying it playfully, Daryl shook his head. \u201cNah, not over here. That word? No.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was stunned. In my head I\u2019m like, wait Daryl! It\u2019s me, Aliya! From East Orange. You my nigga!\n\nDaryl must have read my mind cause he continued: \u201cI\u2019m not the \u2013gga version or the \u2013er version.\u201d\n\nI felt horrible.\n\nI know I have friends who don\u2019t use the word. But I didn\u2019t know I had friends who didn\u2019t want me to use the word around them. Was I going to have to start code-switching within my friends and family?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI started to think about who I said the word around. My mom? Occasionally. My siblings? Yup. My dude? At least 12 times a day.\n\nBut I realized that none of them used the word with me. I\u2019m sure they have here and there. But I couldn\u2019t think of a single instance.\n\nSociety as a whole had given me the first never-say-nigga memo, the one I shredded and tossed with a maniacal laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Daryl, someone who has supported me since I was five years old, was now handing me the memo. And I took it with hot shameful tears in the corners of my eyes. Yes, I know, I sound super dramatic. But it really did hit me. There are some people who could have said that to me and I would have just rolled my eyes and thought dis nigga under my breath.\n\nDaryl is not one of those people.\n\nHe has an incredible wife I\u2019ve known for over two decades. (I would never call her a nigga). He has two brilliant children, just like I do. (None of whom I would ever call a nigga.) We both lost our dads literally days apart earlier this year. (Two men I would never call a nigga.) Our mothers have had a warm friendship for forty years. (Two women I would never call a nigga.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if anyone said nigga is you crazy to any of those people\u2014joking or not\u2014it would be a serious problem. It took Daryl\u2019s reaction for me to see the insanity of my use of the word.\n\nA few years back, a group of my online friends had an email chain going. Someone came up with the idea of saying president instead of nigga and first lady instead of bitch. It worked pretty well. And sometimes it was humorous the way president worked as a substitute for the n-word.\n\nSo that\u2019s where I am as of today. No more n-word. When I\u2019m watching the news and I\u2019m freaking out about my healthcare as a freelancer, I\u2019m going to use dis president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering who I\u2019m usually talking about when I whisper that word-clearly it works just fine.", "keywords": ["im", "sure", "igga", "nigga", "friends", "confessions", "saying", "daryl", "nword", "word", "think", "begins", "say", "true", "ends", "n"], "polarity": 0.11027180284992784, "subjectivity": 0.5334449404761905},

I mean, we were Christians, technically, but Christianity, in our house, felt like more of a benevolent and perfunctory directions guide than any sort of edict. I was taught to pray before every meal\u2014a ritual I still follow today. The Lord\u2019s name was never to be said in vain. And there were Bibles around, somewhere. But we never actually went to church ourselves. The only time I went was for funerals and if I happened to be spending the night at one of my grandparents\u2019 houses. (Also, I went to Catholic school from sixth to eighth grade, and I\u2019d attend Mass when it was Mass-attending time.)\n\nWe did, however, worship at the church of Kool-Aid. And the only reason I\u2019m comparing Kool-Aid consumption to religious beliefs is to give you an accurate measure of how fanatic about Kool-Aid we were. If you were to randomly peek into our refrigerator at any point, you\u2019d likely find orange juice and you\u2019d probably find milk, but you\u2019d definitely, absolutely find a half-gallon container of Kool-Aid. If it wasn\u2019t in there, it was because it was currently being made. And if it wasn\u2019t currently being made, there was definitely a conversation happening about who drank the last of the Kool-Aid because that person is slacking on their Kool-Aid restocking duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were so fanatical that I can tell you which flavors go best with certain types of meats. For steaks and burgers, grape is the best choice. If you\u2019re eating seafood, orange. And if you\u2019re eating poultry, you\u2019ll need a glass of red Kool-Aid to best wash that bitch down.\n\nMy Kool-Aid fever stretched into adulthood. Because I loved and was addicted to the way it tastes. But also because it\u2019s cheap as fuck. You can buy 29,000 packets for, like, a nickel. And not only did I buy the normal grapes and oranges and reds\u2014I also bought the slightly off-brand flavors like red cherry and raspberry and the shit they clearly only sold as an experiment to see if niggas would buy it, like bacon-blueberry and pistachio. In my first apartment\u2014a 600-square-foot space on the corner of Ellsworth and Negley in Shadyside\u2014the only things you\u2019d always find in my fridge were bacon, eggs, creamy Caesar salad dressing, orange juice and Kool-Aid.\n\nAnd then one day that all changed.\n\nIn my apartment were two women I\u2019d recently met. I offered them something to drink. One of them asked what I had in my fridge. I told her Kool-Aid. She replied:\n\n\u201cNigga, you still drinking Kool-Aid?\u201d\n\nNow, as veteran \u201cnigga\u201d users know, \u201cnigga\u201d is not a word that you typically use haphazardly with black people you just met. It\u2019s a term of familiarity\u2014not something you say when answering an innocent question from a nigga you just met three days before. But that \u201cnigga\u201d was used to articulate how disappointed she was that I was drinking Kool-Aid, and how annoyed she was that I had the audacity to offer it to her. Basically, I was Kool-Aid-shamed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it worked. By the end of that year, it was no longer a part of my daily consumption. I stopped buying it, and would only drink it when I visited my parents. And now I live a Kool-Aid-free life, replacing it with room temperature bottled water and lukewarm whiskey.\n\nBut although I\u2019ve come to realize how bad it is for you\u2014it\u2019s just sugar and water and literally nothing else\u2014I miss it from time to time. Particularly when I\u2019m eating chicken. I\u2019ve also realized, over the last few years, that Kool-Aid is quite a polarizing topic. It doesn\u2019t quite reach the level of the grit wars or the jollof-rice wars, but it\u2019s close. Just admitting that you do (or don\u2019t) drink Kool-Aid\u2014and when or why you started or stopped\u2014is the black equivalent of the Myers-Briggs. Everything that needs to be known about you can be told through your feelings about it and your experience with it.\n\nAnyway, I want to hear about your Kool-Aid experiences. But please don\u2019t share any pictures of you drinking it, because that might be triggering for me.", "keywords": ["eating", "nigga", "koolaid", "feel", "drinking", "met", "drink", "buy", "youd", "orange", "went"], "polarity": 0.006956250819887192, "subjectivity": 0.50238455988456},

Now that we\u2019ve seen a trailer for Solo and are hearing Glover talk about playing Cloud City\u2019s chief dude, our hunger for a Lando-centric project has only intensified.\n\n\n\nGlover was interviewed by Entertainment Weekly about donning the iconic cape of Star Wars\u2019 favorite hustler and says that, obviously, wardrobe was a huge part of getting in character:\n\nLando\u2019s not really the best dressed person on that set. And I don\u2019t say that lightly. There\u2019s just a lot of cool costumes and a lot of cool clothing. Lando\u2019s clothing, that\u2019s what I like. I was secretly super happy. His clothing is another spice of life. He takes pride in the clothing. It makes things easier. When people see you and you\u2019re debonair, they tend to want to give you stuff easier. [Laughs] Yeah, people are like, oh, this guy\u2019s got it together. He\u2019s obviously not starving, you know. He has enough leisure time to choose a nice outfit.\n\nGlover also talks about opportunities to be found in playing Lando as a younger man:\n\nI always like seeing younger characters when they are in younger times because it tells a lot about how they got to where they are. Like, when I was a teenager I felt like I knew a lot, but I didn\u2019t. By the time we meet him in Empire Strikes Back, he owns the city already. [Laughs] So, I wanted to show the person he was before that was even possible. Like, I don\u2019t even know if he thought that was possible at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s more fun details in the interview so head on over to EW to read the whole thing.

But, mostly, as a light-skinned, nonbiracial, hopefully self-aware black woman, I felt painfully aware that conversations about colorism are still uncomfortable for me\u2014and, often, should be.\n\nThose aren\u2019t \u201clight-skinned tears\u201d\u2014or light-skinned guilt\u2014just a simple admission that I\u2019m occasionally challenged by how to honestly and effectively address privilege and oppression in the same space and breath. Because while I can readily acknowledge the many ways my privilege overrides my oppression\u2014including the \u201cpretty privilege\u201d that afforded me a modeling career (albeit as a plus model, which is another story)\u2014it\u2019s a balancing act to do so without throwing my own experiences under the bus. (Because contrary to the popular belief espoused above, light-skinned women aren\u2019t actually \u201cbroken down that easy.\u201d)\n\nBut it\u2019s necessary work and therefore, a discussion I continue to have with myself. I\u2019d hope (wish?) that white women would have similar discussions with themselves as they approach the intersection of racism and feminism, and that black men would do the same as they consider the benefits and functions of patriarchy, as well as cis-hetero white men in relation to ... well, everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so on, and so on. ... For instance, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re enjoying a first-world, net-neutral (for now) privilege, in and of itself. But the best way to deconstruct someone else\u2019s privilege and resulting pathology is to first make sense of your own. You know\u2014oxygen masks, and all that.\n\nAnd what better place to have that conversation than here at The Glow Up?\n\nVeronica Webb and I crafted this space with a mission: to represent, inspire and empower all iterations of black womanhood. How can we do that by ignoring the rainbow in the room? And no, that doesn\u2019t just mean simply addressing the issues and needs of our LGBTQ sisters, but the full spectrum of shades in which black women arrive, whenever and wherever they enter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not ignorant or dismissive of the optics: No matter how well-meaning or qualified, can two black women privileged in seemingly similar ways ensure that The Glow Up will be\u2014for lack of a less-clich\u00e9d word\u2014inclusive?\n\nThree weeks in, we\u2019re a work in progress, and I hope we always will be. Even during our brief tenure, we\u2019ve already faced concerns of elitism and being too \u201ckumbaya\u201d about colorism. So this video inspired me to initiate a conversation we all need to be more comfortable having. And before we continue, maybe it\u2019s best to start by saying what many of us wish had been said, in so many instances:\n\nI believe you.\n\nWhatever your experience with colorism is, it\u2019s not for me to explain away, or turn into something more comfortable for me to digest. I will not use denial to \u201cwhat about\u201d anyone into submission. My job\u2014especially here\u2014is to listen, observe, empathize when possible, act when necessary and to trust what I\u2019m hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe you. I hope you\u2019ll believe me, too.\n\n\n\nBecause while I\u2019m not \u201ckumbaya\u201d enough to think that belief alone is enough to heal the damage of colorism, I am humble enough to admit that I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019ve been fetishized because of my color more than I\u2019ve been rejected. I know I\u2019ve been rejected, in turn. I also know that I can\u2019t speak for anyone\u2019s experience but my own; but above all else, I know that this shit does a deep disservice to us all\u2014especially us women.\n\nWhen I shared this film with a few colleagues, one of them questioned its effectiveness, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this video is trying to do. It\u2019s just a bunch of insults while images of normal, attractive women stand around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, I agree. So, when I ask how a film like the one above makes you feel, it\u2019s because we need to know, and we need to talk about it. We need to be honest about where this ongoing issue sits in our bodies, and under our skins, individually and collectively. And then we need to believe one another. As a colored girl, I need to be able to speak, write and think openly about colorism\u2014and I still have much to learn.

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

B. Weiss that rewrites history to depict an America where the Confederate states successfully seceded \u2014 might actually end up being a good show. I don't have much faith that it actually will be. This series is a re-imagining of America's relationship with race, racism, slavery, class, and how each affects the micro, day-to-day minutiae of our existences, our national, cultural, and racial zeitgeists, and our existential understandings of what it means to be \"White\" and \"Black\" and \"American.\" These are canyonesque concepts for anyone to wrestle with \u2014 even those who've specifically devoted their social, political, professional, and academic lives to studying, examining, deconstructing, and making art about race. And there's nothing in either Benioff's or Weiss's backgrounds or careers that suggests they're equipped to do so. But, to (mis)quote Calvin Candie, a character from another big-budget re-imagining of slavery, they have my curiosity and my attention. And they might surprise me.\n\nWhat hasn't surprised me is that an idea this ambitious from two people who don't seem to have any real experience with the nuanced and explosive subject matter is getting greenlighted. Because these two people are White men. And White men get their ambitious, insane, reckless, and inane ideas funded all of the fucking time. They get money for TV shows and movies no one will watch. Investments in start-ups no one asked for. Funding for apps no one will use. Loans for restaurants no one will eat at. Grants for condominium complexes no one will live in. Capital for websites no one will visit. Deals for books no one will read.\n\nBari Williams examined this phenomenon a couple months ago.\n\n\n\nWomen start companies at twice the rate of men, yet women comprise only 16% of tech founders. According to a study by First Round Capital, founding teams including a woman outperform their all-male peers by 63%, but female CEOs get only 2.7% of all venture funding, while women of color get virtually none: 0.2%. The fact that black women are educated and entrepreneurial yet so underfunded is a confluence of broadening thoughts of diversity, use of technology, and economic policy. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased limits for tax write-offs for startups, such as the ability to deduct cell phone bills and depreciation, and health care costs. This was great news for black women, who tend to be younger when they found their companies, have more debt, and less access to capital. Black women have greater difficulty receiving funding from investors and creditors, and difficulty securing lending due to racial bias. But tax write-offs don\u2019t make up for the funding gap. When black women are funded, they get the short end of the stick, with the average raise round totaling just $36,000. Compare that figure to the composite of the average white male startup founder, who banks an average of $1.3 million in funding. The secondary problem with not receiving mainstream large VC funding? Scaling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the focus here is Black women in tech, this standard transcends fields. It exists in media and entertainment. In real estate and academia. In for-profit businesses and non-profit organizations. Forget about getting into the door. We \u2014 and \"we\" in this context is \"anyone who isn't a White male\" \u2014 need to produce all types of evidence and receipts and successes in order to just get an email reply. While White men are allowed to fail. Repeatedly. And given more leeway to dream up new and random-ass shit because they know if they keep getting shots at the dartboard, they'll eventually hit the target. Which results in a self-fulfilling circle jerk where White dudes get the money because investors trust them more than anyone else because White dudes' successes are more spectacular because White dudes get more chances to be spectacular because White dudes get the money because investors trust them more than anyone else.\n\nStill, maybe Confederate will surprise us. Who knows? But I do know that if it crashes and burns, Benioff and Weiss will get another chance. And another chance after that chance. And another chance after that chance.

Out into the sunlight with that feel for freedom that you haven\u2019t felt since your very first bill arrived in the mail. It was jubilant. We still had cupcakes on our breath from the nice teacher who brought them for the last day of school and, as we fanned out onto the front lawn of the building, we all stopped cold in our tracks and a silence swept through the crowd. We all stood staring with our mouths open at what towered before us. It was unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen and I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\n\nIn front of all the stark yellow busses meant to ferry us home, was standing a man. A big white man with a big white belly and a big white beard and behind him was a behemoth glinting in the sunlight. It was white and tan and brand new and it sucked up all the air around it. It was something my classmate called an RV. Big enough to fit all of Kool and the Gang. From the front to the back of it looked like a mile and this big, white man was standing in front of it with his arms folded proud as punch. He was the father of one of my classmates, and had come to take her directly from school into their summer vacation. We all stared at it and approached it carefully. She, his daughter, was already on the boast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the Grand Canyon and then we\u2019re going to Yellowstone and then we\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d\n\nI had stopped listening. The sheer grandeur of this vehicle had left me green with envy. My family didn\u2019t have no Grand Canyon money and I really didn\u2019t know that people outside of TV did this sort of thing. Her father was nice. He let some of us wander through it and my envy grew greater. There were beds! Friggin beds and a bathroom with a sink and toilet that worked and a little makeshift kitchen-like thing and room to walk around. I swore on that day that I would experience this RV life. I swore it to the portrait of white Jesus that hung in our church the very next Sunday. I would have an RV and I would travel the world in it by myself.\n\nSince then, I have often dreamed of the Great American Road Trip. I\u2019ve fantasized about the open road and leaving my cares behind while listening to John Denver. Just me and a dog named Too Short or Bushwick Bill. I still close my eyes and think about driving through America\u2019s Heartland. But, as I\u2019ve gotten older, there\u2019s only one thing keeping me from my dream and that\u2019s America\u2019s Heartland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book was a guide for black people who wanted to travel the United States. It was published from 1936 to 1966 and it did just what it advertised. It guided black Americans as to what places we could stay, what roads not to take and what time black people had to officially be indoors in this great land of ours. And, even though the book went out of print in 1966, you can\u2019t convince me with love nor money that we don\u2019t still need it. I watch the news. I\u2019ve seen what goes on in the Dust Bowl states and, what good is the open road if it\u2019s not open to you? I do not want my trail to go missing somewhere in Adair County Oklahoma.\n\nSome might say that I\u2019m being histrionic. But, they always say that until something happens and then there\u2019s the wave of \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened in America!\u201d shock until it all dies down and something else happens. I do not want to travel alone through Trumpland as a black man and that\u2019s a shame because it adds to long list of things that black Americans are dissuaded from doing in the U.S.. Like laughing or walking the streets. I still fantasize about doing it, though. I still want to feel the wind whip through my afro while Bushwick Bill sticks his head out the back window and let his ears catch the same wind. But, I\u2019m gonna have to gain weight first. Take a deep breath. Learn how to use GPS and how to keep my head up at all times. I\u2019m still working on that.\n\nOne time, when I was a kid, my sister bet me that I couldn\u2019t go on the Scary House ride at Geauga Lake all by myself. Because sisters are always wrong, I took her up on it and climbed into that little green car by myself. My friends were all watching and it was all tickertape and balloons and streamers and shouts of encouragement and I gave them all a big thumbs up before that little vehicle took off with me inside and then it got really real. This was back when funhouses were meant to cause you emotional trauma and I\u2019m gonna tell you the damn truth. When the ghosts and goblins and witches started jumping out at me from the pitch blackness, I was a mess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI shit myself a little bit that day and had to spend the rest of our time at the park tryna hide it. It was uncomfortable.\n\nI swear on Black Jesus\u2019 name that I will not be found in Adair County, Oklahoma dead with shitty drawls and a pile of drugs on me that I didn\u2019t have when I got there. I won\u2019t do it.\n\nBut one day I will. When the time is right.

I love Jesus, too; still, the holiday season overlaps with cuffing season, and with all that cold weather and love in the air, you are likely to spend your time either drinking eggnog while laid up with the one you love or sipping something dark and flavorful contemplating why you\u2019re alone on Christmas Eve. Musical artists know this\u2014that is why there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to brown-liquor Christmas songs.\n\nAs I stated before, in order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria:\n\nIt must have a pronounced bass line.\n\nThis bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony.\n\nThe sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for it to qualify as a brown-liquor Christmas song, it must do Nos. 1 to 3 while also commenting upon or utilizing symbols of the holiday season. This can be done by a) turning a traditional Christmas song into a brown-liquor song (see: the Temptations\u2019 \u201cSilent Night\u201d); b) taking a symbol of Christmas and using it in playful and libidinous ways (see: Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d); or c) using Christmas as a setting to lament the one who got away (see: Luther\u2019s \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas\u201d).\n\nMany Christmas songs qualify, but below, I present to you the 10 best brown-liquor Christmas songs of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\u201d by Kenny Burrell\n\nThis is a soulful and jazzy cover of the Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers classic. It\u2019s perfect background music for when you have friends over and you\u2019re mixing up amaretto sours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d by John Coltrane\n\nI\u2019m a jazz snob. I don\u2019t do the cheap, elevator-music-adjacent Kenny G bastardization of the black-American art form. If it doesn\u2019t push the boundaries of melody, then you can miss me with your whitewashed, sweet-white-wine shenanigans. \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d by \u2019Trane is a 13-minute encounter with the divine. It is a masterpiece and perfect with a hot buttered bourbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSanta Claus Wants Some Loving,\u201d by Albert King\n\nEven Santa has needs. This raunchy jawn is your crazy uncle\u2019s second-favorite Christmas song. He drinks Jim Beam out the bottle while he listens to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d by Luther Vandross\n\nLuther\u2019s voice was one of a kind. \u201cIntimate,\u201d \u201csultry\u201d and \u201cvelvety\u201d don\u2019t do it justice, and his voice is on full display as he sings about how the holiday is a source of pain because his lover is not with him. Sip this with Crown Royal and ginger ale. Be sure you don\u2019t get tears in the glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cA Child Is Born,\u201d by Oscar Peterson\n\nThis is a quiet, mournful jazz standard written by composer Alec Wilder and trumpeter Thad Jones. On this cover, Peterson improvises on the melody, filling out the sonic landscape of the song in ways that make it both soulful and melancholic. Watch the snowfall as you listen to this and drink a Swedish glogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas,\u201d by Charles Brown\n\nThis is the official Christmas song of juke joints and liquor houses everywhere. Charles Brown\u2019s vocalizations put one in the mood to sip something brown and aged while yearning for the one who got away. Pair this with a Macallan 18-year, straight, no chaser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d by the Temptations\n\nThe Temptations\u2019 rendition of this Christmas classic is a soulful blend of the sacred and the secular. Listening to Glenn Leonard makes me do the ugly church face ubiquitous in black houses of worship. This is your spiked-apple-cider song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cLet It Snow,\u201d by Boyz II Men\n\nChristmas is in winter, and winter is cuffing season. I contend that \u201cLet It Snow\u201d is the definitive sexy Christmas song. \u201cThe market is full of widely recognized artists singing the usual classics,\u201d says Elon Dancy, professor of education and associate dean for community engagement and academic inclusion at the University of Oklahoma. He is a scholar world-renowned for his research into black men in higher education but is also an underappreciated cultural critic. He continues, \u201cHowever, one of the special contributions of Christmas Interpretations is that the majority of the album is original Christmas music \u2026 it is musical velvet.\u201d Keep warm as this plays by sipping a spiked hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cBack Door Santa,\u201d by Clarence Carter\n\nOn this track, Carter is petty, trifling and brilliant. That\u2019s why this is your crazy uncle\u2019s favorite Christmas song. He gets fancy, says, \u201cWhat you young bucks know \u2019bout dis right cha,\u201d and drinks Courvoisier out of a snifter as he grooves to this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cThis Christmas,\u201d by Donny Hathaway\n\nMuch has been said about this track, so I will just stress to you how strongly I feel that this is the official Christmas song of black folks everywhere. This joint is suitable for every occasion and pairs with any drink. Yet I choose to enjoy it with Johnnie Walker Blue\u2014because I\u2019m bougie.", "keywords": ["soulful", "best", "santa", "christmas", "season", "song", "track", "ranked", "sipping", "songs", "brownliquor", "know"], "polarity": 0.19685639880952382, "subjectivity": 0.5408978174603175},

But only a brief year before, a judge had ruled against pop star Kesha in her own exhaustive sexual abuse trial in favor of Sony Music and her alleged abuser, producer Dr. Luke.\n\nIn this watershed moment, what would the music industry have to offer when its own moment of reckoning has so far seemed muted, at best? This was the concern shared by Voices in Entertainment, a grassroots group initiated by female music execs concerned that the movement wasn\u2019t effectively reaching the music industry. Their first initiative? An email encouraging Grammy Awards attendees to wear white roses, in what would hopefully become the music industry\u2019s version of the #TimesUp blackout on the Golden Globes red carpet.\n\nBut while there were many white roses and #TimesUp pins among the designer finery on the Grammys red carpet, the most powerful moment of the night would be onstage. During her introduction of what would be an emotional performance by Kesha, musician and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e gave a compelling speech, reminding the audience assembled at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden and abroad:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry. Artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. We come in peace, but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us, we offer you two words: Time\u2019s up. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power. Because you see, it\u2019s not just going on in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just going on in Washington; it\u2019s right here in our industry as well. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo a culture that does not serve us well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a Grammys moment well worth remembering, and \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business\u201d are words we won\u2019t be surprised to hear become a common phrase within the #TimesUp moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019re already ready to say it with our chests, in our fast-fashion culture, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll only be a matter of hours before we can do so.

(He does have a pretty impressive beard.) Three brave people volunteered as tributes, to attend and report back on their findings. Here are their stories.\n\nVSB: Who are you, and what compelled you to attend Hotepalooza?\n\n\n\nChristine: Hi y'all! I'm Christine Curtis from Brooklyn. I went to that \"meeting\" because I heard a lot about Umar Johnson and some of his beliefs and I wanted to know who are the people that support him? Does he really have this large following? What will he do and say when speaking to a receptive audience? And to be honest, he shocked and did not disappoint me. I thought it would be funny, fun, sad and a true test of my anger management classes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoel: I'm Joel Philip. I'd like to say I was under the influence of cotton candy & quaaludes when I attended Umar Johnson's Dashiki Dynasty Vol. 1 Mixtape Premier Party, but I totally chose this as a personal challenge to myself. I went in with an open mind that perhaps there's a method to his madness, as I am not a fan of organized religion or snake oil salesman. I lucked out with a two for one deal. My assumption was the message would have some kind of gravity to it, and if I could put my ego to the side for a moment, perhaps it would resonate. It did. The way Taco Bell & White Castle resonate at 3 AM after a night of Jager Bombs and cheap coconut vodka. Pray for that toilet.\n\nMalaika: My name is Malaika Aaron-Bishop, and I might be a bougie black person but I'm not sure cause I really, REALLY hate room temperature water. Still, the authenticity of my blackness gets called into question more times than I wanna admit. I'm an immigrant (born in Guyana, moved to the States in my early teens) so I often find myself clueless on the subject of even the most basic American pop cultural references. Still, even now I sometimes get caught slippin'. Ready? Confession time: a white person told me about Dr. Umar. *gasp* But I'm black and living in the US so I got schooled real quick on American-grade racism, race relations, racial politics, etc. No questions over here about who I am, and where I stand in the struggle.\n\nThat said, for me, Dr. Umar's event was two parts social study and one part entertainment with a splash of masochism. I had all the questions Christine had. Is this dude for real? Does he actually believe the shit that comes out his mouth? Was that 45min YouTube stint last year a marketing scheme to generate an audience for something more substantial? And speaking of audiences, in this day and age where your cellphone can literally tell you everything you wanna know about anything, what kind of fancy, Santeria-esque shit does one have do to spin consciousness or as the doc would say \"konsciousness'? But lo and behold the #MostRequestedScholar did the fucking thing. People came, paid their money, and clapped for ALL the shit. I won't lie, if I weren't so appalled I'd be impressed. I not-so-secretly, secretly like when black people do fuckshit and get their money, so I walked in, not so much with Joel's open mind but kinda sorta ready to root for the nigga if he said just a few things that made some sense. He didn't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine: I was surprised at how normal everybody looked.\n\nMalaika: Right?!? Every time Umar would say some particularly outlandish shit, I'd look around to see how folks would react! And everyone looked perfectly normal and composed. It was baffling.\n\nJoel: I think what made it more ironic is the same kind of women he was speaking about stereotypically with hair and nails were in the audience, clapping like he was talking about everyone but them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike shorty\u2026.your weave was done 30 minutes ago and you spent cash money on your nails, HE IS CLEARLY TALKING ABOUT YOU WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE GHETTO BLACK NAME HE MADE UP TO TALK ABOUT BLACK WOMEN\n\nVSB: Did he say anything that made you think \"Hmm. This charlatan nigga might have a point.\"?\n\nJoel: 1) He spoke on the public school to prison pipeline for young black boys. Though how he went about it is ridiculous, a main point was true: the teachers are not your friend and your children are there to learn, not to be entertained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) Single parents have irrational fears when they go to school about their child's conduct. Especially if they are being their child is not on par for their age appropriate grade and must go to a remedial course instead. He stated parents allow themselves to be backed into a corner and end up st the mercy of the school instead of fighting for proper proof.\n\n3) The labeling of children as ADHD is outrageously rampant and doesn't make sense.\n\n4) Black people question other black people who have business ventures, ideas, or crafts while supporting white establishments without posing the same questions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalaika: I think you might be giving him too much credit with those take aways. He spoke in enough cliches and gave enough half true illustrations that you being an intelligent, well read individual could draw reasonable conclusions from. If you took him at his actual word, white folks are \"engineering\" black boys to be gay so that they could \"ensure\" they get AIDS in ORDER to \"infect our sistahs.\"\n\nChristine: No he didn't and fuck that guy!!\n\nHe is a dumpster fire of nonsense and misogynoir.\n\nHe doesn't have any developed ideas. He is like the ADHD kids he claims to believe don't exist. He is the black Donald Trump when it comes to rambling and contradictory statements in the same speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that the schools try to intimidate parents by having a bunch of white people in the room to speak with the mother. Then he gave examples of people in the room like the school nurse and the counselor and the child's teacher. Like they have no business being in a meeting about a child. Now Umar has a solution for you! Get a recently paroled nigga to sit in on the meeting. He said find a guy with visible jailhouse tats that looks like he will go off if the people say the wrong thing and take him to the meeting. Because you need a man in the room with you when you have to take care of things with you child.\n\nHe said that he is a psychotherapist and he has testified in court for plenty of cases. But in hour two and a half he said he doesn't have a license or a degree from any college because he didn't want to work for white people!!\n\nI was so fucking DONE!!!\n\nThis no class thin polyester dashiki wearing piece of used toilet paper had the nerve to say that black women are bald headed because of relaxer burns and then shit talked Madame C J Walker!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis nigga said he was a direct descendant of Frederick Douglass. If Frederick Douglass was resurrected he would slap this hotep piece of shit.\n\nHe talks in circles to further confuse those lost souls. He is the worst kind of black man because he has billed himself as someone who wants to help people but is only trying to help himself by robbing the most vulnerable. He wanna act like he hates hoteps but then describes bougie black people and calls it hotep.\n\nAnd he can't count!!! He started out saying that he had a six point plan on how to help your kid and yourself through\u2026some shit (shrug) but this spinning ass nigga never made it past the second point!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything is because black woman are bad people spending all our time trying to be European and turning against black men because of our brainwashing. We are addicted to weave and burning our scalp with relaxer.\n\nI wanted to just punch him in his Rick Ross light bearded ass face.\n\nAnd he saddest part was that that auditorium full of sensible looking lost negroes clapping like that bitch was spitting knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fuckshit ass nigga bitch had the nerve to open his mouth and say (I'm paraphrasing) that women let their children be affected by systemic racism in our public schools because when the time comes to see Little Ray Ray and Tay Tay's teacher we double booked the meeting and our weave appointment so we trying to get in and out. (He really did say Ray Ray and Tay Tay.) And THE WOMEN!!! Them clueless women clapped!!!! They nodded their head and LAUGHED!! They stood from their seats!\n\nOh and don't get me started on the Tupac Movie!\n\nMalaika: There was one moment, for me, where he started with what had the promise of being a good point. It was when he talked about the link between educational institutions and gentrification. Actually, it didn't start off making that much sense. He started off by saying that if he was a white man wanting to infiltrate a mostly black neighborhood he would open a charter school. And employ white teachers (Mrs. Lebronowski) who would then need to live the neighborhood, driving up property taxes and then take black homes using eminent domain. This point somehow got fused with another point about University-fueled gentrification which was when I found myself really tuning in. I think this thought resonated with me because it made me think of South Side Chicago and what happened when the University of Chicago started buying up properties. Over the course of just a few years, the neighborhood around U of C changed dramatically and there was some not so subtle animosity between the University and the few folk who managed to stay in the neighborhood after it changed. Needless to say, this was the one instance where even though Umar used a lot of overly-simplified logic, I had to grudgingly admit he had a point. But then immediately after he said all that, he launched into a tirade about black women and c sections and placenta and Shea butter and my \"this nigga here\" face came back swiftly and with a vengeance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine: The placenta!!!!!!\n\nI forgot about the placenta!!! He said the hospitals are stealing black women's placenta because of Henrietta Lacks.\n\nThat was almost as bad as the whole Tupac movie part!\n\nMalaika: Oh and then do you remember his thing about the Mormons in Utah stealing black peoples DNA because they own Ancestry.com? Actual. Tears. From. My. Actual. Eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine: Yes I remember. He wanted to let you know that if you pay him $50 he will call you and give you advice. But if you talk too much he'll take you money and hang up.\n\nSweet baby Jesus. He said that it's a sham and Black people only do the test to prove they are 7.5% Native American.\n\nOh but remember the property he put a down payment on in North Carolina where he's building his school? Where all the black boys will have all black male teachers and women can't get a job if they have a weave or a perm? SMH!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVSB: What was the crowd like?\n\nChristine: This is the shocker. They were normal black people! If you walked passed you would think it was a community outreach meeting or town hall. Most of them looked like they could be the neighbor you ask if it\u2019s okay to accept your UPS package while you are work-type. Most people were well dressed. No \u201cAshy is the new woke\u201d t-shirts.\n\nThere were a few outliers that had me wondering if they were in the right place. Like the presence of LGBTQ supporters especially since he says things like (once again paraphrasing) that the Black Male Genocide is being perpetrated through a sophisticated plan that involves Black boys being raised without their fathers who then turn into secret homosexuals and move to Atlanta where they are exposed to AIDS through the high population of gay people with AIDS in the city who will then pass it to Black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther than that the crowd was pretty cool. If I walked into iHop and saw this exact same crowd eating pancakes I wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow.\n\nMalaika: I second! If normal had a look, this crowd would be it. Black folks of various, shapes, sizes and complexions. Walking in I could hear a few folks speaking Spanish, others speaking Creole. There were some with accents I readily identified as Caribbean by way of Jamaica and Trinidad, but there were also others that I couldn't place. There were maybe one or two people who could pass for white folks up in the second row. He noticed them too, because at a point while launching into one of his crazy anecdotes he said something about having some white people in the audience and not meaning to offend. This I thought was funny considering how many times he referenced some unspecified brotha with his proverbial \"white wife.\" Or better yet his constant reference to \"Mrs. Lebronowski\" the white teacher whose sole purpose in life is to make sure your black sons end up in jail by his 21st birthday so that her husband the white police officer could keep his job through retirement.\n\nOh and Christine there was one flag bearer, although I suspect she might have been in league with \"the good doctor\" because halfway through the night he made a pitch for people to go and visit the flag vendor outside. Included in said pitch? \"If you got a white wife, go on get you a flag my brotha.\" SMH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut yeah, the audience seemed perfectly ordinary. I remember wondering to myself more than once if the folks in attendance were mostly members of Brown Memorial Baptist. I also remember thinking to myself that the folks who clapped most fervently for the bullshit seemed to be older.\n\nJoel: To be honest, it was the same crowd you'd find at a Jay-Z concert. Same crowd you'd find at a Dave Chappelle show. Same crowd you'd see at the bbq on Saturday when your aunt with arthritis shit on the whole fam with her awesome potato salad (don't asked who cut the potatoes, it's rude).\n\nNo daishikis, black power fists, afro pics, etc in sight. Now I remember why. He does not consider himself a hotep, just like most hoteps do not consider themselves as such. We are talking men and women ranging from 25 to 70. An eclectic crowd to say the least. It was Christine who pointed out every time he talked shit about hoteps, he was referring to his critics. Meaning Black folks who don't agree with him. US. WE ARE THE HOTEPS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if that's true in the eyes of those who follow him, we are too bougie to be worth the time. And if you think about any marginalized group, that is generally the belief they have of folks who don't sympathize with their plight.\n\nChristine: He told the crowd that he hates hoteps more than once.\n\nMalaika: There was definitely something hilariously/sadly circular about his logic. And I won't lie, more than once I had to ask myself where I would fall on the scale of one to Hotep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoel: If anything, the odd thing about Umar and his base is I don't believe for a second either side is stupid. He is intelligent. He's full of shit, but he is intelligent. Cunning and slick even. We've all seen someone like him. We have someone like that in our families: a know it all dude who decided he will never be wrong so he'll do anything you say he can't do, and even if he can't do it, he'll go full Republican on you and ignore all your points until you are exhausted. And his base are people who are sick of being ignored so they go with the direction of hearing what they want to hear, and will probably defend these points tooth and nail, despite them going against their best interest.\n\nActually that's it. Umar is Trump and his base is radical White America.\n\nChristine: Joel I said that when we were eating Mexican. I said that he is very Trump-esque because he uses a small vein of truth to start an idea but goes on wild tangents that ends up making his whole statement false.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus he is taking advantage of the marginalized and disenfranchised. So yeah he is Trump with a Boondocks make over.\n\nJoel: You're right, you did mention that.\n\nOnly reason someone's like him is worse than Trump is that he has no true success except what he's getting other people to believe. And he knows that's all he needs right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalaika: Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii am not so convinced that either one of those two niggas deserve the credit of intelligence. A certain level of ruthlessness? Yes. A disturbing talent for manipulation? Definitely. A large dose of \"Imma get mine by any means necessary\"? Absolutely. But intelligence? I don't think so. I think Umar and his Yin-Yang twin da Trumpinator fall short of real intelligence because they both have this puzzling mix of pridefulness AND shamelessness.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying the previously blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was actually described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel.

James\u2019 career is interesting in that he\u2019s considered a legend in two games, like Pee Wee Kirkland (his drug use was legendary back then), but the most significant part of his career happened between 1978 and 1985. As opposed to other larger-than-life artists whose hits spanned several decades, James made a really big splash over a relatively short amount of time.\n\nWith Motown and music legend Robinson in tow, James wrote an ode to black women that was slower tempo and more traditional R&B than most of his hits.\n\nWhile James was known for the punk-funk stylings of his larger hits, \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d saw him smooth it out and keep it mellow, mellow. Robinson and James traded stanzas, and most of the hook duties went to James, creating one of the absolutely most perfect karaoke songs of all time, since James\u2019 singing is more performance than it is good. And that\u2019s really what karaoke is all about. I love Rick James; that was not a shot.\n\nWhen James and Robinson really ramp up the energy toward the end of the song, this is when my soul fully embraces all that the song has to offer.

For those not in the know, it\u2019s a spinoff from hit ABC show Black-ish that focuses on Shahidi\u2019s character, Zoey, and her journey from super-sheltered private school student to college freshman in this millennial world. Comparisons to A Different World will undoubtedly exist, but fuck that shit. We\u2019re going to let Grown-ish bounce, rock, skate and roll on its own merits, and so far, I\u2019m in.\n\nThe debut episodes brought me back to my college days\u2014kinda; we\u2019ll get to that later\u2014while also infusing enough blackness to keep me interested and anticipating future episodes. Here is a list of 10 things that were awesome (and black) about the first two episodes of Grown-ish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with the most obvious. By a show of hands, how many of you had any idea that the show itself would be on the Freeform network or had even HEARD of Freeform? Nobody? Good. I\u2019m not alone here. It wasn\u2019t until about 7:55 p.m. that I was like ... wait, why for come Grown-ish isn\u2019t showing up on my DirecTV channel guide on ABC?\n\nThen I looked it up online and saw it was on Freeform, cocked my head to the side and said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Freeform?\u201d These niggas just gon\u2019 make us LOOK for new channels? That\u2019s some black shit. Turns out Freeform is an ABC Family network or something. I was annoyed until Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast came on after and all was right with the world. Be our guest and shit.\n\n2. The first two episodes were titled \u201cLate Registration\u201d and \u201cBitch Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d using the tried-and-true method of naming things after black songs. I\u2019m all in on that level of blackness. It\u2019s a subtle way to infuse blackness that uncool white people won\u2019t understand without the help of a Magical Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Within the FIRST minute, we get footage from Freaknic (RIP), the freakfest that hit its hedonistic stride in the \u201990s, taking over and shutting down the streets of Atlanta every spring, AND Luke\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Rock.\u201d We just hit meta blackness.\n\n4. B.o.B. and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s song \u201cThe Kids\u201d plays in the first episode. Bobby Ray is a flat-earther, which makes sure to get some Hotep-adjacent nonsense into the episode without making it so blatant. Well-played, Grown-ish. Well-played.\n\n5. I appreciate how Randy\u2019s Donuts\u2014Inglewood, Calif.\u2019s famous landmark shop\u2014has become synonymous with black Los Angeles for all of us outsiders. It\u2019s been in videos, movies and television shows as a marker of \u201cHey, we in the hood now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Grown-ish, sister singing duo Chloe x Halle play Skylar and Jazlyn Forster, two track stars from the hood (running, not hair)\u2014hence the shot of Randy\u2019s Donuts. What makes this especially black? Glad you asked. They\u2019re signed to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment imprint. We got Beyonc\u00e9 and Inglewood in one fell swoop, killing two black birds with one stone.\n\n6. Here\u2019s some extra-black shit of the \u201cFuck it, maybe nobody will notice\u201d variety: In the first episode, Vivek, the Indian kid who aspires toward Drakeness in life, is a label whore. That\u2019s fine; lots of us are. While they\u2019re showing us his label whoring, the show points out that his shoes are Adidas Yeezy 750 Boosts\u2014EXCEPT THEY\u2019RE NOT. They are Adidas, sure, but they\u2019re Pharrell\u2019s NMD Human Race red joints, an ENTIRELY different shoe. Oh, Grown-ish.\n\n7. They hit up a James Baldwin-themed photo exhibit. Two episodes into a show and we go straight for James Baldwin? Siiiiiiign me up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Zoey trying to knock out a paper on the Notorious RBG, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 1 a.m. and then 2 a.m. gave me actual nightmares. I recently told my boy\u2019s son, a soon-to-be high school graduate, that college was the best four years of my life and that I\u2019d go back, even with the work, and do it over. I think I forgot that \u201cdoing the work\u201d actually included writing papers again. I was NOTORIOUS for starting papers at midnight that were due at 8 a.m. and I NEVER LEARNED MY LESSON.\n\nI somehow managed to get a master\u2019s degree like this, culminating in a 50-page \u201cpaper,\u201d including a literature review, bibliography and fully cited sources, on how the government\u2019s HOPE VI housing program was a really good bad idea that displaced tons of black Americans in hopes of spurring gentrification because \u201cthe man\u201d\u2014that I wrote in 36 hours. What makes this a black-ass thing? I just mentioned gentrification. That\u2019s all I got.\n\n9. The character Luca\u2019s entire wardrobe looks inspired by the one and only Ghostface Killah, down to the rings, chains and the robelike clothing he sports in the second episode. He\u2019s who I should have been in college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I learned more about drugs in the second episode than I ever did in 38 years of life. Also, this is not true.

Despite this fact, blackness has flourished. We\u2019ve seen a resurgence of pride and excitement in blackness that is reminiscent of the Black Power movement of the \u201960s. From #BlackGirlMagic to #BlackBoyJoy, Dead Mike from mythical rap group CB4 is outchea looking like a damn prophet as so many of us have woken up this year and recited his famous chorus: \u201cI\u2019m black, y\u2019all, I\u2019m black, y\u2019all, I\u2019m blacker than black, and I\u2019m black, y\u2019all!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been blackness in 2017.\n\nYou see, it\u2019s not that black folks won\u2019t stop; it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t stop doing blackness like we\u2019re doing it for television. Over the course of 2017, circumstances have allowed for and presented themselves as ideal moments to always bet on black, per se. And collectively, we did not disappoint.\n\nHere is a list of the 10 blackest moments of 2017 (so far\u2014C.P. Time is a real thing, so we have a week left for the thunder and the rain to come down):\n\nLaVar Ball\u2019s appearance on CNN was equal parts \u201cFuck the man\u201d and \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Love him or hate him\u2014and he is easily one of the most polarizing people in America\u2014Ball basically went on television to tell the motherfucking PREZ-O-DEN \u201cFuck you and the horse Roy Moore rode in on\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing). And I don\u2019t care where you are or who you is; that\u2019s some black shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA film about the black experience won the Oscars\u2019 most coveted prize; and, of course, white folks tried to take it from them because that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be black in America. Moonlight was a film that spurred so many different types of conversations, from whether or not the film was any good (depends on whom you ask) to what the central theme of the movie even was (sexuality or manhood ... manhood, definitely), but when the dust settled, a movie about blackness was a central conversation piece AND the last film standing, and that\u2019s a hell of a win for African America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, 28 members of the Beta Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma Theta at FAMU decided to celebrate 10 years of sisterhood with a trip to Costa Rica. That trip resulted in a photoshoot seen round the world. Dubbed \u201cMelanin Illustrated,\u201d the women all wore similar-toned bathing suits and had all of us appreciating their beautiful blackness. I guess that\u2019s what Rotary Connection was singing about on \u201cI am the Black Gold of the Sun.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, keeping it real goes wrong, but sometimes keeping it real results in a black man using a motherfucking filing cabinet as a grill. I\u2019ve seen some black shit. Hell, I still carry around a Crown Royal bag to hold prized possessions (I really do this), but file-cabinet grilling? That\u2019s some black ingenuity on par with George Washington Carver\u2019s work with peanuts. Somebody get this man a Negritzer Prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Angela Rye responds to Omarosa Manigault being fired from her job at the White House.\n\nWords won\u2019t do this justice; you just need to watch the clip. This is master-class-level petty. This is what Merriam and Webster had in mind when they added \u201cpetty\u201d to the dictionary. Using a national stage to remind folks you have zero fucks to give? Super-Saiyan-level petty. Angela Rye, we salute you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Donald Glover thanks the Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d as part of his Golden Globes acceptance speech for Atlanta.\n\nDonald Glover had a hell of a year. His album Awaken, My Love! (released in December 2016) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. His hit television show, Atlanta, caught the hearts and minds of black America and won Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes in February. And what did Glover do in his thank-you speech? He thanked motherfucking Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d because it\u2019s, like, the best song ever. Migos, who are a black-ass group even down to their familial connections as both uncles and cousins and other super-black shit, saw a huge spike in streams and sales of the single after. That\u2019s paying the blessings forward, which is a black-ass way to give back in our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon Young already did a bang-up job explaining the 20 blackest moments of the Sharon Reed clapback video, so I won\u2019t reinvent the wheel. Finger pistols of death on live television. That\u2019s some black shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Issa Rae lets everyone know she\u2019s rooting for everybody black at the Emmys (2:49 mark in video).\n\nYou know how you can have some folks fucked up? You know who you NOT gon\u2019 have fucked up? Issa Rae. When asked who she was rooting for at the night\u2019s Emmys, she made it very clear that she was rooting for everybody black (probably one of THE truest statements of all time\u2014also applies to the Olympics, elections and nonblack movies with black characters), setting off a viral round of \u201cYaaaassssssssss\u201d and T-shirts and catapulting her right into position as everybody\u2019s favorite black person for a solid at-least-two weeks. Basically, she was the opposite of Omarosa. The ONLY reason this isn\u2019t No. 1 is because, well, blackness seeks its own level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Shannon Sharpe pulls out a Black & Mild and talks about bein\u2019 off that \u201cyak\u201d (Hen Dawg in particular) on The Undisputed, Fox Sports 1\u2019s live sports talk show.\n\nListen, Linda. Listen. Sharpe said he likes to celebrate with cigars and yak and put a Black in his mouth ON TELEVISION. Even Joy Taylor knows that Black & Milds aren\u2019t real cigars. But that didn\u2019t stop Sharpe from going on about his love for Hen Dawg and Milds. That, my friends, is blackness seeking its own level. Those are the moments in blackness you don\u2019t see coming, which makes them special. Blackness is not here for you; it\u2019s here for the shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

He garnered widespread exposure and critical praise after the release of his single \u201cRoss Capicchioni\u201d in 2015. In 2017, he released his fourth mixtape (and first on a major label), 508-507-2209. Joyner gained national attention when he appeared on the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher. He was the first artist to be moved from the web platform of the show to the televised syndication\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUm, do you even know who Joyner Lucas is? This sounds like it was lifted directly from his Wikipedia page.\n\nBecause it was. And to answer your first question, I know who Joyner Lucas is, and I\u2019ve known exactly who Joyner Lucas is for a little over 90 minutes now.\n\nSo basically you\u2019re doing an explainer about a rapper you literally just discovered today?\n\nYes. And that\u2019s no shade to Joyner Lucas, by the way. From what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s a pretty talented dude. I just don\u2019t listen to much new music or the radio at all. My Spotify playlist primarily comprises Kanye, movie scores (my favs: Jesus Christ Superstar and, surprisingly, Inception), Radiohead, Ghostface and, of course, Rick Ross for when I want to scare white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. So why are you writing about him today?\n\nA couple days ago, Lucas dropped \u201cI\u2019m Not Racist\u201d\u2014a now-viral video with 2.8 million views on YouTube and 24 million on Facebook. It depicts two men (one black and one white) sitting by themselves in what looks to be a warehouse, and each has the opportunity to air his racial grievances at the other.\n\nThe white man\u2014decked in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and \u201cregular-people\u201d clothes\u2014basically raps that black people are lazy, government-assistance-dependent criminals who use slavery as an excuse for our behavior and are more concerned with looking cool than taking care of our kids. Basically, everything we\u2019ve already heard on every message board, in every comment section and from every American politician ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he\u2019s done, the black man offers his rebuttal, which is ultimately that racism is the reason we\u2019re forced to do the things the white guy accuses us of doing. Throughout each verse, \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d is repeated like a singular chorus breaking up each stanza. The point? Neither of these men is racist. They just need\u2014and want\u2014to understand each other better.\n\nAnd when both men are done rapping, they hug.\n\nAlso, just because I anticipate some confusion here, Joyner Lucas is black and he\u2019s actually the one rapping both the white verse and the black verse.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty cool video.\n\nIt is, actually. It was produced well, and although the lyrics veer a little corny at times, you can feel the emotion and the rage bubbling through them. It\u2019s palpable. As is the thought and care Lucas very obviously put into creating this. I don\u2019t know if this is the type of song you\u2019d listen to on the radio or in the car\u2014it feels more like a spoken-word performance than an actual song\u2014but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intended to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what are your problems with it?\n\nThe most obvious part, after watching this three times now, is that the black guy\u2019s rebuttal is weak as fuck. The white guy spits all of the Breitbart and Bannon talking points, and the black guy cites ... Tupac? Sure, he also does mention how historical structural racism makes him feel, as if he\u2019s living in a \u201cfrying pan.\u201d But his overall rebuttal is more \u201cRacism is why I do these bad things\u201d and not \u201cActually, most of us don\u2019t do those bad things you think we all do.\u201d He basically returned shrapnel fire with a spitball.\n\nAlso, it shouldn\u2019t even exist.\n\nThe entire video?\n\nYes.\n\nI thought you just said it was cool.\n\nI did. But it\u2019s cool the same way two bags of Cheetos can alleviate hunger. It\u2019s an empty coolness because the concept\u2014the song and the video\u2014is based on a faulty premise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s that?\n\nThat white people\u2019s race-related gripes and black people\u2019s race-related gripes are equal\u2014equally justified and deserving of equal time and attention. They are not. There is no conversation that needs to happen between the races in order to create some measure of truce and racial conciliation. The only conversation that can do that is white people talking to other white people to try to find a way to be less awful to black people. (Also, saying \u201cHey, stop discriminating against and hating and killing us\u201d is not asking for a truce. Just for them to stop doing what they\u2019re doing so we can breathe.)\n\nYes, it would be great if whites and blacks came together on some kumbaya shit. But there\u2019s no meeting in the middle here. There\u2019s no finding a common ground. They have to come where we already are, and they have to recognize, acknowledge and begin to make amends for why the separation exists in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me put it this way: How offensive and absurd would it be if, instead of a black person and a white person having this conversation, it was a Jewish person and a Nazi?\n\nUm, that analogy doesn\u2019t work. No one would dare do something like that.\n\nActually, the analogy works specifically because no one in their right mind would dare do something like that. We give the Holocaust the respect it deserves. We recognize the horror of what happened to Jewish people and the evil of the Nazis. (Well, we generally do these things.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut America doesn\u2019t give the centuries-long trans-Atlantic slave trade the same acknowledgment. The analogy doesn\u2019t seem to work because our country doesn\u2019t believe it was as serious and destructive and transformative and evil as the Holocaust was. And we still don\u2019t fully acknowledge the pervasive residue of slavery and the metaphysical construct and constraint of racism still existing today. We haven\u2019t reckoned with that evil and that violence. And because of that, the thought behind videos like \u201cI\u2019m Not Racist\u201d exists.\n\nThe message on-screen at the end of the video provides a perfect snapshot of the faultiness of this premise. It states, \u201cWe were all humans until race disconnected us, religion separated us, politics divided us, and wealth classified us.\u201d It\u2019s fulfilling and uplifting in the same bag-of-Cheetos way. But this video is dealing specifically with American race relations between black Americans and white Americans. And saying \u201cuntil race disconnected us\u201d removes the very active role white people had in creating race specifically to disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe weren\u2019t disconnected by race. We were disconnected by people who deemed themselves white. And that acknowledgment fucking matters, man. It\u2019s not some nonessential detail. It\u2019s the only one that matters.\n\nDamn. Well, anything else?\n\nI actually do appreciate what Joyner Lucas attempted to do here. And I\u2019d appreciate it even more if he read some bell hooks and Kiese Laymon and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw and Ta-Nehisi Coates and Toni Morrison and Derrick Bell and tried again.", "keywords": ["im", "lucas", "joyner", "racist", "race", "dont", "doing", "explained", "hes", "white", "black", "way", "problems", "racism"], "polarity": -0.002419074919074912, "subjectivity": 0.4323432523432523},

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

And it is not lost on me that when given a choice between the two, the Recording Academy loves to reward music that sounds black without rewarding actual black people.\n\nIn fact, since 2008, only one black person has won best album at this award show, and I would argue that Herbie Hancock won because he was paying homage to a beloved, soulful white woman. In the past 10 years, more often than not, black artists were shafted by the academy and forced to watch someone with an inferior, less important album take the award that was rightfully theirs. Let\u2019s look back at the Grammys\u2019 10-year record of undervaluing (mostly black) talent.\n\n\n\n2007\n\nWon: Herbie Hancock\u2019s River: The Joni Letters\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black\n\n\n\nThis is the one album by a white artist that I could not deny. This was a powerhouse performance from start to finish. Not a single track is a misstep, and it is all the more powerful knowing how little work we would get from this once-in-a-generation talent. I still mourn the work we did not get from Winehouse while celebrating the art she left behind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008\n\nWon: Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 Raising Sand\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Lil Wayne\u2019s Tha Carter III\n\n\n\nTha Carter III was the album on which Wayne lived up good to his claim of being the best rapper alive. While none of his studio albums have the transcendental feel of his best mixtapes, this is the one that came the closest.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2009\n\nWon: Taylor Swift\u2019s Fearless\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kanye West\u2019s 808s & Heartbreak\n\n\n\nYe redefined what was possible for a hip-hop artist with 808s & Heartbreak. Gone were his witty lyrics and catchy, soulful beats. Instead, he used the medium of Auto-Tune to express his pain while using the androidlike sound to hide emotions a black man, much less a rapper, was not allowed to feel. It is hip-hop\u2019s best brown-liquor album.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2010\n\nWon: Arcade Fire\u2019s The Suburbs\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Drake\u2019s Thank Me Later\n\n\n\nDrake\u2019s first studio album features what we have come to expect from the man who is rarely in but always repping Toronto: slick production, clever lyrics and aloof masculinity masked as emotional vulnerability. For better or worse, this set the tone for much of the music that was to come for the next five years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2011\n\nWon: Adele\u2019s 21\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kanye West\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n\n\n\nYes, Adele\u2019s album was dope, but in 2012, Kanye released one of the best albums of all time. \u201cRunaway\u201d is one of the most ambitious songs ever attempted, hip-hop or otherwise, and \u201cLost in the World\u201d is a track that transcends categorization. MBDTF, even with its flaws, is a masterpiece and the strongest argument for why Kanye is one of the most important artists in the last 25 years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012\n\nWon: Mumford & Sons\u2019 Babel\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange\n\n\n\nI like an album full of philosophical folk songs as much as the next guy, but Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange was monumental. It is an almost perfect album that rewards tarrying with Ocean\u2019s vulnerable lyrical and sonic atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2013\n\nWon: Daft Punk\u2019s Random Access Memories\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\n\n\n\nDaft Punk\u2019s second-best album beat Lamar\u2019s best record to date for best album that year. In 2012, Kung Fu Kenny introduced himself to most of the world with this ambitious, literary concept album that bangs while it challenges the listener. This joint didn\u2019t even win best rap album that year. Proof, if you ever needed it, that you should not put too much stock in white validation of black art.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2014\n\nWon: Beck\u2019s Morning Phase\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\n\n\n\nDo you remember the way Beyonc\u00e9 broke the internet with this album? How America collectively lost sleep one night on Dec. 13, 2013, streaming it, in shock that we\u2019d been blessed with an early Christmas gift? It was not the first \u201csurprise album,\u201d but it was the one that set industry standards about how to release in the streaming era. Why this lost to Beck is beyond me. I liked Morning Phase, but nothing on it made the cultural impact of Bey\u2019s surfboard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2015\n\nWon: Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989\n\n\n\nBest album that year: D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Black Messiah\n\n\n\nThis could have gone to Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly, but for me, Black Messiah should have won the award that year. His sound was both rustic and virtuosic, while the lyrics were urgent without being inaccessible. This was the soul protest album we didn\u2019t know we needed, the rare album that lives up to the multiyear hype.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016\n\nWon: Adele\u2019s 25\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade\n\n\n\nThis point was made by virtually everyone last year.

Adding insult to injury, there\u2019s even a segment of black men who consider \u201cthe most educated group in the United States\u201d the least desirable.\n\nThese opinions\u2014or \u201cpreferences,\u201d as misogynoirists often call them\u2014originate in racist beliefs that black women are outside the classical concept of womanhood. This \u201cothering\u201d relies on stereotypes of black women as \u201cangry,\u201d \u201cunwomanly\u201d or \u201cmanly\u201d when compared with women of other races. Yet those of us who represent the lifestyle known as \u201cdapper\u201d simultaneously embrace and challenge those stereotypes.\n\nFrom 1920s-era performer Gladys Bentley to 2017 Emmy Award-winning writer Lena Waithe, black women donning menswear have continually asserted themselves in the intersecting conversations of gender identity, fashion and race. We boldly respond to Truth\u2019s query with a resounding, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\nThese conversations inevitably revolve around being \u201cmasculine of center\u201d (MoC), an umbrella term that encompasses all the nuanced characteristics outside of \u201ctraditional\u201d femininity\u2014from the tomboy to the butch/stud. \u201cDapper,\u201d when applied to any and all gender identities, denotes a style of dress noted as much for its precision in execution as its play in pairing. For people of the African Diaspora, it intersects with a cultural history of dandyism best described by Ekow Eshun, curator of the photography exhibit \u201cMade You Look: Dandyism and Black Masculinity.\u201d He describes it as \u201cradical personal politics, a willed flamboyance that flies in the face of conventional constructions of the black masculine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a dapper queer woman, I\u2019m the beneficiary of evolving social constructs of gender that have far-reaching roots. For instance, to simply say that Harlem Renaissance blues singer Gladys Bentley was a \u201cdrag king\u201d is to rely on the limits of language and time. Bentley, an open lesbian, dressed in menswear and sang blues songs about female lovers. In the 1920s, she was described as \u201cperforming maleness,\u201d yet Bentley enjoyed same-sex relationships and wore suits and ties offstage, as well. And though gender theorist Judith Butler argues that we\u2019re always performing gender in various ways\u2014including what we wear\u2014perhaps it\u2019s fairer to say Bentley was not performing but, rather, presenting herself as a dapper black woman singing songs of her lesbian experience in an unevolved era.\n\nThe misconception that some women dress in suits and ties to either be or imitate men ironically imitates social systems that center men in all things. Speaking for myself, I enjoy the look and feel of how my particular womanhood expresses itself through this style of dress. It isn\u2019t manhood or maleness, but masculinity\u2014a trait most associated with men but not exclusive to them\u2014that I present as a dapper woman. But my affinity for oxfords and bowties have absolutely nothing to do with men.\n\nAs Janelle Mon\u00e1e clapped back at a Twitter user who complained about being \u201ctired of those dumbass suits\u201d she favors: \u201cSit down. I\u2019m not for male consumption.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMenswear and menswear-inspired clothing embrace masculinity, but not necessarily as a rejection of the feminine. Mon\u00e1e epitomizes style as statement; using her wardrobe of suits, bowties and monochromatic colors to honor both her and her parents\u2019 uniformed pasts as domestic workers. Similarly, every Eldredge knot I tie and wingtip I slip into honors and frees a little tomboy in late-\u201970s, early-\u201980s Chicago, forced into stiff lace-ruffled dresses with matching socks and hand-me-down rabbit fur coats.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only budding dapper queer suffocating through girlhood on Chicago\u2019s predominantly black South Side. Recent Emmy winner Lena Waithe\u2019s historymaking episode \u201cThanksgiving\u201d on Netflix\u2019s Master of None serves as an accurate and humorous primer on black queer girlhood. In fact, I watched it with my mother and aunt this Thanksgiving, along with the pilot episode of my own comedy web series, Quare Life (Open TV, beta, 2018).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, these two episodes feature characters rarely represented in a setting often misrepresented: masculine-of-center black women on Chicago\u2019s South Side. If Judith Butler is correct in positing that gender is made up of actions we\u2019ve been socialized to do, maybe coming of age during the rise of hip-hop\u2014which spawned as many unisex fashion trends as misogynist rhymes\u2014influenced Waithe, me and countless girls like us to evolve from baggy sweats and bandannas to tuxedos and bow ties.\n\nMaybe, like Mon\u00e1e, we dress this way as a statement; paying homage to generations of black girls viewed as masculine by default. But more likely, part of #BlackGirlMagic is to slay in whatever we wear, demanding that onlookers and critics recognize who we are, even when it defies convention. Maybe that\u2019s why, when referencing her Emmy-night tuxedo, Lena Waithe said, \u201cI felt like the queen of the night in that thing.\u201d\n\nM Shelly Conner is a Chicago-based writer, humorist and scholar.

The words change subtly to achieve the desired affects. White people get an \u201cepidemic\u201d while black people get a \u201cplague.\u201d The word plague ever so delicately indicates that the inky black pestilence slithering its way through black neighborhoods is our fault while an epidemic\u2026well, an epidemic could befall any innocent bystander.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVann Newkirk recently articulated this distinction in The Atlantic\n\nFrom \"What The 'Crack Baby' Panic Reveals About The Opioid Epidemic\"\n\n\n\nThe article is an exemplar in a field of public-health-oriented writing about the opioid crisis\u2014the most deadly and pervasive drug epidemic in American history\u2014that has shaped popular and policy attitudes about the crisis. But the wisdom of that field has not been applied equally in recent history. The story of Jamie Clay and Jay\u2019la Cy\u2019anne stood out to me because it is so incongruous with the stories of \u201ccrack babies\u201d and their mothers that I\u2019d grown up reading and watching. The term itself still stings. \u201cCrack baby\u201d brings to mind hopeless, damaged children with birth defects and intellectual disabilities who would inevitably grow into criminals. It connotes inner-city blackness, and also brings to mind careless, unthinking black mothers who\u2019d knowingly exposed their children to the ravages of cocaine. Although the science that gave the world the term was based on a weak proto-study of only 23 children and has been thoroughly debunked since, the panic about \u201ccrack babies\u201d stuck. The term made brutes out of people of color who were living through wave after wave of what were then the deadliest drug epidemics in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when I see these stories, I remember whole black neighborhoods blighted by crack and the toll that it took and is still taking in black neighborhoods.\n\nAnd then I remember\u2026\n\nFew years back, a friend of mine hit me upside the head and told me I needed to get it together. My life was falling apart and, whether you believe it or not, there comes a certain time in every person\u2019s life where being high all the time ain\u2019t cute no more for you or anybody else in your life and off to rehab I went. Reluctantly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many ways, rehab is a lot like how it's depicted in the movies. You wander white hallways in your pajamas and there are endless group therapy sessions and tedious meetings with counselors about \u201cgetting to the bottom\u201d of your problem. But, mostly it\u2019s boring. After the novelty of the free Jello wears off, you don\u2019t have much to do except not get high and this is the time when you really get to meet people. My rehab was a United Nations of junkies. We had good ol\u2019 boys, and debutante Beckys. We had Jew, Gentile, and Heathen. White, black, brown, and undeclared skin tones from different backgrounds and different economic brackets. White trophy wives whose \u201cwine with lunch\u201d took on a life of its own and consumed them and we all got along. We all talked. We all became fast and intimate friends. We all got to know one another and we all helped one another and ugly cried in each other\u2019s presence. Everyone had an ugly story. My roommate was a white yokel from way back and we talked about our problems until the wee hours and I liked him. You make temporary but deep friendships in rehab because you are at your most desperate. Your saddest. And when I raise my middle finger to all the white people overdosing across the country, I am forced to remember this. And then I have to think and allow my memories to soften my position. \u201cNot all of them are bad\u201d I have to tell myself.\n\nIt doesn't seem like most white people think like this, though. No matter what happens to them, they allow their delusions of superiority to take over. They\u2019re addicted to it. It\u2019s more comforting to them than lunch wine and more powerful than Oxycontin. They don\u2019t reflect because they don\u2019t have to. I am the one who is stuck having to think things through until my basic humanity takes the wheel.\n\nAfter rehab, I have held on to all my friends of color from that period in our lives. All of them. I have had to dump most of the white ones due to their support of Trump and have come to the realization that rehab was the great equalizer. White people have to be brought low in order to exhibit humanity and I have no doubt that if I stepped on to an elevator with one of those trophy wives today she would snatch her purse to her bosom and cradle it like it was a bottle of Malbec. And I\u2019ll have to be the one to remember and know that centuries of deluded and hateful thinking are far more powerful than any drug could ever hope to be.", "keywords": ["peoples", "stint", "epidemic", "dont", "life", "rehab", "feelings", "crack", "white", "black", "way", "think", "taught", "pain", "term"], "polarity": 0.03453514739229026, "subjectivity": 0.47948129251700683},

Kelly because, at this point, on the seventeenth day of July in 2017, there's not much I can say about R. Kelly that hasn't already been said. And repeated. And reported on. And recounted through anecdote. And even said by me on this very space four years ago.\n\n\n\nWith other artists guilty of criminal behavior, there can be a certain cognitive dissonance that can happen when the art and the unseemly acts by the artist have no connection. R. Kelly\u2019s music doesn\u2019t allow for that. His art and his actions are irrevocably linked. They can not be unlinked. It\u2019s like shoes and soles. Or Knick fans and disappointment. He makes crazy, nasty, deviant sex music because he\u2019s a crazy, nasty sex deviant. These are not two separate parts of him.\n\nAnd also because R. Kelly is who he is. A talented musician \u2014 a person actually considered by many to be the most talented contemporary musician \u2014 and a man who, for years, used his considerable wealth and influence and status to prey on young Black girls. And continues to do so.\n\nThe word evil isn't often employed when characterizing him, because using that term to describe someone so popular, talented, charismatic, and handsome seems counterintuitive. Troubled? Maybe. Conflicted? Perhaps. Complicated? Definitely. Evil, however, seems to be taking it too far. But the acts he committed are plainly and patently evil. Shit, while attempting to quantify evil is usually a fool's errand, there aren't many evils more evil than a rich and powerful man sexually violating poor and powerless girls. And then vaingloriously teasing us about it because he knows there's not much we can do about it.\n\nWhich is why today, on the seventeenth day of July in 2017, I can't help but wonder if fans of R. Kelly today in 2017 just might be evil too. Or, at the very least, evil adjacent. The fans upset that other people dare be disgusted by R. Kelly. The fans still paying hundreds of dollars to attend his shows. The fans who twist themselves into logical origami defending him, still. The fans who still say things like \"R. Kelly can still get it\" and \"Those girls knew what they were doing.\" The fans who parade him at concerts and honor him at awards shows. (And yes, this includes the peers who still make music with him.) The fans completely aware of his misdeeds but still completely apathetic to and unaffected by them. The fans \u2014 all of them \u2014 so enamored with and attached to R. Kelly the artist and his songs about sex that no evil act committed by R. Kelly, the person, matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps evil is too strong of a word to describe someone conscious of it who remains intentionally indifferent to it and arrogant about the indifference. But I can't think of a better one. So if you can, please do.\n\nIf you're wondering why the above may have sounded vaguely familiar \u2014 like you've read it somewhere before \u2014 it's because, if you've been a VSB reader for at least two years, you probably have. I wrote pretty much this exactly same thing in 2015; the only edits where I updated the year from 2015 to 2017. I didn't change anything because \u2014 despite the horrific Buzzfeed story today about R. Kelly's multi-state cult and the several sex slaves caught in it (that line italicized to represent the WTF!!!-ness of this all) \u2014 nothing has changed. He is who he is. And now, in 2017, we have over two decades worth of evidence of his criminal and criminal-adjacent sexual behavior. He hasn't stopped because he has no incentive to stop. If anything, DeRogatis's report shows that he's just become better at it. A craftsmen who surpassed the ten thousand hours of practice master threshold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR. Kelly is an evil man who has preyed on Black women and girls for 25 years now. Maybe longer. And will not stop until he's imprisoned. Or killed. If you still defend him and your fandom, that's your right I guess. Just admit that enjoying his music matters more to you than what he's done. And what he's doing. And what he'll continue to do.", "keywords": ["2017", "youre", "evil", "r", "kelly", "fans", "hes", "worse", "girls", "today", "fan", "person", "sex", "music"], "polarity": -0.09034960819770944, "subjectivity": 0.6136196503918023},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints. With furs and leather goods designed for the last 50 years by Karl Lagerfeld in collaboration with the Fendi sisters, it\u2019s fashions oldest and longest-lasting collaboration, but the point of view is always fashion-forward and fresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFall/Winter 2018 at Fendi felt like streetwear cool meets a socialite from Wakanda\u2019s Jabari tribe on a Swiss ski holiday in Gstaad. Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment. I like the moment we\u2019re in; #BlackGirlMagic casting its spell on the runways and women dressing to seize their power worldwide.\n\nFendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) Fendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) Fendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) Fendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) Fendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) Fendi Fall/Winter 2018 (Victor Virgile/Getty Images) 1 / 6\n\nMax Mara makes beautiful clothes that work for working women. But the collection never quite seems to get its props, likely because the label lacks the flash of a star designer or the power derived from dressing celebrities necessary for a fashion house to capture a place in pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do like its take on dressing women\u2014it\u2019s sensible and sexy in the same breath\u2014with wonderful choices for women who wear the hijab. Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016. Now beautiful models with conservative beliefs are taking their turn and their respect as they walk the runways.\n\nMax Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I said, I like the moment we\u2019re in right now: a movement toward inclusion, and celebrating power on the runways.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are.

Until every man is fighting for our rights, we should consider stopping having sex.\u201d \u2014Janelle Mon\u00e1e\n\nCome again? In a recent interview with Marie Claire, singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e discussed her ideas when it comes to participating in resistance. I\u2019m not going to lie: As a hot-blooded, fully grown and liberated woman who is in both her sexual prime and a happily grown-and-sexy relationship, reading this quote from one of Marie Claire\u2019s newest cover girls gave me serious pause (and a possible eyeball sprain). For all its noble\u2014albeit idealistic\u2014intention, my entire body recoiled at this stream of logic (aside from its being a wholly unappealing concept).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMon\u00e1e may presumably be willing to give up her interactive \u201cYoga\u201d habit until all of mankind is fighting for and alongside womankind, but suggesting that we wait until men get on board, en masse? With all due respect to her vagina\u2014and utmost respect for my own\u2014I felt cobwebs beginning to form at the mere thought ...\n\nOf course, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s position (pun intended) isn\u2019t a novel one. From the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata\u2014which inspired Spike Lee\u2019s controversial film Chi-raq\u2014to Poland\u2019s most recent iteration of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as an anti-abortion protest, withholding sex has long been considered potentially the ultimate weapon, capable of compelling social change, ending violence and asserting female power. Admittedly, the results have been mixed; but it\u2019s a resistance tactic that continues to resurface, increasingly in the name of feminism, since sex is often considered a \u201cgendered activity.\u201d\n\nSee? There\u2019s that pesky record scratch again. How do I count the ways in which this is problematic for me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Problem of the Pussy\n\nWell, let\u2019s start with the obvious, which, ironically, is reducing women\u2019s worth quite literally to the sum of their parts. As much as we extol the much-lauded \u201cpower of the pussy,\u201d are women\u2014who statistically suffer the highest percentage of sexual assaults\u2014really expected to (still) consider our sexual availability our best bargaining tactic? Does the \u201cDay Without a (Vagina)\u201d approach truly advance any conversation about female liberation? And specifically, when the agency and autonomy of our bodies is still actively up for debate, is dangling sex like a carrot really our best argument? Is our humanity not enough to justify our rights?\n\nThe Ms. in \u201cMisogyny\u201d\n\nAs much as I personally respect the yoni, let\u2019s be honest: #NotAllWomen do. Fifty-three percent of white women made that abundantly clear last November. Truthfully, the women\u2019s movement has so much work to do on itself that convincing men to act in our best interests is only part of the problem. Inclusion, intersectionality and misogyny are not just male issues; multitudes of women exclude, fear and outright hate other women\u2014enough to vote against ourselves and/or other women\u2019s autonomy, long after fighting to get the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd truth be told, for every male armchair pundit advising that women think more like men in order to get one, there\u2019s a woman teaching other women that they aren\u2019t fit to be mated (to a man, at least) without \u201cwife school.\u201d So much for sisterhood.\n\n#NotAllMen\n\nAs much as I\u2019d like to keep this centered on the women, let\u2019s address men for a second. You know, the hypothetical men from whom we heterosexual women (because apparently none of this logic applies to same-sex, non-gender-binary, etc., relationships) should be withholding sex until they\u2014and all their comrades\u2014get with the program. As Mon\u00e1e states (and I wholeheartedly agree): \u201cI love men. But evil men? I will not tolerate that. You don\u2019t deserve to be in my presence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUndoubtedly, not every man deserves access to the good stuff, including our pussy-grabber-in-chief. But if not all women unilaterally respect the vagina, it\u2019s equally true that #NotAllMen disrespect it\u2014or the women attached. And no, I\u2019m not talking solely about card-carrying, self-proclaimed \u201cmale feminists\u201d who\u2019ve made themselves known as of late. Admittedly, the jury\u2019s still out on a lot of those dudes.\n\nBut what about your average, respects-his-mama/sister/ex-girlfriends, secure-enough-in-his-nontoxic-masculinity-to-find-feminism-nonthreatening, believes-in-equal-rights-because-it\u2019s-basic-common-sense dude? Frankly, there are far more of them than flag-waving, possibly trend-riding male feminists, and while they may not be schooled on feminist theory, in my experience, they\u2019re often willing to learn. Should we not be willing to teach them (night classes, anyone)? Which leads me to my next concern:\n\nWhose Pussy Is This?\n\nPerhaps the most unnerving part of \u201cLysistratic nonaction,\u201das it is called in feminist resistance circles, is the concept of sex as a \u201cgendered activity,\u201d rather than as a mutual\u2014and, ideally, equal\u2014exchange between consenting adults. Personally, I consider sex as much of a human right as anything else. But more important, giving up that right is a concession to the same oppressive patriarchy we\u2019re fighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s using sex as a weapon against a system that already sexually objectifies women. To me, it sounds like another attempt to use the master\u2019s tools to dismantle the master\u2019s house (shoutout to Audre Lorde). I know the worth of my womanhood; I refuse to punish myself or concede my sexual power (or pleasure) to those already intent on ignoring it.\n\nBut I will conduct my due diligence. As Mon\u00e1e says, \u201cI have learned there is power in saying no. I have agency. I get to decide.\u201d And discernment is key. Not all masculinity is toxic. Not all women are feminists. But for those of us who both consider ourselves feminists/womanists and choose to share our bodies\u2014and lives\u2014with men, our commitment to feminism is inextricable from our commitment to those men. With whom we choose to share ourselves reflects that commitment. And yes, sometimes that means saying no.\n\nTo Mon\u00e1e\u2019s credit, she recognizes this also, and she has since clarified her controversial statement in a series of tweets explaining that, no, she doesn\u2019t believe sex is a bargaining tool:", "keywords": ["womens", "women", "sexual", "consider", "romance", "willing", "men", "male", "power", "resistance", "sex", "respect"], "polarity": 0.14658908507223117, "subjectivity": 0.4967763509898342},

After writing about the season finale of Insecure last week, I wanted to move on to other topics for discussion. But then, at last night\u2019s Emmys, Rae, in a moment of candor, found a way to make all her fans proud to be a part of the #IssaHive. When asked who she was rooting for, she responded, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing shocking about this statement to anybody who has grown up black and rooted for damn near anything in their life. It is a mantra for any of us who have watched any competition in which one of the competitors looks like us, sounds like us or is familiar to us.\n\nI remember as a kid watching shows like Family Feud, Double Dare and even American Gladiators, competitions in which there were absolutely zero stakes for me, and if there was a black competitor, I was rooting for them. Back then, I never thought deeply about this sort of fan appreciation. My rationale was simple: Black contestants, even on shows like the ones I mentioned, were rare, and therefore, rooting for them was done more out of a feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it then, I probably wasn\u2019t going to get another chance.\n\n\n\nBut in hindsight, I realized that part of my thinking was programmed by the way I would learn about black history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe way black history is taught to us in school is through the guise of firsts. From a very early age, most of the black people we learn about are put under a lens of exceptionalism. We learn about a black person who overcame a system of oppression and racism to become the first black person to accomplish everything from being the first African-American world heavyweight champion (Jack Johnson) to sitting at the front of a bus (Rosa Parks), and even those stories are sometimes distorted (shoutout to Claudette Colvin), but I digress.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of conditioning that lends itself to our cheering for our own out of solidarity. As Scoop Jackson once said, anytime you hear about a first black person winning or accomplishing anything of note, it is a reminder that racism exists. Issa Rae\u2019s statement last night exemplified that.\n\n\n\nAlready there are people who took Rae\u2019s words as racist, but in fact, her comment was rooting against racism. When Issa said she was rooting for everybody black, she was rooting for a new history to be made. She was rooting for Lena Waithe (Master of None) to be the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She was rooting for Donald Glover (Atlanta) to be the first black person to win for comedy-series directing. She was rooting for Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us) to be the first black actor since 1998 to win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for the same reasons I grew up rooting for Tiger Woods, Venus and Serena Williams, Barack Obama and any black contestant I saw on Jeopardy, Issa Rae was rooting for Donald Glover, Lena Waithe and Sterling K. Brown. There are so few of us in spaces like the Emmys that we rarely ever get the chance to root for us. So when we see us in those spaces, we may not know the full backstory, but we do know the history, and we\u2019re rooting for it to change.", "keywords": ["im", "raes", "history", "win", "rae", "fubu", "person", "learn", "black", "way", "racism", "issa", "rooting", "everybody"], "polarity": 0.09541889483065953, "subjectivity": 0.4461115355233002},

Although most of the criticisms about Dr. Umar Johnson seem to be valid, the one that makes me feel a certain way is how hard some of you degreed niggas are going in on his supposed lack of a doctorate. It seems elitist and classist; as if only a Black person with those credentials is allowed a platform.\n\nHmm. I can actually see how it might seem that way, as geographically incorrect Africa medallion soaked in Thunderbird with sentience \"Dr.\" Umar Johnson's claim that he forgot to renew his PhD paperwork was met with unparalleled glee and mirth. Niggas had more fun with that than we do at Six Flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that's more about the fact that it exposed his particular convergence of falsehoods than any sort of classism and anti-Blackness.\n\nEh. Maybe your claims would be more valid if it weren't true that these same jokes at Johnson's expense were made from your iPhones and Macbooks (created by college dropout Steve Jobs) and published on Facebook (created by college dropout Mark Zuckerberg). I guess its only cool when White dudes don't have the degrees.\n\nYou're still missing the point. It's not about whether Johnson has one. There are tons of laudable and respect-worthy niggas sans degrees. Jesus, for instance, didn't even have a GED. And it's not like degrees are some automatic dispenser of wisdom. It issue is that he lied \u2014 and still continues to lie \u2014 about having a PhD. And that the lie was conceived out of the same bucket of swirling and swindling fuckshit that his mythical connection to Frederick Douglass and his claims that he's the world's most requested scholar were born out of. His life is a microwave-friendly tray of lie manicotti, and the false degrees are just the cheese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis makes sense, but it still doesn't explain why some of y'all are going so hard on that.\n\nWell, Black people who did manage to earn an advanced degree know that shit wasn't easy. They remember the years devoted to school; the countless hours studying and editing and experimenting and writing and submitting. They remember the myriad roadblocks in their way. The schools in the middle of fucking nowhere they may have had to attend. The blatantly racist classmates. The blatantly racist faculty and advisers they may have had to prove themselves to. The rejections of their theories and work; the doubts of their work ethics and intelligence; the relentless self-doubting and questioning if they should just quit school and get a \"real job.\" The student loans still chasing them around; attached to them like a fart stuck to a cheap blouse. The disrespectful post-degree job offers.\n\nAnd so, after dealing with all of that, it's not hard to see why they'd be especially harsh towards someone who rolls up like \"Yup.

And the fire on the grill gets too hot. And someone takes a bucket of water and splashes it on the grill. And then that person decides to get a fireman's Halloween costume from Party City, and starts calling himself a fireman. Even starts going on panels with the costume to talk about fire. And then people on Facebook listen to his speeches, and start saying things like \"This dude knows everything about fire! He's a motherfuckin Fire Maven!\" And then he starts calling himself The World's Most Requested Fireman, and starts a GoFundme to finance his own fire station.\n\nAnd then, as a response to a friend lauding his fire genius and fire bravery, you say, \"Well, actually\u2026he's not really a fireman.\" And then you get accused of being a fire coon by his followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou'd feel a certain way about that, right?\n\nI guess so.\n\nExactly!", "keywords": ["hard", "degrees", "niggas", "advanced", "going", "having", "explained", "hate", "work", "fireman", "lie", "way", "worlds", "starts"], "polarity": 0.07927342132505177, "subjectivity": 0.4995600414078675},

The late, great singer is exuberant and full of life in the video, but the campiness of the direction is too much to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cYou Are Not Alone,\u201d by Michael Jackson\n\nThe King of Pop was a music-video auteur. \u201cThriller,\u201d \u201cBad,\u201d \u201cBeat It\u201d: They are classics.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, but a man can dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cMust Be the Money,\u201d by Deion Sanders\n\nThis begins with a flashback of him wearing a fake Jheri-curl wig as he rhymes the words nine and dotted line. Then it transitions into a four-minute montage of Primetime looking into the mirror admiring himself as women fawn over him. We could call this the first reality show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cPut Your Mouth on Me,\u201d by Eddie Murphy\n\nI cannot overstate how big Eddie Murphy was in the \u201980s. After 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop and Raw, he was so powerful that dude released a trash song and it went to No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song that was the inspiration for this video, however, was off the second, less successful album, So Happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, the song is about what you think, and Murphy spends the entire song either lying on a couch looking like a knockoff Prince Hakim or standing on a stage giving googly eyes to the camera, channeling Prince. This is a poor man\u2019s Michael Jackson video.\n\n2. \u201cThe Rain,\u201d by Oran Juice Jones\n\nThis is most known for the words \u201cYou gotta get on outta here with that\n\nalley-cat-coat-wearin\u2019 hush-puppy-shoe-wearin\u2019 crumb cake I saw you with \u2026 ,\u201d but the video is just as absurd as those lyrics. In fact, this could be a toxic-black-masculinity tutorial. He stalks her and uses money to assert power, all while wearing flawless makeup and never standing in the rain despite singing about precipitation and wearing a raincoat. This would be No. 1 if not for the red gloves in \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Any Further,\u201d by Dennis Edwards\n\nThe red-gloved hands that seem to be disembodied, the backdrop, the gum he chews throughout, the wink, the faces he makes. This is the best worst video in every possible way. The song bumps, but the video is so bad in so many amazing ways that it deserves to be on repeat at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. I wonder if the great Timothy Anne Burnside can hook that up. I have only one question: What brand of gum was Dennis chewing in the video?", "keywords": ["best", "song", "videos", "ranked", "wearing", "red", "fact", "black", "note", "bad", "michael", "worst", "video"], "polarity": 0.11179364154364155, "subjectivity": 0.5988330311663644},

I loved that song as most people did. Jidenna as an artist, though, I was ambivalent about. Sure it was a dope song, but how many artists come with dope songs and disappear into the ether only to show up decades later on VH1 \u201cOne Hit Wonder\u201d shows because they had nothing else to really offer.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell just how talented (or not) Jidenna was. One good song does not a dope artist make. But I watched interviews and he was not only well spoken (he speaks so well) and sophisticated in thought, he could actually spit. And his backstory is interesting as hell. He\u2019s pretty much like most of us extraordinary negroes out here.\n\nAgain, that was 2015. Like most people borne of the internet age, unless you\u2019re frequenting my eardrums, I will likely forget you exist. Which brings us to this past Tuesday when I decided to peruse Apple Music to find Future\u2019s new album, scrolled and saw that Jidenna released his debut album, The Chief. Did I care? Not really, but shit, I\u2019m in the car and have another 7 hours to drive, #minuswell give it some run.\n\nWell shut my mouth wide open, Jidenna\u2019s album was a revelation and a total surprise. After running through it a few times, I decided that people needed to not only know his album dropped, but needed to listen to it. I'm still undecided on how good it is though I enjoy it, but its definitely worth a listen. So here are 9 reasons why you need to check out The Chief.\n\n2. Jidenna is an actual artist who, according to the liner notes, is involved in the production just as much as the writing. Piggybacking on the first bullet, this isn\u2019t just a rap album, it\u2019s a piece of art. He\u2019s rapping and singing, and does both very well. Obviously, his association with Janelle Monae and the Wondaland Arts Society means that he\u2019s not just a typical artist, but I was surprised at the depth because I only really knew \u201cClassic Man\u201d and really didn\u2019t like \u201cLong Live The Chief\u201d at all, which is on this album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. He\u2019s socially conscious while still being very much a nigga. He\u2019s basically all of us who frequent websites like Very Smart Brothas, who give a shit while being able to wax poetic about wings versus flats, grits, and the merits of Hennessy.\n\n4. The song \u201cTrampoline\u201d is basically \u201cI Am Not My Hair\u201d 2017, except written from the male perspective. Sure a woman may like to bounce her ass up and down like a trampoline (really, who doesn\u2019t?), but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a tramp; she could be a wife, mother, doctor, etc. Effectively, everybody needs to unwind to trap music on occasion. That is of course, unless you can bounce it up and down like a trampoline to Andra Day, which I\u2019m pretty sure is not a thing.\n\nHe does get a little elitist with this \u201cwhat we got degrees for unless we travel overseas for?\u201d which feeds right into the whole bougie negro \u201cmust have passport\u201d mantra, but you know, different strokes for different folks. I feel like this song sounds like it has popular potential but ignant niggas don\u2019t like hearing about passports, wedding rings, and reverends in the midst of drug talk. It reminds me a bit of Janelle Monae\u2019s \u201cYoga,\u201d a song that sounded like it would kill the club except nobody wants to hear a song about yoga at 2am while Ciroc is being poured down their throat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. This may sound blasphemous, but Jidenna\u2019s singing voice is LIGHTLY reminiscent of Sam Cooke. I\u2019m NOT SAYING HE SOUNDS LIKE SAME COOKE. I\u2019m just saying on songs like \u201cBambi,\u201d where he\u2019s singing, he kind of sounds like Sam Cooke and shit. Look, don\u2019t be coming at me on some \u201cP said this nigga Jidenna sounds like Sam Cooke.\u201d I did not. I\u2019m just saying I thought of Sam Cooke when he was singing about lions and shit. And no, \u201cBambi\u201d is not about the Blackest Disney character of all time. Yes, Bambi\u2019s shit was more Black than Simba. Real shit, Disney\u2019s Bambi is really the 1942, animated version of Save The Last Dance starring Julia Stiles if she were a Black boy. I hear you looking at me right now, but trust me, it will make sense eventually. Thank me later.\n\nThat took such a left turn.\n\n6. \u201cChief Don\u2019t Run\u201d is a dope an intro song as you\u2019re going to get. No, it\u2019s not \u201cNo Limit Soldiers\u201d or \u201cWhat Up, Gangsta,\u201d but its triumphant and has the right open up your album feel. You will probably like this song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cWhite N****s\u201d is probably the most brilliant song I\u2019ve heard in years. Premise? Jidenna turns the tables on white folks with some, \u201chey white folks, welcome to being Black\u2026here\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d Also, there\u2019s nothing more hilarious than singing \u201cwhite niggaaaaaaaaaaaaaas\u201d over and over again. The way he says \u201cwhite bitchesssssssssssss\u201d on this song also is very telling. It has emotion behind it. Trust me, I\u2019m a blogger.\n\n8. \u201cWhite N****s\u201d again. Look, if you want to know how smart and creative an artist is, you have to see how they flip old tropes and make them fresh. He managed to do that on this song. We always talk about what life would look like if white people had to face what we do. But we usually do it by putting them in the hood. He keeps white folks in the \u2018burbs and attacks their red wine, golf clubs, dogs, and lacrosse.\n\nThis song is basically the song version of Jack Briggance's (Matthew McConaughey) closing arguments in A Time To Kill where Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) tells him to be white and shit so he goes in there and white people\u2019s it up by having the jury picture a heinous rape happening to a little girl\u2026then Sixth Sensing that shit by telling the jury to imagine that she\u2019s white and the whole jury is like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Not a white child!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLe sigh. I get mad thinking about that all over again.\n\n9. Again, I\u2019m not even sure how good I think the album is yet, but I know I\u2019m impressed and surprised by his depth and how diverse it is in thought and execution. That alone is worth at least a listen.

Master of None\u2019s Lena Waithe became the first African-American woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing, Donald Glover became the first African American to win for comedy-series directing, and Sterling K. Brown became the first black actor since 1998 to win the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Emmy, for his role as Randall Pearson on NBC\u2019s This Is Us.\n\n\n\nWaithe, whose autobiographical series The Chi was picked up by Showtime, won the award for her writing on Master of None\u2019s \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode, in which her character finally comes out to her family.\n\nDuring Waithe\u2019s acceptance speech, she spoke about LGBTQIA issues and urged viewers to \u201cgo out there and conquer the world. It would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nDecked out in an eggplant-colored tuxedo, Glover continued to make history as he took home the award for directing in a comedy series, for his \u201cB.A.N.\u201d episode of Atlanta, but he also won the comedy-lead-actor Emmy for his role on the series as well. During his speech, he joked about Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most-oppressed list,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the reason I\u2019m up here.\u201d\n\nOutside of comedy, Brown, whose popular series This Is Us heads back to TV later in September, thanked his cast as he accepted his award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wanna thank my cast. Milo, Mandy, Justin, Chrissy, you are the best white TV family that a brother has ever had, better than the white folks who raised Webster,\u201d Brown said before he was cut off by music.\n\n\u201cYou can play, you can play. Nobody got that loud music. Our writers, I love you. You are our life\u2019s blood. Our producers and directors, I love you,\u201d Brown added.\n\nSocial media was furious that Brown didn\u2019t get enough time to shine onstage:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would have been a great speech on air was finished backstage as Brown thanked his family, writers and friends.\n\nI wanted to thank our writers. A show doesn\u2019t get seven acting nominations without some impeccable, beautiful, thoughtful writing. You guys are our life\u2019s blood, so I want to thank you so much. To our producers and directors, in particular, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, and the crazy cool Ken Olin. I thank you for your guidance and friendship. And I wanted to thank Dan Fogelman\u2014he is the Hebrew hammer with which our house was built. He makes me laugh and cry in equal parts and keeps me coming back for more, and in his own little small special way. He\u2019s not trying to make America great again, he\u2019s trying to make it the best that it\u2019s ever been and I love him for taking me on this journey.\n\nI wanted to thank my manager. You\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and it feels like we\u2019re just getting started. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next. And to my wife\u2014I didn\u2019t get to thank my wife\u2014you make my life worth living and you gave me two of the most beautiful things that God has ever put on this planet.

Darth Cheeto is currently the President of the United States. Which we're reminded of each time we turn on the news or log onto the internet and see that he seems to be intent on using his presidential authority to prove that the rapey vat of curdled cheese whiz he calls a soul is truly bottomless. But he is President because we named him President. He did not actually win. At least not by any working and relevant understanding of what winning means. Despite Hillary Clinton running the most uninspired and uninspiring political campaign since Stannis Baratheon \u2014 and despite Russia, and despite Comey, and despite the Bernie Bros \u2014 she still won the popular vote by millions. Trump's victory was essentially a spades game he only won because his opponent reneged. And he was talking across the table. And he put a crease in the big joker. And he took advantage of niggas' drunkenness to add 50 points to his score when no one was looking.\n\nThe paradox of Trump \u2014 the \"winner\" who still has yet to actually win anything by himself \u2014 came to mind today as it was revealed that sentient Chernobyl-area test tube Donald Trump Jr definitely knew Russia planned to interfere with the election.

Does it bother him the way a pesky mosquito on a stoop bothers people? Or is he perpetually bothered? Did the election make him go full Joe Budden?\n\nPersonally, I think it's somewhere in-between.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

What?! This is the true story of Margot Lee Shetterly. She is the black woman who helped bring Hidden Figures to life.\n\nHidden Figures is the amazing but previously untold story of three black female mathematicians\u2014Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan; their contributions to NASA; and pretty much their role in helping shape America's history in space exploration.\n\nThis story is not only a surefire box-office smash but also a book that was written as the movie was being produced. Shetterly is now a New York Times best-selling author, and Hidden Figures is also the No. 1 young readers book. Shetterly wondered, as we all did, how does that happen on your first book? She and I chatted on the phone, mostly gushing over her seemingly overnight success. \"It\u2019s a lightning strike \u2026 fairy dust,\" she said.\n\n\"I wrote the book I wanted to read,\" she added. \"I wanted those kinds of women protagonists\u2014strong, smart, successful, and [I wanted] to show the challenges they faced. I wanted it big and American.\"\n\nShetterly also wanted the world to see that black people are as much a part of American history as anyone. \"I didn\u2019t know how badly other people wanted it, not just black women.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what a revelation!\n\nBefore the book was even finished, Hidden Figures producer Donna Gigliotti put it in the hands of Hollywood heavyweights and told Shetterly, \"We're going to make \u2026 a movie out of your book proposal.\" Within three years, both the book and the movie were finished.\n\nAnd now Shetterly has gone from an unknown writer to a best-seller who not only gets to be in the same room as first lady Michelle Obama but also gets to be praised by her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what's next? How do you move up from this height as an author? Shetterly is already working on her next book, which is part of the trilogy that Hidden Figures kicks off. Can we say \u201cYay!\u201d about more black history being revealed?\n\nShetterly is obsessed with midcentury stories and wants to continue telling them. She tells me, \"The new story [I'm working on] is also unseen, but not quite untold. It deals with midcentury. Anything I will ever do in life will not be as consuming and overwhelming as Hidden Figures.\"\n\nShe's modest, which is understandable, because not everyone gets this type of love with a first book, but success can be fleeting. I'm sure, though, that Shetterly will continue to see major success so long as she's writing our stories with such care and honesty. I'm looking forward to her continued success and am just glad I get to help tell her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the interview with Shetterly:\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["im", "knows", "blackgirlmagic", "limits", "figures", "history", "proves", "movie", "wanted", "book", "success", "lee", "black", "shetterlys", "margot", "hidden", "shetterly"], "polarity": 0.09996526107637219, "subjectivity": 0.4270936882047993},

I love Jesus, too; still, the holiday season overlaps with cuffing season, and with all that cold weather and love in the air, you are likely to spend your time either drinking eggnog while laid up with the one you love or sipping something dark and flavorful contemplating why you\u2019re alone on Christmas Eve. Musical artists know this\u2014that is why there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to brown-liquor Christmas songs.\n\nAs I stated before, in order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria:\n\nIt must have a pronounced bass line.\n\nThis bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony.\n\nThe sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for it to qualify as a brown-liquor Christmas song, it must do Nos. 1 to 3 while also commenting upon or utilizing symbols of the holiday season. This can be done by a) turning a traditional Christmas song into a brown-liquor song (see: the Temptations\u2019 \u201cSilent Night\u201d); b) taking a symbol of Christmas and using it in playful and libidinous ways (see: Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d); or c) using Christmas as a setting to lament the one who got away (see: Luther\u2019s \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas\u201d).\n\nMany Christmas songs qualify, but below, I present to you the 10 best brown-liquor Christmas songs of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\u201d by Kenny Burrell\n\nThis is a soulful and jazzy cover of the Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers classic. It\u2019s perfect background music for when you have friends over and you\u2019re mixing up amaretto sours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d by John Coltrane\n\nI\u2019m a jazz snob. I don\u2019t do the cheap, elevator-music-adjacent Kenny G bastardization of the black-American art form. If it doesn\u2019t push the boundaries of melody, then you can miss me with your whitewashed, sweet-white-wine shenanigans. \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d by \u2019Trane is a 13-minute encounter with the divine. It is a masterpiece and perfect with a hot buttered bourbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSanta Claus Wants Some Loving,\u201d by Albert King\n\nEven Santa has needs. This raunchy jawn is your crazy uncle\u2019s second-favorite Christmas song. He drinks Jim Beam out the bottle while he listens to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d by Luther Vandross\n\nLuther\u2019s voice was one of a kind. \u201cIntimate,\u201d \u201csultry\u201d and \u201cvelvety\u201d don\u2019t do it justice, and his voice is on full display as he sings about how the holiday is a source of pain because his lover is not with him. Sip this with Crown Royal and ginger ale. Be sure you don\u2019t get tears in the glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cA Child Is Born,\u201d by Oscar Peterson\n\nThis is a quiet, mournful jazz standard written by composer Alec Wilder and trumpeter Thad Jones. On this cover, Peterson improvises on the melody, filling out the sonic landscape of the song in ways that make it both soulful and melancholic. Watch the snowfall as you listen to this and drink a Swedish glogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas,\u201d by Charles Brown\n\nThis is the official Christmas song of juke joints and liquor houses everywhere. Charles Brown\u2019s vocalizations put one in the mood to sip something brown and aged while yearning for the one who got away. Pair this with a Macallan 18-year, straight, no chaser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d by the Temptations\n\nThe Temptations\u2019 rendition of this Christmas classic is a soulful blend of the sacred and the secular. Listening to Glenn Leonard makes me do the ugly church face ubiquitous in black houses of worship. This is your spiked-apple-cider song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cLet It Snow,\u201d by Boyz II Men\n\nChristmas is in winter, and winter is cuffing season. I contend that \u201cLet It Snow\u201d is the definitive sexy Christmas song. \u201cThe market is full of widely recognized artists singing the usual classics,\u201d says Elon Dancy, professor of education and associate dean for community engagement and academic inclusion at the University of Oklahoma. He is a scholar world-renowned for his research into black men in higher education but is also an underappreciated cultural critic. He continues, \u201cHowever, one of the special contributions of Christmas Interpretations is that the majority of the album is original Christmas music \u2026 it is musical velvet.\u201d Keep warm as this plays by sipping a spiked hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cBack Door Santa,\u201d by Clarence Carter\n\nOn this track, Carter is petty, trifling and brilliant. That\u2019s why this is your crazy uncle\u2019s favorite Christmas song. He gets fancy, says, \u201cWhat you young bucks know \u2019bout dis right cha,\u201d and drinks Courvoisier out of a snifter as he grooves to this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cThis Christmas,\u201d by Donny Hathaway\n\nMuch has been said about this track, so I will just stress to you how strongly I feel that this is the official Christmas song of black folks everywhere. This joint is suitable for every occasion and pairs with any drink.

If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["roll", "queer", "gospel", "n", "little", "sister", "rosetta", "rock", "black", "recorded", "woman", "invented", "tharpe", "music"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

Many of us are just now learning their names: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughn.\n\nSo much of our history has been omitted from the curricula of many schools. That's a huge chunk of the foundation of racism that our country is built on. It's the reason that the three women who are highlighted in Hidden Figures, as well as the many black women who worked right alongside them and many others, have been ignored by history. It's the reason that today, some 54 years later, we still have to proclaim that black lives matter when we see evidence right in front of our eyes that says they don't.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn's orbit around Earth in 1962 was called one of the most important flights in U.S. history, and it no doubt is. NASA even says that because of that mission, Glenn \"became a national hero and a symbol of American ambition.\" And yet there was no mention of the numbers that made the mission successful, or that the only numbers Glenn trusted were Johnson's.\n\nAt a press conference for Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson, who plays Johnson, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing a person who\u2019s real, there\u2019s a responsibility to get it right. As soon as I signed on, I asked if she was still alive. I had to meet her immediately.\u201d Johnson and her family were delighted not only to meet the superstar but also to have her play the beloved matriarch, who is now 98 years old.\n\nAnd while Henson felt that she was in the presence of a queen-and-superhero hybrid, it was Johnson's humility that floored her. Johnson told Henson that it's just the way things were and she just wanted to do her job and do it well. Henson was blown away, as we will be with her performance. Taraji P. Henson becomes Katherine Johnson\u2014embodying struggle and flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer, who portrays Vaughn, was the first to sign on to the hefty project, and she just knew she needed to be a part of it. So of course the director, Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Melfi, locked the Oscar-winning actress in. At the Hidden Figures press conference, of her portrayal of Vaughn, she said, \"There\u2019s enough negative images of black women out there. I didn\u2019t want to portray her in some stereotype. I wanted to make sure her integrity was preserved.\u201d\n\nThese heroes' images are not only preserved but reinvigorated. These women will help future generations defy the world's limitations. Margot Shetterly, the author of the book Hidden Figures, which was being produced the same time as the movie, says that her mission was to expand the idea of what black women were capable of. \"They went to work and brought their A game. They did our country and women a great service. They are the American dream,\" Shetterly says.\n\nThis is a history lesson we all deserve. Knowing that black women were the backbone of one of the biggest space missions in America is knowing that we can be anything. It's knowing that #BlackGirlMagic is an actual trait in our DNA that allows us to excel gracefully. It's knowing that even when we're \"hidden figures,\" we're still there, making our mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the trailer:", "keywords": ["legacy", "women", "upholds", "changed", "knowing", "right", "world", "history", "extraordinary", "mission", "black", "henson", "figures", "johnson", "hidden"], "polarity": 0.14494047619047615, "subjectivity": 0.49054232804232795},

It begins with acknowledgment that black people play a pivotal role in shaping various sectors of popular culture in the U.S. In its findings, \u201c73 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 67 percent of Hispanics believe that African Americans influence mainstream culture.\u201d Congratulations to all who can clock the obvious without complication.\n\n\n\nNow, as the report shifts to its specific focus, Nielsen notes, \u201cSeveral programs with a predominantly black cast or a main storyline focusing on a black character are drawing substantial non-black viewership.\u201d\n\nExamining 2016-2017 television, the study finds:\n\nWith 89 percent nonblack viewership, This Is Us, NBC\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated ensemble dramedy, includes Sterling K. Brown as a black businessman raised by white parents and tackles topics such as drug addiction, racism, homosexuality, alcoholism, adoption, obesity and cancer.\n\nABC\u2019s hit sitcom Black-ish follows a father and husband (Anthony Anderson) who\u2019s trying to create a sense of black cultural identity for his affluent family of four and has 79 percent nonblack viewership. Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.\n\nThree-fourths of the viewers are nonblack for Secrets and Lies, the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.\n\nABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal-defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show\u2019s viewership is nonblack.\n\nSixty-eight percent of viewership is nonblack for ABC\u2019s Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes \u201cShondaLand\u201d thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.\n\nWith 63 percent nonblack viewers, Fox\u2019s Pitch is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.\n\nInsecure is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae\u2019s popular web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, viewership is 61 percent nonblack.\n\nHalf of viewership for the newcomer Atlanta is nonblack. The show, a Golden Globe-winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the tone of this study, one is supposed to find this encouraging.\n\n\n\nIndeed, of its findings, Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen, says:\n\n\n\nMuch of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen\u2019s data on television programming show something different. Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespectfully, presenting data that reveals that black-led television shows have crossover appeal is akin to other earth-shattering news like Popeyes biscuits taste like heaven in your mouth, there\u2019s nothing like being debt-free and dick too bomb.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely revealing about this information. The same goes for the study\u2019s noting that shows with a majority-black audience, like Empire, can manage to still \u201cpropel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success.\u201d\n\nYes, Taraji P. Henson is a Golden Globe-winning, Emmy-nominated actress thanks to her role as Cookie Lyon on Empire, but you know who long ago met this feat? Jack\u00e9e Harry, who remains the first and only black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She won for her role as the original Instagram model Sandra Clark on 227. 227 was a show about working-class Negroes in Washington, D.C., before the white folks took over and put bike lanes on Georgia Avenue near Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo am I supposed to be thrilled about this news that could easily have been packaged with the hashtags of #TBT or #FBF? Sorry, Nielsen, but I do decline. To be fair, Nielsen does note that television shows such as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son and The Cosby Show had already proved that our shows can be watched by all. Even so, Nielsen offers the addendum: \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t much \u2019bout al-ge-bra, but I do know if a few black shows can claim crossover appeal, an increased volume ought to yield a similar result. Us black folks are pretty diverse, don\u2019t ya know? I mean, clearly America had Negro fatigue, as evidenced by that new man in the White House, but if The Cosby Show and A Different World could thrive as trifling Ronald Reagan hollered about welfare queens and crack, Issa Rae, Donald Glover, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis can maintain success under Minute Maid Mao\u2019s mismanaged terrorist reign.\n\nSo, now that we know that the truth of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s is true in the 2010s, what will networks do about it? Will they continue to be more inclusive in their background? They could. After all, it would be nice to see more visibility in terms of class, gender and sexual orientation. We may be seeing more of us on television, but it\u2019s still not all of us. Maybe networks will finally embrace a stubborn reality and keep a great thing going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr they could follow their previous pattern of seeing our value and casting it aside anyway. In some respects, you already see that. Go ask Tamron Hall. Go ask anyone black who tried to launch a successful television show in the late 1990s or 2000s.\n\n\n\nI want to be hopeful because hope is all we have. However, while others celebrated this survey, I found it largely inconsequential. Those majority-white executives have always known that black people and black culture can reach all. It is a debate that has long been settled.\n\n\n\nAgain, the question is not can we be appreciated by all, but when will our value finally be acknowledged, accepted and, mostly, continuously invested in? Then we can ask about a proper Girlfriends series finale or full-out reunion because Joan and Toni not reuniting before the conclusion was some bullshit. Consider that a part of the reparations backstage, white people.\n\n", "keywords": ["shows", "television", "golden", "series", "tv", "appeal", "viewership", "crossover", "nonblack", "sidepiece", "white", "black", "know", "treatment", "blackled", "nielsen"], "polarity": 0.1290927822177822, "subjectivity": 0.48281041874791863},

Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, the movie's three stars, were among the notable women on the panel, as well as the author of the book on which the movie is based, Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nHidden Figures tells the incredible story of three brilliant African-American women\u2014Katherine Johnson (Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e)\u2014who worked at NASA and were the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The trio made history not only as women but as African-American women.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the audience heard a bit about the lives and stories behind each character, especially concerning Katherine Johnson, who is celebrated in the film as the main source of intelligence behind one of the greatest operations in NASA history.\n\nHenson described Johnson as a courageous woman living in a time in history when accomplishments like hers were unheard of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're talking about being the first woman in a room of all white men at a time where that was not popular. The courage to even walk in that room with your head held high,\" she said. \"I don't think many people could do that. Just the fear of 'What are they going to think of me?' or 'Will I make it?' The courage just to walk in that room speaks to her fearlessness, speaks to her tenacity, speaks to her brilliance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you couldn't take her mind from her. You could call her all kinds of names and belittle her efforts, but she had a brilliant mind that God gave her. And she walked in that. She did not complain,\" Henson added.\n\nThe idea of Johnson not complaining was something that Henson emphasized and acknowledged that she learned and took away from in playing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I use that in my life,\" she said. \"I don't complain about Hollywood. I don't say that they don't do this for black women and that and the third; I just keep working because one day you look up and you're a Golden Globe winner, you're Academy Award-nominated, but I couldn't get there by complaining.\"\n\nDorothy Vaughan, played by Spencer, was Johnson's supervisor, and Mary Jackson, played by Mon\u00e1e, was an engineer who also worked at the agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen speaking of these three historic and inspiring women, Michelle Obama underlined the great dedication each had to their field, as well as their ability to maintain their poise during the racism and sexism that they faced at the time.\n\n\"Now, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues,\" the first lady pointed out. \"And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black and also because they were women. \u2026 But they didn't listen to those doubters, you understand? They did not listen to the haters.\"\n\nThe event was held in front of a small audience, much of it high school and middle school students. And so, fittingly, one of the main themes that seemed to be seen throughout the presentation was the importance of hard work and how far it can get individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What also matters is how hard you're willing to work,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Because none of this is easy, and it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nWhen discussing hard work, the first lady referenced her own husband, President Barack Obama, and his diligent work ethic and serious commitment to his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look at this eight years,\" she said. \"We were supposed to be 'hidden.'

Do you call yourself a true Beyonc\u00e9 stan? Do you think you know the entire trajectory of the megastar from her being a child of destiny to being Queen of the Beyhive, including the details of her pre-Lemonade cornrow era, the exact shade of her shimmering stage tights and the length of her longest lace front?\n\nIf you are that fan, then perhaps you\u2019ll understand the value of this rare opportunity: Currently up for auction is a collection of circa-1992 videotapes documenting the star\u2019s rise\u2014with appearances from then-bandmates Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett, of course.\n\nTouting two-and-a-half hours of raw, unedited, previously unreleased footage, the collection of 19 Betacam(!) tapes is being auctioned off by English appraisal and auction house Ted Owen & Co at the bargain base price of 750,000 pounds\u2014that\u2019s $1,030,517 U.S.\u2014though the house has estimated the value of these rare gems between 1.5 million and 3 million pounds. And just so you know how much Beyonc\u00e9 a million and change will get you, the auction\u2019s description is as follows:\n\nThe collection is now comprised of 19 videotapes (previously 11) that contain the footage from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two professionally produced music video productions. These videos were never officially released and the footage in the collection used to create them is nearly three hours in length. Included are Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s rehearsals, performances and outtakes that were shot before, during and after an onstage performance with her group Girl\u2019s Tyme at the BMI New Music showcase at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco on Aug. 26, 1992. Also included are scenes shot at the Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, Calif., during the time Beyonc\u00e9 was there to record her first professionally produced and engineered recordings. There is also footage from a third location\u2014a shopping mall\u2014where Beyonc\u00e9 is acting for the camera beside her longtime friend and Destiny\u2019s Child member / Grammy Award Winner LaTavia Roberson. In addition, the collection includes the edited master tapes and work-in-progress tapes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two music video productions. The collection has been locked in storage for more than 20 years and has only been seen by a select few people since being recorded.\n\nIf you\u2019re the Sultan of Brunei-level of Beyonc\u00e9 fan who feels they absolutely must have these pre-Auto-Tune performances in their life, our guess is that you can also afford to track down a Betacam player before the auction ends on March 13.

Vulture writer John Kennedy did the Lord\u2019s work and ranked Jay-Z\u2019s songs from worst to best.\n\nOf course, most people scrolled right to the bottom\u2014the longest scroll ever; it was like a Ta-Nehisi Coates-article scroll\u2014to see what was ranked as Jay\u2019s best. The answer?\n\nFind out, after these messages!\n\nJust kidding.\n\n\u201cHard Knock Life\u201d was ranked as his best song. While I can see some folks arguing about this, I tend to agree. The piece basically makes the case that it\u2019s the song that changed Jay\u2019s career, and I agree. Also, the song itself is one of his most innovative and dope records. It would be one thing if, I don\u2019t know, \u201cLucky Me\u201d were listed as numero uno. \u201cHard Knock Life\u201d changed everything for Jay and sent him on the road to that billi he\u2019s headed toward. My personal favorite \u201cCan I Live?\u201d came in at No. 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t even pretend that I read through each entry, and the article seemed to generally follow along the way you\u2019d expect, with many songs from Kingdom Come, Magna Carta ... Holy Grail and Blueprint 2, plus the R. Kelly albums, toward the end. Look, it doesn\u2019t really matter what song came in No. 176 (\u201cOh My God\u201d) or even No. 254 (\u201cStranded [Haiti Mon Amour]\u201d). Ranking those songs was a labor of love, I assure you, and only because he began the undertaking did Kennedy even have to listen to them.\n\nNope, the only songs that really mattered are Nos. 1, 2-10 and the very last fucking song, 274. And what was ranked as Jay\u2019s worst song?\n\n\u201cAnything\u201d from the Kingdom Come album. Not \u201cAnything,\u201d the b0nus cut on Vol. 3, or from Beanie Sigel\u2019s The Truth album. THAT \u201cAnything\u201d was straight fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmmm. Several songs from Kingdom Come could make this slot. In fact, if EYE had to pick what I think is the worst Jay song, it would be the song that follows \u201cAnything\u201d on KC, \u201cHollywood,\u201d one of his many horrendous joint songs with Queen Beyonc\u00e9. On this list, \u201cHollywood\u201d in all its putrescence is ranked at No. 263. I think we call that \u201cmercy\u201d in the religious community.\n\nHow bad is \u201cHollywood\u201d? It\u2019s so bad, I couldn\u2019t find a YouTube video of the song. It\u2019s so bad that when I pulled it up on Tidal, I immediately got mad that I pay $9.99 a month to listen to this song. This song is so bad that even Beyonc\u00e9 couldn\u2019t save it. Even Jay\u2019s flow on the song is basura. This song is bad on an album full of bad songs. Even now, I went back and listened to \u201cAnything\u201d and almost decided that \u201cAnything\u201d IS the worst, but nope, I have visceral reactions to \u201cHollywood,\u201d mostly because why, Jay, did you make this song? Bey is the only good thing about this super-contrived-ass song.\n\nIt\u2019s as if Jay said, \u201cI need a song that sounds like a good radio song; somebody queue some trash up,\u201d and Young Guru said, \u201cSay no more.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m being harsh, but to me, it\u2019s that bad. You know, I\u2019m surprised nobody has pointed out that all of their best collaborations happened on Beyonc\u00e9 albums. \u201cUpgrade You,\u201d \u201cDrunk in Love,\u201d \u201cCrazy in Love,\u201d etc. Meanwhile, Jay has \u201cHollywood,\u201d \u201cBonnie and Clyde \u201903\u201d and \u201cLift Off,\u201d though the latter was on the Watch the Throne album. Point is, Bey kept the best collabos for herself. She smart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you know how sometimes people say things like, \u201cEven though it\u2019s the worst, that doesn\u2019t make something bad\u201d? Yeah, that doesn\u2019t apply here. \u201cAnything\u201d is legit a terrible song. When your favorite artists are prolific and have a tremendous output, not everything is going to be good, but bad is bad, man. Shit. And \u201cAnything\u201d is amazingly bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anybody has ever asked Jay about that song (probably not), but I know I\u2019ve often wondered what goes on in the head of these artists when they hear certain songs and decide, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it right there.\u201d Granted, perhaps there are other factors at work and there\u2019s a sound he was going for. I\u2019ve often felt that way about \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d on The Black Album.\n\nThe Black Album is easily one of Jay\u2019s best albums. On my personal list, it\u2019s No. 3 after Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint and, now, right before 4:44. But \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d always felt like an anomaly to me. The beat, produced by one of my all-time favorites, DJ Quik, felt like a throwaway. Even the song itself seemed ... ungood. It made No. 218 on the Vulture list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the good thing about an artist of Jay\u2019s caliber is that the good faaaaaar outweighs the bad. And there\u2019s so much good. The good is full of so many highs and cultural landmarks that, short of Jay releasing an album full of records that all sound like \u201cHollywood\u201d or \u201cAnything\u201d or \u201cSuper Ugly\u201d (which, to its credit, had the SUPER dope \u201cBad Intentions\u201d beat from Dr. Dre and Knoc-Turn\u2019Al), he\u2019ll be all right.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019ve been around for a solid 20-plus years, constantly putting in work, the bottom of that list tends to be forgotten out of respect. And ultimately, Jay probably laughs about such things as he walks into the bank and they roll out the red carpet and pour him glasses of D\u2019Uss\u00e9 while he says, \u201cAm I still rich?\u201d and the bankers say, \u201cYes, Jay, sir, you are still rich.\u201d\n\nBut just know that if anybody you know ever tells you that a) Kingdom Come is their favorite Jay album and b) \u201cAnything\u201d (or \u201cHollywood\u201d) is their favorite song, they are not to be trusted.", "keywords": ["jay", "know", "jays", "good", "song", "really", "hollywood", "songs", "album", "bad", "kingdom", "worst", "jayzs", "come"], "polarity": 0.05103646353646356, "subjectivity": 0.5874589673147363},

Henson and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2014had been sold. This comes as no surprise: The story of these brilliant African-American female \u201chuman computers\u201d who were instrumental in calculating the math necessary to propel rockets into space is fascinating. The only surprise is that this story has not been told before.\n\nNovelist Toni Morrison says, \u201cIf there\u2019s a book that you want to read but it hasn\u2019t been written yet, then you must write it.\u201d Enter Shetterly, who grew up in Hampton, Va., the site where this mathematical research was done\u2014and who also knew first-hand many of the black women who had been employed to do these mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that black women had been recruited to work as mathematicians at the NASA installation in the South during the days of segregation defies our expectations and challenges much of what we think we know about American history,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nSimply put, this book is the story she needed to write.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I knew so many African Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that\u2019s just what black folks did,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was her normal. There was Mrs. Land, a NASA mathematician who taught Sunday school every Sunday morning. There was Katherine Johnson, who worked on computing the trajectory for John Glenn\u2019s space flight. There was Dorothy Vaughan, who wrote the textbook on algebraic methods for the mechanical calculating machines used throughout the department.\n\nAnd these women are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI can put names to almost 50 black women who worked as computers, mathematicians, engineers or scientists at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory from 1943 through 1980, and my intuition is that 20 more names can be shaken loose from the archives with more research,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Shetterly is careful to note that what seemed normal to her did not come easily to this previous generation. Her father, growing up during segregation, had a passion for engineering but was told to become a physical education teacher instead.\n\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d writes Shetterly, \u201ccollege-educated African Americans with book smarts and common sense put their chips on teaching jobs or sought work at the post office.\u201d\n\nShetterly\u2019s father\u2019s love of engineering\u2014\u201che built his first rocket in junior high metal shop class\u201d\u2014would not let him give up his dream. Still, it was not easy: \u201cAs late as 1970, just 1 percent of all American engineers were black\u2014a number that doubled to a whopping 2 percent by 1984,\u201d writes Shetterly. \u201cStill, the federal government was the most reliable employer of African Americans in the sciences and technology: In 1984, 8.4 percent of NASA\u2019s engineers were black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden Figures shines a much-needed light on the contributions of black women in science and technology that have been vastly overlooked. In prose that is engaging and compelling, Shetterly refutes the commonly held stereotype that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields are the province of men, specifically white men. Black women have been doing this work for ages. Before desktop computers, black women were the computing machines, using their vast intelligence to determine the orbital trajectories of space flight and accomplish other leading discoveries in aerodynamics and engineering.\n\n\u201cEven as a professional in an integrated world, I have been the only black woman in enough drawing rooms and boardrooms to have an inkling of the chutzpah it took for an African-American woman in a segregated southern workplace to tell her bosses she was sure her calculations would put a man on the Moon,\u201d Shetterly writes.\n\nIt is this empathy with her subjects\u2014her ability to put herself in their shoes\u2014that brings the narrative to life. Steeped in history and thorough research, Shetterly also crafts richly drawn portrayals of these black women who were mathematicians, engineers and scientists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn vivid, specific detail, Shetterly paints the personal and professional lives of these black women who were vital to America\u2019s scientific advancement. We see their brilliance in their work; we see the ever-present institutional racism; we see the racist microaggressions from white colleagues; we see the inevitable \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on drinking fountains and bathrooms in their workplace Langley. And yet these women were responsible for some of the greatest scientific advancements of the age.\n\nThis is a book that should be required reading in schools\u2014both as a history of science and technology and an inspiration for young black women to succeed in STEM fields. This is history that needs to be told; this is history that is still an ever-present reality for women of color working in STEM fields.\n\nBy celebrating these black female \u201chuman computers,\u201d we give credit to the work of black women that has, like the achievements of black women in so many other fields, historically been ignored. In Shetterly\u2019s clear, vibrant prose, we have a compelling, thoroughly researched narrative that is in a class of its own.

In fact, I\u2019ve spent more time being confounded by their inability to disappear into the hip-hop ether than I have enjoying their trapcoctions. Also, the fact that these are some \u201ctrappers\u201d from Gwinnett County \u2013 aka \"the North, that way\" aka where you move to in Atlanta when you\u2019ve made it and need to stay away from family \u2013 always rubbed me the wrong way. I realize that being \u201creal\u201d in rap is a long overrated requirement, however, sometimes knowing too much can ruin a thing.\n\nThough MC Breed was wrong when he proclaimed that there was no future in frontin, I can openly admit to enjoying several songs created by not one migo, but all three of the Migos. Moving on, because of them, in 2013, I said the word \u201cVersace\u201d at least 2,000 more times than I otherwise would have. The hook to \u201cFight Night\u201d is WAAAAAAY more fun to recite in any venue than you\u2019d believe. And while I\u2019m not both \u201cHandsome AND Wealthy\u201d, one out of two ain\u2019t bad. I guess the Migos ain\u2019t so bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings us to the Golden Globes from a few weeks back, when Donald Glover, in his infinite wisdom, made this statement while receiving one of his two awards:\n\n\u201cI really wanna thank the Migos, not for being in the show, but for making \u2018Bad and Boujee,\u2019\u201d Glover said. \u201cLike that\u2019s the best song ever.\u201d\n\nWhich was hilarious for a few reasons: 1) this statement likely helped drive \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d to the number one spot on Billboard the next week, and 2) they panned to Stevie Wonder in the audience who looked confused as if to say, \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhem.\n\nThing is, I might agree with Donald Glover. Hyperbole? Yes. But listen, that song is infectious. Here are 10 reasons why Donald Glover just might be right.\n\n1. I came to know \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d the same way MOST of us did: I kept hearing mothefuckers referencing rain drops and drop tops and had NO clue what the hell they were talking about. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and made me do the googles was some meme about what some fellow was leaving in 2016 and taking into 2017, and he was bringing \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d. Once I googled and saw it referenced a Migos song, my first inclination was to be like, \u201coh that makes sense, what\u2019s on NPR?\u201d but I listenededededed to the song for what was the first of maybe a solid, I don\u2019t know, 1,000, over the past few weeks. No lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoint is, \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d is the gateway to that song and whether they knew it or not, it\u2019s motherfucking brilliant because it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SONG AND MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER but holy shit. You\u2019ve heard no shortage of people you know and respect say \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d in the past few weeks sending you to the breaking point where you have to google it and then life.changes. I may or may not have said this in a meeting at work recently. My boss may or may not have said, \u201cI keep hearing this, what is that?\u201d Only one of the preceding sentences is false.\n\n2. The beat isn\u2019t anywhere close to being one of Metro Boomin\u2019s best beats. However, something about that slow, plodding beat is sympatico with asses clapping on stripper poles, rolling down the street smokin' indo sippin' on gin and juice , sweeping, mixing up cake batter, stapling, doing a chemistry experiment, etc. It's multi-purpose. If you walked into your progressive church and heard the beat playing as the ushers sat you down, would you be surprised? Probably not.\n\n3. Much like Waka Flocka Flame's \"Round of Applause,\" \"Bad and Boujee\" is fully appreciable by watching an ENTIRE room full of educated professionals say, \u201cmy bitch is bad and boujee, cookin\u2019 up dope with an uzi\u2026\u201d, most of whom have never seen an uzi in their entire lives and don\u2019t even realize that the very gun STOPPED BEING MANUFACTURED ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Let\u2019s talk about uzis since the Migos talk about uzis, a lot. While I\u2019d like to think that is just drug dealers talking about their hardware, I\u2019d put all of my money on the fact that because \u201cuzi\u201d rhymes with \u201cboujee\u201d it\u2019s the firearm of choice for our friendly neighborhood Subway-restaurant trappers from Lawrenceville, at least on this song. However, again, brilliant. It\u2019s got me talking about uzis again and that\u2019s almost always a good thing.\n\n5. Offset bodies both the hook and his verse. And until this song, I absolutely could not tell Offset from Takeoff, two niggas with some of the most non-awesome rap names in a long time, which is saying something because I just mentioned Waka Flocka Flame. Like, you cannot see yourself buying an album from a nigga named Offset. Or Takeoff for that matter. Quavo has the best name and is the clear standout of Migos, except on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d where, again, Offset goes for broke and puts his foot all up in this song.\n\n6. \u201cYeah, that way\u201d has been on my soul for the past three weeks. I say this whenever I can. Seriously. I stood outside Metro one day asking pedestrians if they needed directions JUST so I could say, \u201cYEAH, THAT WAY.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. I\u2019m about to get real meta for a second. There are three members of Migos: Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff. In some odd Black family way, they\u2019re all actual family, like cousins and uncles and nephews or some shit. It\u2019s Black as fuck. However, on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d, only Offset and Quavo are present along with a HORRID verse from Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert (we\u2019ll get to him later). In my head, there was a decision that had to be made where they were determining who wouldn\u2019t make the cut for \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d and they decided to take off\u2026TAKEOFF.\n\nBruh.\n\nThey taked off TAKEOFF off the song. Mind.Blown. I almost wonder if they were sitting around and had a moment of divine inspiration at the realization and Takeoff just stood up and walked out the studio. It\u2019s almost poetic. The lesson here: don\u2019t name yourself Takeoff unless you\u2019re a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert is on this song. He sucks. Tremendously. According to the social medias, he is apparently the hot nigga on the song. I contest that stress. I don\u2019t even hate the Tiny Green Gunna Boy. His song \u201cMoney Longer\u201d is a straight banger. I think he looks odd and even in this video he some how decides to tuck his t-shirt into some extra small sweatpants, which is decidedly unhip-hop. But even though his verse is the worst on the song \u2013 he doesn\u2019t say \u201cthat way\u201d not even once, the lazy tiny bastard \u2013 because the song itself is so awesome, I can live with it. He\u2019s just lucky his name isn\u2019t some shit like TakeOff. But on some EXTRA meta shit, Migos were like, we took off Takeoff, and Offset was dancing around singing about uzis and I\u2019ll bet Quavo said\u2026 \u201cbruh, there\u2019s a rapper named Uzi\u2026let\u2019s get him.\u201d\n\nMind. More blown.\n\n9. Quavo says the word \u201cratatouille\u201d like rat-a-tooly. Let that sink in. He says to call him Quavo Rat-a-tooly. That happened. You and I both know he\u2019s seen the movie Ratatouille because who hasn\u2019t. Yet and still he added in the \u201cl\u201d in what can only be described as an eff you to the French. And it was awesome. I\u2019m here for France, tho. Because lineage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The term \u201cbad and boujee\u201d itself is alliterative perfection. Offset says is in the most serendipitous way possible. They should get a Grammy for best sound recording in 2017. They won\u2019t. But they should. It works. It\u2019s employed. The Migos told me to tell you, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome.\u201d And no, serendipity didn't work up there. But neither does \"rain drops, drop tops\" and they have the number one song in the country.

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

The first song on the album is called \u201cApple of My Eye.\u201d As I listened to this song for the first time, a very familiar voice, one I\u2019ve been listening to since I was 9 years old (I\u2019m currently 38), came booming through the system: that of Raphael Saadiq.\n\nThe man who told me in 1990 that it never rained in Southern California (absolutely not true\u2014it does rain, just not enough) and had me ready to \u201cdance tonight\u201d (every night) in 2000 is still showing up on albums in 2017 by one of the more famous rappers in the game. Still sounding crisp as ever; making music worth listening to.\n\n\n\nIt was at that moment I realized a simple fact: Raphael Saadiq might be the most underappreciated artist in music, but especially R&B. Ever.\n\nEver.\n\nI hear you looking at me; I\u2019m not crazy. Think about it. For real for real. Why do I say the most underappreciated? Simple. When was the last time you had a conversation about great artists and Raphael Saadiq\u2019s name came up? I\u2019ll wait. This despite the fact that he\u2019s not only been around for what feels like my entire life, but has been making music that I\u2019ve listened to during that entire span. Even his Wikipedia page is disrespectful; Ja Rule\u2019s page is more in-depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! dropped in 1988. Nobody really remembers that first album much, but in 1990, when the group came through with the second album, The Revival, we were all paying attention. \u201cFeels Good\u201d still jams, and if you tell me that you love the \u201990s and don\u2019t know the words to \u201cIt Never Rains (in Southern California),\u201d I will call you a lie and a cheat, Joe Jackson, and I don\u2019t want you.\n\nThe group brought us such classics as \u201cAnniversary,\u201d \u201cLay Your Head (on My Pillow),\u201d \u201cNo Loot,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Get Down,\u201d \u201cThinkin\u2019 of You\u201d and \u201cJust Me and You,\u201d and you know that, especially given later successes, Raphael was at least driving 75 percent of the time on that road trip. House of Music? It\u2019s like butter, baby, and hinted, substantially, at where he\u2019d be going, especially with his solo works and D\u2019Angelo. Put a pin in D\u2019Angelo.\n\nDuring this time comes the real solo hammer: 1995\u2019s \u201cAsk of You\u201d from the Higher Learning soundtrack. Bruh. I ain\u2019t saying it\u2019s the most \u201990s song of all time\u2014or the best\u2014but this song made its way onto almost every \u201cYou My Boo\u201d mixtape back when those were actually cassette tapes. It is that dope a song. Not to mention, his harmonica game was on a hundred-thousand trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe years 1999 and 2000 were huge for Raphael and the culture. Along with Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest and Dawn Robinson from En Vogue, Saadiq brought us Lucy Pearl, a group project that included the song \u201cDance Tonight\u201d but was, on its own merits, an album chock-full of dope jams and smooth riddims. I still rock this album\u2014front to back\u2014today. That was \u201999. In 2000 he helped D\u2019Angelo channel his vision for the song \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201c from the Voodoo album, which led to \u201cthe video.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, though, Saadiq was a significant part of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s song \u201cLady\u201d from Brown Sugar.\n\nThus far, we\u2019ve got the three Tony/i/es, Lucy Pearl, D\u2019Angelo and solo recordings, all yielding magnificent results.\n\nBut 2002 is when the rubber hit the road, fam. He released his debut album (a solid 14 years after really hitting the scene) with the ABSOLUTE, INARGUABLY classic album Instant Vintage. From \u201cDoing What I Can\u201d to \u201cSkyy, Can You Feel Me,\u201d the entire album was one big-ass ride though musical perfection. If you have never heard this album, you absolutely should head to your nearest streaming service and listen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\nLet\u2019s skip a little bit, seeing as how Saadiq\u2019s catalog includes production for a plethora of artists from Angie Stone to Erykah Badu to Bobby Valentino. But take a gander\u2014a goose, if you will\u2014to 2016, when Solange Knowles drops an album that had unicorns and gangstas alike looking for cranes in the sky, the relevantly titled A Seat at the Table. Saadiq was instrumental in helping Solange see through her vision to craft an album that was heralded and lauded by critics from all corners of the musical kingdom.\n\nEven after all of those musical contributions, Saadiq has garnered very few Grammy nods or wins (just one, I believe), and rarely is his name included in conversations about music\u2019s most important or significant figures. Largely, I think it\u2019s due to his vocal range, which isn\u2019t exemplary, though I am a big fan of his voice and vocal performances on recordings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a singer whose strength as a songwriter outshines his vocal abilities, even if he has one of the most distinctive voices in R&B ever. I can\u2019t think of any other reason why somebody who has worked with the range of artists he\u2019s worked with, who\u2019s created the body of work he\u2019s created and been able to successfully create music of different stylings across decades and eras, who has songs that are vital to the listening experience of a particularly strong decade of R&B, and who is responsible for some of the most compelling music of several artists\u2019 careers doesn\u2019t even have an episode of Unsung and might be, textbook, the most unsung black artist ever, considering his contributions.\n\nSaadiq deserves a seat at the table of R&B greats, and hopefully, he gets his due one day.\n\n", "keywords": ["raphael", "solo", "saadiq", "music", "song", "artist", "yeah", "artists", "vocal", "album", "think", "underappreciated", "rb"], "polarity": 0.17916984773982056, "subjectivity": 0.4882617322291236},

We don't know exactly where he left that last fuck, but my guess would be in a bathroom sink in Ben's Chili Bowl on U Street, which is where fucks often go to perish.\n\nAnyway, we're now left with a preeminently fuck denuded Black President. Which matters because when fuck fleeced Black people 1) happen to still be employed and 2) have a predetermined expiration date on said employment, all the Blackness that needed to be suppressed to keep said job has a way of bubbling up.

Or will it be so Black that it even makes other Black people a little uncomfortable?

Will President Obama don his usual \"Guy At The YMCA You Don't Want To Pick On Your Team But Have To Because He's Your Boss And You're Dating His Daughter\" pick-up basketball outfit (white shirt tucked into blue joggers; blue joggers tucked into Under Armour Curry 2 Lows), or will he go full middle-aged Black uncle (either a white linen shorts set with Stacy Adams Cognac colored Belmar Sandals or white tube socks, flip-flops, jean shorts, and a Hanes ComfortBlend v-neck undershirt)?\n\n2. Who will be the White guy holding his own at the Spades table? (Probably Joe Biden. Actually, definitely Joe Biden.)

Is Jesse Williams invited? If so, who will make his plate? (This is a trick question. Because Jesse Williams and his wife definitely make plates for each other.)\n\n4. Who's the official potato salad officiant? Is it Grandma Robinson? (Probably.) Does Michelle handle these duties herself? (Maybe.) Or is this the year they finally allow Malia to experiment with some recipe she learned in homeroom at Sidwell Friends, since its her birthday? (No.)\n\n5. Will every attendee get a red cup at the door, and will they have to write their names on said red cups with dry erase markers? (If so, I can totally see Oprah being asked to write her name on a cup, smiling, reaching in her purse, pulling out her own red cup with a diamond-crusted \"I'm Oprah, Bitches\" emblazoned on it, and walking away.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Will Sasha bring a date, and will the President have a jovial \"conversation\" with said date while two of his scariest secret service agents hover around, like hawks ready to pounce on a Jordan-rocking earthworm?\n\n7. Does Valerie Jarrett lead the Wobble, or does she use this time to grab another bottle of Jamaican Me Happy Seagram's Escapes?\n\n8. Did Kanye's and Kim's invites get, um, lost in the mail again, like what happened last year? (And the year before. And the year before that.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9.

He\u2019s not just creating music for the music\u2019s sake, he\u2019s using the circumstances to make his musical career into a spectacle of its own. He controls the narrative.\n\n\n\nGlover got his artist alias, Childish Gambino, from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. In the same vein, his formative years as an emcee were equally whimsical. Glover didn\u2019t have the obscurity that he should have had during his early emceeing years as he was working to become a competent emcee.\n\nHis initial projects were given more attention than they deserved due to his involvement in Derrick Comedy and his work as a writer for 30 Rock. He later described his 2005 project, The Younger I Get, as the musings of a \u201cdecrepit Drake.\u201d The four projects that followed\u2014Sick Boi, Poindexter, I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2\u2014were released between 2008 and 2010.\n\nHighlights of this era of Childish Gambino include a nasally tone, awkward rhyme schemes, poor mixing and mediocre production. Let\u2019s be clear. These projects have not aged well. They appealed to a number of people who could appreciate his potential, his passion and his vision. He won people over with his earnest hunger and passion, despite his amateurish level of skill. We\u2019ll call this his \u201clet\u2019s build\u201d phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlover\u2019s next project, Culdesac, was the beginning of a much more calculated era in his career. It released in July 2010, only about five months after the release of I Am Not a Rapper 2. Despite the short turnaround time between projects, Culdesac was a major turning point for Gambino. He did not achieve mastery, but he came into his own as both a producer and an emcee. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two happened in tandem.\n\nThe 16-track project, which was entirely self-produced, was a definitive step up from previous releases due to the synergy between his mellow, singsong delivery style and his pop-friendly brand of production. Tracks like the Adele-sampling \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d hit a sweet spot. With this project, he was able to establish himself as a legitimate artist with household potential.\n\nHis March 2011 release, a five-track project called EP, gave us \u201cFreaks And Geeks,\u201d his most technically proficient outing as an emcee, and his most dramatic single up to that point. Gambino was growing by leaps and bounds as an emcee, and he knew it. His narrative of a vulnerable suburban black nerd was replaced by a man who knew he had the juice, thanks to lines such as \u201cNigga can\u2019t you tell, that my sample of Adele, was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowing up my cell?\u201d Clearly, that sample on \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d from Culdesac was doing numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2011, Gambino came back at us with his debut album, Camp. The 13-track project was co-produced in its entirety by his longtime collaborator, Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this was his most musically complex affair. He pieced together more elements than ever before, often haphazardly, and dove into some of the most personal narratives of his career to keep us intrigued in the midst of the chaos.\n\nThis project gave us conflicting emotions, and a complex soundscape to match. He adopted the narrative of being a black, nerdy misfit with this project before transitioning back to pushing for street credit with his next project, Royalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember how excited Gambino was to rap about \u201chood niggas\u201d blowing up his cell on the EP standout \u201cFreaks And Geeks\u201d? He wasn\u2019t joking. Cue Royalty, with guest features from the likes of Nipsey Hussle, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Bun B and Danny Brown. This is the project where Gambino made a noted push to be more accepted by mainstream hip-hop culture. Not only did he have a lot of big-name features, but he switched up his flow and subject matter to match the occasion. Vulnerabilities and insecurities were pushed to the side on songs with big-name features, as he embraced his more braggadocious side.\n\nThe fact that Gambino contended with verses from an aggressive, hungry ScHoolboy Q and a laser-sharp Ab-Soul on \u201cUnnecessary\u201d and didn\u2019t get annihilated in the process is worth talking about.\n\nTwo years earlier, Donald Glover was proud to be stringing multiple punchlines together in one verse. Had he attempted this two years earlier, it would have been ugly. At this point in the game, he had the tools in his arsenal to rise to the occasion, and he did, gaining the approval of a number of more \u201chip-hop purist\u201d-oriented fans in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatisfied with the acclaim swirling around Royalty, Glover moved into a different phase of his career once more, with a different goal in mind. In the same year that he left Community, he released his second studio album, a very mysterious album called Because the Internet.\n\nKeep in mind that Glover was known primarily as a comedian during the formative years of his career as a musician. After the release of Royalty, he had gained a significant amount of respect for his talent as a musician.\n\nBecause the Internet took on a much more experimental, psychedelic feel. Instrumentation was less bright and more nuanced. Subject matter was pushed into more universal territory. While we could feel the ever-present chip on Gambino\u2019s shoulder with previous projects, Because the Internet centered around artistry and pushed hubris to the side. Painting a picture became the focus. Donald Glover wanted to be taken more seriously as an artist, and critics largely did just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2014, Gambino came back with a double release, STN MTN/Kauai. It\u2019s important to note that STN MTN was released as a mixtape, while Kauai was released as en EP. While Kauai served as a more polished, introspective dose of his pop-friendly, R&B alter ego, STN MTN was where he set out to make a statement.\n\nThe first words on STN MTN? \u201cI had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station.\u201d While the project title clearly shouts out his hometown of Stone Mountain, the project is so Atlanta it\u2019s not even funny.\n\nGambino teams up with local mainstay Kari Faux for \u201cSmall Talk,\u201d references Atlanta strip club Follies during interludes, and raps over a host of instrumentals made iconic by Atlanta artists. While it was more beneficial to focus on the Stone Mountain narrative in earlier, more vulnerable projects like Camp, the more cocky, braggadocious Gambino puts on for Atlanta with confidence this time around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe sings a beautiful falsetto cover of Usher\u2019s \u201cU Don\u2019t Have to Call\u201d on the project, and includes an insightful, entertaining narrative at the end. He mentions, \u201cI was never a thug, and they used to respect me for it. But now the game is fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas.\u201d\n\nMichael Corleone is the main protagonist of The Godfather, and he has one key thing in common with Glover; the determination to accomplish his goals by any means, even if it means losing everything in the process and rebuilding from scratch.\n\nIn what might be his most drastic transformation to date, Gambino released Awaken, My Love! on Dec. 2, 2016. In the same way that Michael Corleone destroyed everything that stood in his way in The Godfather, Glover destroyed almost every preconception of his artistry with this project, diving deep into influences such as Bootsy Collins, Parliament and Prince to deliver a spacey, soulful ode to different eras of black artistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe progression he\u2019s taken as an artist is one of a man equally committed to risk-taking and perfection. Most importantly, he\u2019s dedicated to being an artist whose shifts, whims and phases continue to force us to reconsider his limitations. He chooses to hone in on specific elements such as his emceeing, production, singing and composition, adopting different personas to fit the nature of the chapter of his story that he\u2019s penning in the moment.\n\nWhen he feels that he\u2019s mastered a particular element of his artistry, he soars with it and embraces the full vision he has for it, as seen in the braggadocious lyricism of Royalty, the bold experimentalism of Because the Internet, the sharp contrast of STN MTN/Kauai, and the transcendental funk of Awaken, My Love!.\n\nWhen he\u2019s still putting the pieces together, he falls back on the familiarity of his vulnerable, relatable childhood narrative as a black kid who didn\u2019t quite fit in to make himself more relatable. Culdesac and Camp, arguably his two least confidently executed projects, are prime examples of this, as they center around introspection. Glover is one of the most adept musical chameleons in that oftentimes, we don\u2019t even recognize that he\u2019s donned a disguise to shift the way that we receive him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Glover a manipulative mastermind with some sort of dark, underlying motive? Most likely not. Is he a very emotionally intelligent, masterful communicator with a knack for using the reality of his situation and the limitations of his talents to his benefit? Absolutely.\n\nJust remember that in addition to his musical exploits, he will always be an actor, a comedian and a storyteller. His musical career is an integral element of his story as a man and as a creative, and he will always be in complete control of the plot, pulling strings from behind the scenes and watching the audience react from the rafters.", "keywords": ["project", "hiphops", "gambino", "released", "career", "narrative", "adept", "stn", "donald", "hes", "artist", "glover", "projects", "chameleon"], "polarity": 0.12009195893926436, "subjectivity": 0.4956658112346737},

Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over.

Booty songs. Shake jams. Butt bumpers. No matter what you call them, they all bring the same thing to the table: They put asses on the floor, both literally and figuratively.\n\nSongs dedicated to the derriere have long been a staple of the black community. My great uncle Jehosophat Rallo Jenkins Berkshire Jr. II once told me that he\u2019d heard (while working the chitlin circuit in celebration of his debut record, \u201cButt Cheeks Ain\u2019t Nothin\u2019 but a Good Time Masquerading as Child Support Payments,\u201d which, believe it or not, never charted) that before Robert Johnson allegedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical greatness and success, he tried to sell his soul to a waitress in Biloxi because of dat ass.\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the Gluteus Maximi for the World Society\u2014a club built on humanity and core values of booty appreciation\u2014we annually discuss the intersection of kinetics, slow motion and music, and how to best shake that ass for peace, love and soul. It is in this endeavor that we rank booty shake jams. I\u2019m going to let you all in on our annual rankings\u2014for this year only\u2014to see where we landed on some jams whose sole purpose is putting asses in motion on the dance floor.\n\n[As a point of historical note, in December of last year, VSB\u2019s Damon Young pondered what the second-best booty song of all time was and listed a bunch of contenders but never ranked them. In a true sign of how important all of the songs listed are, this ranking was compiled BEFORE I even remembered the booty piece existed. Most of the songs he included made this list. That means these songs are hard science now.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d by Sir Mix-a-Lot\n\nOut of respect for the first to really put asses on the map, this song enters the rankings. Sure, you will never actually hear this at a club where black people congregate, and it\u2019s more likely to be in a set that includes Vanilla Ice and Blink-182, but before the song was co-opted (and ensured Mix a tremendous payday), it was the song that displayed the true appreciation for asses\u2014plus, it\u2019s probably the only video that features a rapper dancing atop a fake ass that would make Jim Henson proud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cPop That\u201d by French Montana, Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne\n\nThis song is so hype you can\u2019t help but getting to gyratin\u2019. Plus it contains a sample of one of the greatest booty songs of all time, which means that of course it would end up as one of the best. Plus it includes, for me, one of Drake\u2019s funnest verses ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cNo Hands\u201d by Waka Flocka Flame, Roscoe Dash, Wale\n\nAll that ass, in them jeans. Probably also features Wale\u2019s most memorable verse ever. With that slow-plodding beat and hook, strippers everywhere showed us how it was done, and dance floor savants were happy to point out, \u201clook ma, no hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cBandz A Make Her Dance\u201d by Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne\n\nNo lie, the most explicit non-stripper dance I\u2019ve ever seen in my life happened to this song at a club in D.C. This woman had an actual audience of men and women watching, didn\u2019t care and proceeded to earn the respect and admiration of all who bore witness. I promise I\u2019m not making this up; people shook her hand after she stopped. Respect due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cShake Ya Ass\u201d by Mystikal\n\nIf you don\u2019t watch yourself and show people what you\u2019re working with while listening to this song, then you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-n-Effect\n\nKids nowadays have no idea about the wonderousness that was \u201cRump Shaker,\u201d featuring a video that was taboo for its time (though today there are church congregations featuring less clothes than the participants of said video), but \u201cRump Shaker\u201d was everything, and everything was \u201cRump Shaker.\u201d To the rump. Yes, all I do wanna do is zooma zoom zoom zoom. It\u2019s really the only way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d by Luke\n\nDon\u2019t stop, pop that *CENSORED*, let me see you Doo Doo Brown. Those words (the whole lyric sheet really) should be handed into the National Archives for permanent commemoration next to the Declaration of Independence for their unapologetic desire to move butts. I know it\u2019s not couth to call an ass jam perfect, but the BPM is way up, the call and response is explicitly ideal for anybody 18+ and the cardio workout potential is unparalleled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cGet Low\u201d by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, Ying Yang Twins\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Lil Jon will be heralded as a prime purveyor of the pop. His whole catalog is perfectly suited for putting that ass on the floor. \u201cGet Low\u201d is a crown jewel of booty usage, especially because of the Ying Yang Twins, in that it\u2019s instructional, educational, great for exercise and ultimately is about teaching the youth the difference between windows and walls, filling a tremendous gap in public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cDa Butt\u201d by E.U.\n\nOne of only two songs guaranteed to ensure a rush of emotions and asses to the floor. Do you have to have a big ol\u2019 butt in order to do da butt? No, you do not. You just have to be willing to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake and able to do \u201cda butt\u201d until it makes you sore. Yeah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cBack That Azz Up\u201d by Juvenile\n\nTo quote Damon, from way back yonder: \u201cBut the best booty song ever, undoubtedly and undisputedly, is \u2018Back That Azz Up.\u2019 There\u2019s no question, no debate, no argument, no discussion.

As a musician\u2026eh. As a songwriter, YES! As a sly shady motherfucker\u2026hmmm. But it takes a God-given talent to be an excellent entertainer, songwriter, guitar shredder and a master of shade. Who else can almost knock the shit out of James Brown fans and still look cool doing it? NO ONE. It\u2019ll be another lifetime before we get another PRINCE NELSON ROGERS. \u2026but we\u2019ll settle for the next Lenny Kravitz.\n\nKeep Alicia Keys in her vocal range\n\nWe all remember when Alicia Keys had the gumption to sing Prince\u2019s \u201cAdore\u201d at the highest of heights from her shallow lungs. Sure, she did an admiral cover of \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me?\u201d But this isn\u2019t the same Alicia Keys of 2001. Maybe she\u2019s been on vocal rest for the past four years. Yet, I still don\u2019t trust her falsetto. Give her something simple to sing like, \u201cSometimes It Snows In April.\u201d Place her ass behind the keyboard and tell her to keep still physically and vocally. There are only a few with the vocal dexterity of Prince, and Alicia isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal are mandatory\n\nSpeaking of vocal dexterity you absolutely have to include at least one of these singers. If you don\u2019t include D\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal, I\u2019ll reduce my cable package to just one channel. And that one channel would be TV One.\n\nMichael Eugene Archer on the guitar is a must. A funky number like \u201cBaby I\u2019m A Star,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna B A Beautiful Night,\u201d \u201cControversy,\u201d \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl In The World,\u201d \u201cAlphabet St.\u201d or his favorite \u201cMovie Star\u201d fits his musical narrative perfectly. Hell, let him do all six of these songs. Maxwell, of course, has to do a slow-burner. Songs like \u201cAdore,\u201d \u201cCall My Name,\u201d and \u201cDo Me Baby\u201d were written for his vocals. And Bilal. What other singer can capture the sadistic, quirky style of Prince? He would be perfect for \u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d or \u201cDarling Nikki.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA duet from Erykah Badu and Andre 3000\n\nHear me out. Go listen to Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d off of her latest. Tell me you can\u2019t hear her and 3 Stacks singing \u201cDiamonds and Pearls\u201d together. Thank you!\n\nInclude the Wonderland squad\n\nEveryone knows Janelle Monae\u2019s musical aptitude and prolific performance capabilities as an entertainer. But it\u2019s her entire movement that resonates and reflects the legacy of Prince. The many talented people Prince put on spans from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to Tevin Campbell. Hell, even Janet Jackson owes Prince credit for the Minneapolis sound on Control and Rhythm Nation. Janelle Monae falls into the same category with her Wonderland crew, particularly Roman GianArthur. I had the pleasure of seeing him live twice. He embodies Prince in both style and musicianship, which is a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInclude the OGs\n\nI\u2019ve listed all of the new schoolers, but we have to mention the old school. It is mandatory that you include Morris Day & The Time, Shelia E. and Wendy and Lisa. These artists worked with him during his prime and literally played an instrumental role in developing the Prince sound of the 80s. It\u2019s blasphemous and disrespectful not to mention their contributions to the Minneapolis sound. Besides, I really want to see Jerome get Morris\u2019 mirror one good time before he lives this earth. Stay strong Jerome\u2026stay strong!\n\nWho should sing Purple Rain?\n\nThis one is complicated. It\u2019s a classic. It really shouldn\u2019t be touched. Yet, it really isn\u2019t a Prince tribute without \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d I mean, no one can really do this song any justice. Not even Patti LaYelle. No disrespect. (Shout out to PattiLaHelle for the reference.) Sure Fanatasia and Jennifer Hudson have the vocal fortitude to carry it. But will they overdo it? And what about the guitar solo? This is why I say choose either one of these singers. Let Lenny Kravitz start it. Add Fantasia or J Hud (not both) to sing the second part. Finally, let Lenny rip the guitar to shreds. It\u2019s the only way our ears can survive a non-karaoke/karaoke version of \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this sounds more like a concert instead of a 20 to 30-minute tribute. And you\u2019re right. This is how much of an impact the musical genius that is Prince has had. So, if the BET Awards starts to look more like a concert in honor of Prince, we wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026at all\n\n(Also, here's another take on a dream tribute guest list that would have been much better than the tribute we shall never speak of again.)\n\nCypress Moss is what peak Negritude looks like.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

The most nominated woman at the Grammys this year, the 27-year-old singer was the crowd favorite to take home the award for Best New Artist, which Alessia Cara ended up winning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she discusses how she felt before and after that night, SZA keeps things all-the-way real in a way that few artists with her level of success do. Like when she discusses how hard it was to deal with the loss publicly:\n\nYou\u2019d think having all of these people excessively posting or vocalizing their support for you after losing would be uplifting and flattering. But on the receiving end, that\u2019s difficult to take. You know, I never looked at the Internet [after the Grammys]. I never looked at anything anyone ever said after that online\u2014not once. The only time I ever heard about it was in person, when someone walked up to me and was like, \u201cYou were robbed\u201d or whatever the fuck. I was like, \u201cI feel you.\u201d My home girl actually showed me Alessia [Cara]\u2019s post and I thought, This is really crazy. I just didn\u2019t know how to take it. I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t post, because I\u2019ve never had to deal with anything I really believed in wholeheartedly, or invested in, and went through something that publicly before. I wanted to be honest as fuck, and if today I\u2019m just mad as hell, I don\u2019t want to say something that reflects me being mad as hell. But I definitely feel blessed now. I also don\u2019t feel compelled to explain myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd battling your ego:\n\nDo you feel like you are in a battle with your ego? Yeah, of course! I don\u2019t think of the ego in terms of who I am to other people. I think of it in terms of who I am to myself and when I take shit personally. Shit like the Grammys. I can have an attitude and really take that shit an ugly-ass way and get caught up in the wrong moment and miss everything about it. Miss the whole blessing in it. But you gotta identify the ego so that you can get over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn SZA\u2019s conversation with Kara Brown at The Fader, the cover of which she graces this month, readers are treated to another side of the performer. She comes off as an artist who\u2019s managed to hold on to herself through the fame and attention\u2014eating ribs, sushi and spinach-artichoke dip, and delivering blunt observations about, life, Ctrl and managing success.\n\nHere\u2019s the alt-R&B singer on eating right:\n\n\u201cTrying to fix my diet.

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock! Awards in New York\u2014you will walk the red carpet alongside stars and have VIP seating to watch the entire show with some of the hottest celebs!\n\n\n\nNot in the market for some of the bigger-ticket items in the auction? EBay for Charity and Black Girls Rock! also partnered with fashion-accessory brand Pintrill to create exclusive enamel pins that are being sold on the platform throughout February. One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report. He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked. Sessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committe hearing with Rosenstein, Bass again wanted answers about documents coming from the FBI that appear to indirectly label the Black Lives Matter movement as a terrorist organization that threatens police. She also noted that members of the Black Lives Matter movement have been questioned by the FBI, yet no one seems to know anything about the document or how the conclusions in said document were made.

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S. While we understand that all of the victims and the activists werent exclusively white, we all know why the country is listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do, too.", "keywords": ["things", "america", "change", "teen", "youre", "nra", "lives", "white", "activists", "efforts", "black", "dear", "walmart", "ask", "gun", "control"], "polarity": 0.030929592959295947, "subjectivity": 0.43710042432814694},

Even though they could find no evidence or substantial proof, federal agencies monitored black organizations and warned local and federal agencies to do the same because ... umm ... well ... did I mention the \u201cblack\u201d part?\n\nAccording to emails and reports published by Al-Jazeera (American media outlets probably missed them because they didn\u2019t contain Donald Trump tweets), the FBI was concerned that Black Lives Matter protests would turn violent after Micah Xavier Johnson killed five police officers in Dallas during a BLM protest in July 2016. The documents, obtained by a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Color of Change and the Center for Constitutional Rights, revealed how federal agencies began monitoring the activities of Black Lives Matter and other groups even though\u2014by the FBI\u2019s own admission\u2014Johnson acted alone and had no ties to Black Lives Matter or any other black organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a number of black supremacist extremist groups in the Dallas-area,\u201d one email read, adding: \u201cthe most prominent of which is the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) which has numerous offshoots.\u201d\n\nThe FBI even thought that these imaginary black supremacists were set to attack the Democratic and Republican conventions, because ... again, they offered no evidence aside from supposition and white-peopleness. One newly uncovered email warned, \u201cDue to sensitivities surrounding recent police shootings, the threat of copycat attacks against law enforcement exists. There is a threat of black supremacist extremists attempting to violently co-opt the upcoming DNC/RNC.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was the cause of this threat? According to an FBI intelligence report obtained by Foreign Policy (pdf), it was Ferguson, Mo.\u2019s very own Michael Brown. Apparently, when Brown offered bullets from Officer Darren Wilson\u2019s service weapon permanent residence inside his chest and head, he was really trying to incite violence ... by dying. The report states:\n\nThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans suppred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence. The FBI assesses itis very likely that this increase began following the 9 August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the subsequent Grand Jury November 2014 declination to indict the police officers involved. The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to deed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother Department of Homeland Security bulletin (pdf) warned law-enforcement agencies across the country about an upcoming Black Lives Matter protest called the Day of Rage. The memo warned: \u201cWhile the media does specify nonviolence and denounces the actions taken against police officers that were not involved in these deaths ... these protests are not safe places to be.\u201d It added: \u201cBeing anywhere near these protests greatly increases the chance that you could become a victim of violence. When the mob mentality takes over, normally decent people can commit heinous acts.\u201d\n\nThe memo was sent to military personnel and police officers all across the country. A former FBI agent and state law-enforcement officer who now works as a federal agent in the Treasury Department said, although he was not involved in the investigation, that the reports could lead to local and federal authorities targeting black groups.\n\n\u201cI have worked in local and federal law enforcement,\u201d he told The Root on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they were trying to do, but I can attest that any street-level officer would read that report and focus on black people and black groups. I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was only one problem with concern over the Day of Rage: It was a hoax. It never happened and it was never planned by Black Lives Matter.\n\nTo be clear, the FBI and Homeland Security have not publicly disclosed any connection between violent extremists and Black Lives Matter or any black organization. There have been no arrests. They have not discovered any evidence, plans or even private conversations concerning violence in the Black Lives Matter network of activists. In fact, the best way to describe these assessments is by using a term that comes from academic and scientific circles:\n\nBullshit.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s own data confirms that 2015, the year after the Michael Brown killing, was one of the safest years for cops ever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only have the FBI and DHS not provided a single shred of evidence to back up their claims, but their own data shows the opposite. According to a separate November 2016 report issued jointly by the FBI and DHS (pdf), white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 \u2026 more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d It is a fabrication wrapped inside a myth covered in lying-motherfucker sauce.\n\nBut those scary black people, though.\n\nRead more at Al-Jazeera.", "keywords": ["documents", "violence", "secretly", "federal", "agencies", "reveal", "lives", "monitored", "violent", "officers", "protests", "black", "supremacist", "fbi", "warned", "matter", "attack", "feared"], "polarity": -0.020869781559436737, "subjectivity": 0.447543165646614},

So, basically, it\u2019s a conversation that proclaims: We schaid what we schaid.\n\n\n\nIt all started in a Slack conversation. Someone (who wishes to remain nameless) from our Jezebel family admitted: \u201cI have to confess. I don\u2019t like Insecure.\u201d What did that person do that for?! Immediately, everyone in the Slack room started responding. First up were some of the core team members from The Root:\n\n\n\nSomeone from The Root: I never have. So you\u2019re not alone.\n\nAnd then i09\u2019s Evan Narcisse joined in: I mentioned to a friend a while back that I\u2019ve never seen a single ep of Queen Sugar, and he was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to! We got options!\u201d\n\nFrom there, the conversation turned into a bold discussion centered on unpopular opinions about TV shows that we should like but are either bored by, uninterested in or just can\u2019t get into at all. These shows are all very popular, like Insecure, Queen Sugar, Game of Thrones, Power and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanielle Belton: I love Queen Sugar, but it is basically just a really well done family soap opera.\n\nSomeone from The Root: I love Queen Sugar but it\u2019s too black for mainstream lol.\n\nDanielle Young: Queen Sugar is so black!\n\nThe conversation turned to the beauty of Queen Sugar but the inherent blackness that keeps it from crossing over into mainstream. And then there was the Game of Thrones slander from yours truly. I do not watch it. Go ahead, be mad, roll your eyes. But I\u2019m not alone in this unpopular opinion.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone from The Root: GOT is garbage.\n\nBut our managing editor, Danielle Belton, was not going to let that person get away with that.\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton: You don\u2019t even watch Game of Thrones!

That is one-and-a-half more than me.\n\nDanielle Young: My eyes glaze over when I try.\n\nSurprisingly, most of the people in the Slack room agreed. They\u2019re not here for Game of Thrones. And then I mentioned a show that I do watch, Claws. I prepared myself for the backlash, but I was met with mutuality from the women of Jezebel, who also think Claws is hilarious.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone from The Root: I just found out Claws wasn\u2019t a comedy ... so maybe I\u2019ll watch it now.\n\nDanielle Young: Claws is like How to Get Away With Murder meets Steel Magnolia.\n\nThe Root\u2019s video editor, P.J.

Belton made it known that Power is damn good TV, while everyone else was like, meh.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristina Blacken: And yes, Power is all the way wack. I don\u2019t get why that show gets a pass.

Naw. Issa no from me. I tried too hard and I hate that damn show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother person who wants to remain nameless: But then you have the incredible Joe Morton!

As the Sacramento Bee defines it, personal recognizance bond \u201callows defendants be released from jail before standing trial without having to pay cash bail.\u201d\n\nMcSpadden also made it very clear to whom he was denying bail. From the Chronicle:\n\n\u201cThe young black men - and it\u2019s primarily young black men rather than young black women - charged with felony offenses, they\u2019re not getting good advice from their parents,\u201d he said. \u201cWho do they get advice from? Rag-tag organizations like Black Lives Matter, which tell you, \u2018Resist police,\u2019 which is the worst thing in the world you could tell a young black man ... They teach contempt for the police, for the whole justice system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden also referred to these defendants as \u201ctainted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost everybody we see here has been tainted in some way before we see them,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey\u2019re not good risks.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday (h/t to the Sacramento Bee), the state\u2019s ACLU chapter called McSpadden\u2019s comments an open admission of racial bias against young black male defendants who appeared before the judge in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there remained any doubt that the deck is stacked against people of color in our criminal justice system, Michael McSpadden just dispelled it,\u201d Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said in the statement.\n\nThe comments, along with the revelation that McSpadden barred magistrates from offering personal bond for years, add to the judge\u2019s troubled history of stripping defendants of their rights.\n\nIn July, McSpadden made headlines after a Houston city councilman accused the felony-court judge of judicial oppression. As the Houston Chronicle reported, Councilman Michael Kubosh, who is also a bail bondsman, said that McSpadden refused to appoint lawyers to low-income clients who were free on bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcSpadden\u2019s policy was to require most defendants free on bail to hire their own lawyer. If they did not, he ordered them to come to court daily until a lawyer was hired. McSpadden\u2019s rationale was cartoonishly simple: If you can make bail, you can afford a lawyer; underprivileged clients who asked for court-appointed attorneys were regularly denied them by McSpadden.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be this hard,\u201d Kubosh told the Chronicle at the time. \u201cThey do this to oppress the person to take a plea or give up and just make a deal.

The most nominated woman at the Grammys this year, the 27-year-old singer was the crowd favorite to take home the award for Best New Artist, which Alessia Cara ended up winning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she discusses how she felt before and after that night, SZA keeps things all-the-way real in a way that few artists with her level of success do. Like when she discusses how hard it was to deal with the loss publicly:\n\nYou\u2019d think having all of these people excessively posting or vocalizing their support for you after losing would be uplifting and flattering. But on the receiving end, that\u2019s difficult to take. You know, I never looked at the Internet [after the Grammys]. I never looked at anything anyone ever said after that online\u2014not once. The only time I ever heard about it was in person, when someone walked up to me and was like, \u201cYou were robbed\u201d or whatever the fuck. I was like, \u201cI feel you.\u201d My home girl actually showed me Alessia [Cara]\u2019s post and I thought, This is really crazy. I just didn\u2019t know how to take it. I didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t post, because I\u2019ve never had to deal with anything I really believed in wholeheartedly, or invested in, and went through something that publicly before. I wanted to be honest as fuck, and if today I\u2019m just mad as hell, I don\u2019t want to say something that reflects me being mad as hell. But I definitely feel blessed now. I also don\u2019t feel compelled to explain myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd battling your ego:\n\nDo you feel like you are in a battle with your ego? Yeah, of course! I don\u2019t think of the ego in terms of who I am to other people. I think of it in terms of who I am to myself and when I take shit personally. Shit like the Grammys. I can have an attitude and really take that shit an ugly-ass way and get caught up in the wrong moment and miss everything about it. Miss the whole blessing in it.

Trying to cut back on a lot of things just \u2018cause your body is a machine and needs shit to energize the focus, and if I\u2019m high eating ribs all the time, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on managing her schedule:\n\nWhen I tell her she looks like she\u2019s just come from the woods, she purrs and playfully faux-primps her hair: \u201cOh my god.

Please stop.\u201d Originally, she wanted to take me to \u201cthe forest\u201d and \u201csmoke me out,\u201d but plans changed due to a hectic timetable filled with preparations for her trip. \u201cThe art of squeezing shit in,\u201d she says, shaking her head.\n\nThis was SZA\u2019s reaction to hearing that her song \u201cBroken Clocks\u201d (which still brings her dad to tears) made it to former President Barack Obama\u2019s list of favorite songs of 2017:\n\nAppropriately, she heard the news while she was in Hawaii, his home state. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird \u2018cause I had been talking about Obama since I landed in Hawaii,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is it weird if I DM his daughters and ask to hang out?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, never mind I\u2019m gonna smoke weed,\u2019\u201d she laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on the disconnect between how she perceived Ctrl and how the rest of the world saw it:\n\nFor all the success and all the acclaim, there\u2019s still a disconnect between how SZA sees herself and how the world sees her. \u201cI didn\u2019t even fuck with my own album, so I was so confused and almost, like, angry that everyone fucked with it so much,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant everything I felt about myself was wrong.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["solved", "im", "plan", "crime", "right", "nra", "racist", "donald", "lives", "trump", "gun", "white", "black", "stuff", "think", "know", "matter"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Wagstaff III, including reports and internal communications from the department\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit, make up the basis for the group\u2019s allegations that Clarkstown police racially profiled the group\u2019s members and violated their rights to free speech and assembly. The documents show that the police department\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit\u2014 established in 2013 between the department and the county DA\u2019s office to gather intelligence on suspected criminals\u2014conducted social-media surveillance on BLM activists and continued to do so even after the unit\u2019s supervisor was told by the lead detective in the prosecutor\u2019s office that the surveillance had to stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote, even when a lead detective told the police to stop with their nonsense, they allegedly continued on with this illegal activity.\n\nOf course, this is not the first time that activists have voiced suspicions or concerns that they were being surveilled; however, as Mother Jones notes, the documents provided in this case represent some of the clearest evidence yet that activists are not making this shit up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, in Clarkstown, the special unit made use of a \u201cgeofence\u201d twice in November 2015 to monitor the Twitter and/or Instagram accounts of activists. Through the geofences\u2014which enable virtual tracking of activity within a geographic area\u2014the cops (and users in general, mind you) were able to track the social media posts of a targeted audience within a time frame and to store and analyze the time and location of that data. A report from December 2015 detailed that officers monitored and tracked the social media activity of activists on six occasions.\n\nMother Jones also managed to get an email exchange between former Chief Detective Peter Modafferi of the Rockland County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the former head of Clarktown\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit, Sgt. Stephen Cole-Hatchard. In the emails, Moafferi writes, \u201cI mentioned before, you really should not have Black Lives Matter listed as a target of surveillance.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg in the suit. The suit claims that Clarkstown police even went so far as to put snipers on the roofs of buildings during rallies led by the BLM group in the summer of 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe intention is to illegally surveil people with the hope that they can silence them,\u201d William Wagstaff, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, told Mother Jones.\n\nAnd aside from the obvious paper trail, the group seems to have a slam dunk of a case. In July 2016, Clarkstown Police Chief Michael Sullivan was suspended, partially because of evidence that his intelligence unit illegally surveilled a community group called We the People, as well as the local BLM chapter. Sullivan was ultimately fired in September.\n\nMother Jones notes:\n\nA special prosecutor had been hired by the town supervisor (the equivalent of a mayor) to investigate the unit and had uncovered evidence of improper surveillance targeting Sullivan\u2019s perceived political enemies\u2014including the county sheriff, a judge, the supervisor himself, and even residents who supported cutting the police department\u2019s budget. The investigation resulted in more than a dozen disciplinary charges against Sullivan\u2014who was found guilty for 11 of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in January, We the People filed its own lawsuit against the police intelligence unit, claiming that the unit had tracked the group on social media. We the People ultimately settled its case in July for $300,000.\n\nAs for the BLM group, it is seeking unspecified monetary damages, as well as a cease and desist order against the intelligence unit, whose reports are also shared with neighboring law-enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice\u2014which is probably a legit move, given bogeyman initiatives like the one launched by the FBI to target \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Mother Jones.", "keywords": ["county", "spying", "accuses", "targeting", "clarkstown", "ny", "attention", "intelligence", "jones", "lives", "calling", "activists", "black", "mother", "group", "unit", "matter", "blm"], "polarity": -0.010698824984539269, "subjectivity": 0.44775561739847447},

WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN???\n\nThe deal became official last Friday (June 30th), but it had been in the works for four months.\n\nI NEED A MINUTE OR TWO TO SIT DOWN.\n\nSure. Take all of the time you need. I'll be here.\n\n***two minutes pass***\n\nOk, I'm back.\n\nBetter now?\n\nMaybe? I think so?\n\nIt's cool. Trust me, I've had dozens of similar moments over the past calendar year. Even now, while writing this, I feel anxious. Not a bad anxious though. More of a surreality anxious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have so many questions.\n\nI have so many answers.\n\nI don't know where to start.\n\nThat's fine. I'll start for you.\n\nOver the past year and a half, we've been approached by several different entities interested in some sort of partnership. Some wanted to merge us with already existing platforms. Others were interested in creating something new. Univision was one of those entities, and we believed that joining them was the best opportunity for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnivision though? That's a surprise.\n\nNot if you're aware of the business of digital media. In the past year and a half, Univision acquired Gizmodo Media Group (GMG) \u2014 home of Deadspin, Jezebel, Fusion, The Root, Lifehacker, Jalopnik, Gizmodo, and Kotaku \u2014 and also has a 40% stake in The Onion (which includes the AV Club and Clickhole). These are some of the most popular and beloved spaces on the Internet, and we're going to be a part of that ecosystem. Specifically, we're going to be a vertical of The Root. VSB will still be VSB, though.\n\nSo you're still going to run VSB?\n\nYes. Only now we're going to be Univision employees.\n\nSo basically you're getting paid to do something you've been doing for free for nine years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExactly!\n\nSo\u2026while I understand that, why even partner? I mean, you all seem to be doing pretty well already. You already got a book deal and a gig at GQ, and both you and Panama seem to get invited all over the country to speak. Why not just remain completely autonomous?\n\nBoth Panama and I have had ambitions to grow VSB, and we've been lucky enough to be able to do that. We currently get around two million unique visitors per month \u2014 a far cry from the day when I did a celebratory Harlem Shake the first time we cracked 100,000. But we are a staff of one and a half people \u2014 me and Panama (whose day job limits how much time he's able to devote to VSB). That's it. Which means that along with writing and editing, we're responsible for all of the logistical and administrative duties necessary for maintaining VSB. That means (sometimes) reading and (sporadically) replying to the hundreds of emails we get per day, monitoring each of VSB's social media accounts, moderating the thousands of comments we receive, and the rest of the daily and weekly responsibilities I'm neglecting to mention. And doing all of that shit takes time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, you may have noticed that our content has decreased in frequency over the past few months. That's because we've had to devote time and energy to all of the conversations \u2014 emails, texts, phone calls, and meetings \u2014 regarding this deal. (Plus, I'm writing a book, which obviously requires time and attention too.)\n\nBasically, as long as one and a half people were required to do the jobs of seven or eight, our potential for growth would always be limited. With this deal, however, we'll be able to focus our attention on being creative, since GMG and The Root have those administrative infrastructures in place. And we'll have access to Univision's amazing resources. (Which means we'll be able to do podcasts, short videos and more panels and events.) And we'll have a budget to pay writers actual competitive rates instead of the bite-sized Snickers and lapdances from Panama we offer now. (Which means you'll see more of us and more of people like Alex Hardy and Shamira Ibrahim.) And Panama is leaving his job to work full-time on VSB now too. (And neither of us will have to move anywhere. He's staying in D.C. and I'm staying in Pittsburgh.)\n\nShit, Panama is leaving his job? Isn't he a government employee in D.C. with a government-employee-in-D.C. salary and benefits?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes.\n\nWow. That's major.\n\nIt is.\n\nSo, you've told us about all of the positive aspects of this deal. What are the downsides?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, I wouldn't quite call it a downside, but while the content and tone of VSB won't change, we're going to be fully integrated into GMG's Kinja system, which means the comment section will change considerably. But, if the people who comment regularly here sign up with Kinja, the change will be more aesthetic than foundational. It'll take some adjustments, but we still should be able to maintain the same robust community we do now. When we find out more about that integration process, we'll let you all know. Probably some time next week.\n\nAlso, we're giving up control of something we created nine years ago and have been nurturing since.

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

She was describing Bennett\u2019s participation in a documentary about the story of black people in Chicago, where he lived for 35 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis 1963 seminal work, Before the MayFlower, traces Black history from its origins in Western Africa through the trans-Atlantic sojourn that would be slavery, the Reconstruction, and the upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d Pearson-McNeil continued. A 2008 exhibit about Bennett at Chicago\u2019s DuSable Museum of African American History called him \u201cthe people\u2019s historian.\u201d\n\nJoy Bennett noted the significance of the timing of her father\u2019s passing. \u201cDad would die on Valentine\u2019s Day in the heart of Black History Month. He even went out as a historian,\u201d she said by telephone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack History Month began as Negro History Week, commemorating Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday, Feb. 12, and Feb. 14, which Frederick Douglass celebrated as his day of birth.\n\nOne of Bennett\u2019s most controversial books cast Lincoln in less than a glowing light.\n\n\u201cThe real Lincoln, the author says, was a conservative politician who said repeatedly that he believed in White supremacy,\u201d according to the dust jacket of \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream,\u201d published in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot only that: He opposed the basic principle of the Emancipation Proclamation until his death and was literally forced \u2014 Count Adam Gurowski said he was literally whipped \u2014into the glory of having issued the Emancipation Proclamation,\u201d which Lincoln drafted in such a way that it did not in and of itself free a single slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cForced into Glory\u201d won the 2002 American Book Award.\n\nBennett also co-wrote 1989's \u201cSucceeding Against the Odds: The Inspiring Autobiography of One of America\u2019s Wealthiest Entrepreneurs,\u201d the story of John H. Johnson, co-founder of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers of Ebony and Jet magazines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe helped create the foundations of this [African American] struggle in the forties and fifties when the ground was hard and there were few laborers,\u201d Johnson wrote in the book. \u201c. . . we anticipated the changes and gave focus and form to them. In 1959, for example, I detected a growing interest in Black history and authorized a pathfinding Black history series. The response was so enthusiastic that we published a book, Lerone Bennett\u2019s Before the Mayflower, which became one of the most widely read Black History books ever. This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff. Her father demanded that his name be removed from the masthead, where Bennett was listed as executive editor emeritus. The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson. One of his proudest moments came in 2007, when he was honored by the Mississippi State Senate. He said he never thought he\u2019d live long enough to see a black man so welcome in the state Capitol.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m 78 years old. I thought I would die before I saw this,\u2019 Bennett said. \u2018Thank you for making it possible for me to see the great dream that could be realized in this state,\u2019 \u201c Holbrook Mohr reported then for the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2002 profile by the HistoryMakers, \u201cBennett attended Morehouse College, earning a B.A. in 1949. He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached. The walk, established in 2004, now includes 50 pairs of footprints, marked in granite, from people who organizers call the \u2018foot-soldiers\u2019 of the civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cFormer President Bill Clinton appointed Bennett to the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. President George W. Bush appointed him to the Presidential Commission to study the proposed National Museum of African-American History and Culture, according to the Senate resolution passed in his honor.\u201d He was too ill to attend the museum\u2019s 2016 opening, Joy Bennett said, but he watched it on television.\n\n\u201cThough Bennett was born in Clarksdale, he moved with his family to Jackson at an early age where he was greatly influenced by teachers at Lanier High School,\u201d the story continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m indebted first to the black teachers of Mississippi, who literally saved my life,\u2019 he said. \u2018The great black school teachers in Clarksdale and Jackson told me I could dream and do anything.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBennett is survived by three daughters, Courtney and Constance Bennett of San Diego, Calif., and Alma Joy of Chicago. Their brother, Lerone Bennett III, died in 2013; their mother, former Johnson Publishing Co. journalist Gloria Sylvester, in 2009. He also leaves three granddaughters.

Unfortunately our attempts to meet with the journalists in prison was repeatedly denied, but Ferial and I were able to meet with some family members.

On Tuesday, three more organizations \u2014 Citizens Bank, the Massachusetts State Lottery, and the Massachusetts Health Connector \u2014 cut ties with WEEI.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor those keeping score at home, that means at least five advertisers \u2014 including Comcast Corp. and City of Boston Credit Union \u2014 have either terminated or suspended commercial buys on the popular sports talk station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEntercom, WEEI\u2019s owner and one of the biggest radio companies in the country, is condoning a culture of hate and acceptance of the unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe reason some advertisers are taking their money elsewhere is simple.

Yee, who is of Chinese descent and was born in the United States, speaks English without an accent; he represents Brady and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Friday, WEEI suspended Fauria for five days, characterizing his behavior as an \u2018insensitive and ill-conceived attempt at humor.\u2019\n\n\u201cHis reprimand came two weeks after the suspension of another WEEI personality, Alex Reimer. The fill-in host was suspended indefinitely after using a derogatory phrase to describe Brady\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u201cFor too long, WEEI drove ratings by spewing hate and vitriol disguised as sports talk.

But in the short term, the Trump-backed immigration proposal, combined with other recent moves by the administration and its allies \u2014 support for voter suppression, gerrymandering and various other schemes to disenfranchise minority voters \u2014 could extend the white hegemony that brought Trump to power and sustains Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor ages, Republicans said that their beef was with illegal immigrants and that legal immigrants should be embraced and welcomed. No longer. In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security. The dispute is really about the Trump proposal to rein in legal immigration by undoing the family-based approach, in which immigrants petition to bring over immediate family, that has always been at the heart of U.S. immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough details aren\u2019t yet known, estimates are that the legislation would cut legal immigration, currently 1.1 million per year, by 300,000 to 500,000 annually.

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

They want everyone else in America to see us as a threat so that when we are killed with impunity, no one bats an eyelash. This is already happening anyway.\n\nIn a country that was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it appears that you can fully reap those benefits only if you are not black, and if you are black and want those benefits, then you need to keep your mouth closed so that you can have the illusion of getting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new buzz phrase is \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d and since it has been coined by the FBI, we can accurately assume that this is COINTELPRO 2.0. It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base. They do this while simultaneously normalizing white supremacist and white nationalist ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people wanting justice and equality is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d while a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., complete with torches, Nazi insignia and an innocent woman being killed, is normal.\n\nAs someone said on Twitter, all we have asked is for the repeated killing of unarmed black men and women by police to stop and for justice in those cases where it does happen. This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["human", "attack", "extremism", "basic", "narrative", "rights", "isnt", "cant", "lives", "white", "fighting", "black", "bie", "killed", "way", "felicia", "extreme", "justice"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

The FBI report was released on Aug. 3\u2014just nine days before a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign Policy obtained the report, which is marked for official use only. The document warns that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d pose a growing threat to law enforcement. In a particularly cruel and unfounded assertion, the FBI claims that police attacks on black Americans could spur \u201cpremeditated, retaliatory lethal violence\u201d against the police.\n\nFrom Foreign Policy:\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \u201calleged\u201d police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight. Because the response to Michael Brown\u2019s death was the first instance of black people voicing outrage about police brutality.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically call out Black Lives Matter, the group certainly is the subtext of the document. As Foreign Policy rightly notes, 168 black Americans have been shot and killed by the police in 2017 alone. Law enforcement has killed 748 people in all this year so far.\n\nThat\u2019s 748 lives in less than 10 months, nearly a quarter of them black.\n\nMeanwhile, the report lists six total acts of premeditated violence against officers, including the shooting death of Dallas police officers at a BLM rally in July 2016. The shooter, Micah Johnson, wasn\u2019t affiliated with BLM but was reportedly \u201cinfluenced by BIE ideology,\u201d based on his journals and statements to police, according to the FBI report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is the latest iteration of a long tradition of the FBI targeting and tracking black activists. The most famous example is COINTELPRO, which was created in 1956 with the explicit intent to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist[s],\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s own documents. Then, as now, the people the feds are actually targeting were mostly activists fighting to advance racial equality.\n\n\n\nOr, at the very least, stop the government from ceaselessly, and with impunity, killing black people and people of color.\n\nEarlier this year, The Intercept reported that the FBI began investigating white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement in 2015. That classified document was crafted, notably, under the Obama administration, and warned of white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in \u201cinfiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did release a report earlier this year that warned that the white supremacist movement \u201clikely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\u201d However, the new guidance on \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d draws a dangerous equivocation between a movement that is seeing a visible resurgence and one that seems completely conjured by the FBI.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, this new guidance has raised eyebrows among the intelligence community, with one former official expressing shock at the report\u2019s contents.\n\n\u201cThis is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\u201d the former official told FP. \u201cThere are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Foreign Policy.", "keywords": ["law", "launches", "enforcement", "violence", "cointelpro", "targeting", "20", "movement", "policy", "white", "black", "identity", "extremists", "report", "foreign", "fbi"], "polarity": -0.032507111935683376, "subjectivity": 0.4133005565862708},

She comes off as an artist who\u2019s managed to hold on to herself through the fame and attention\u2014eating ribs, sushi and spinach-artichoke dip, and delivering blunt observations about, life, Ctrl and managing success.\n\nHere\u2019s the alt-R&B singer on eating right:\n\n\u201cTrying to fix my diet. Trying to cut back on a lot of things just \u2018cause your body is a machine and needs shit to energize the focus, and if I\u2019m high eating ribs all the time, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on managing her schedule:\n\nWhen I tell her she looks like she\u2019s just come from the woods, she purrs and playfully faux-primps her hair: \u201cOh my god. Dream. Please. Please stop.\u201d Originally, she wanted to take me to \u201cthe forest\u201d and \u201csmoke me out,\u201d but plans changed due to a hectic timetable filled with preparations for her trip. \u201cThe art of squeezing shit in,\u201d she says, shaking her head.\n\nThis was SZA\u2019s reaction to hearing that her song \u201cBroken Clocks\u201d (which still brings her dad to tears) made it to former President Barack Obama\u2019s list of favorite songs of 2017:\n\nAppropriately, she heard the news while she was in Hawaii, his home state. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird \u2018cause I had been talking about Obama since I landed in Hawaii,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is it weird if I DM his daughters and ask to hang out?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, never mind I\u2019m gonna smoke weed,\u2019\u201d she laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on the disconnect between how she perceived Ctrl and how the rest of the world saw it:\n\nFor all the success and all the acclaim, there\u2019s still a disconnect between how SZA sees herself and how the world sees her. \u201cI didn\u2019t even fuck with my own album, so I was so confused and almost, like, angry that everyone fucked with it so much,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant everything I felt about myself was wrong.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["theres", "situation", "right", "child", "family", "gaines", "korryn", "hes", "speaks", "lives", "wont", "mothers", "baltimore", "mother", "dormeus", "rest", "pain"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face.

It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face.

Meaning, while Truth was from the Northeast and spoke Dutch as well as English, for some reason, the most famous variations of the speech are written in an overwrought Southern dialect.\n\nIn an older recounting of her speech, Truth questions the inherent hypocritical nature of sexism, challenging that if she could eat, work and be as strong as any man, she should, in turn, have the same as a man.\n\nBut racism, the thief that robs black women twice, stripped Truth of her womanhood and humanity.\n\nThis is the burden of black womanhood, where one must fight for the right to be equal, to be considered a woman (in both the traditional and progressive sense) and to be human, all at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is out of that paradox that the majority of the lady people of The Root are sitting this day out as part of International Women\u2019s Day, also known as the day of the International Women\u2019s Strike, also known as \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d brought to you by the same women who brought you the Women\u2019s March earlier this year.\n\nLike our foremother who spoke up for all women when most certainly no one was treating her like one, the black women of The Root are aware that this is a complicated issue. But, like Sister Sojourner, we\u2019re making our voices heard anyway. Damn time, place, race or tradition. We\u2019re not waiting for someone else to show up and speak on our behalf. We\u2019re not waiting for someone to \u201cgift\u201d us of our rights and autonomy.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["riots", "tchalla", "history", "help", "folks", "cant", "black", "killmonger", "panther", "wanted", "know", "revisionist", "njobu"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.\n\nHolmes calls the children of interracial marriage born between 1960 and 1985 \u201cthe Loving Generation,\u201d though where I\u2019m from, we just call us mixed. Or black. Mostly black. Or \u201cYou know you black, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have quite a few qualms about the piece, especially as a mixed person who identifies as black whose picture is included in the actual op-ed\u2014which, petty or not, makes me feel as if I co-signed the opinions and perspective. I did not. All of us who are pictured in the op-ed are also part of a supplement to the documentary series. I can\u2019t speak for anybody else involved, but I took issue with much of the op-ed because our experiences as mixed people are varied in a way that the piece mutes.\n\n1. I HATE the title. \u201cBlack With (Some) White Privilege\u201d conjures up that time Very Smart Brotha\u2019s own Damon Young wrote \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People..\u201d I got why folks hated that title then (even if I agreed in principle with his argument), and I hate this even more. Damon\u2019s piece stated that male privilege exists and that black males have some privilege by virtue of being male. THIS piece alleges that mixed kids exercise some sort of white privilege by virtue of having a white parent. I think this entire premise is flawed; it is ENTIRELY circumstantial. She\u2019s somehow conflating colorism with proximity to whiteness, and they\u2019re two entirely different things.\n\nYou can be light-skinned with two black parents and receive the same benefits from lightness as a person who is mixed. And what if you\u2019re a dark-skinned mixed person\u2014somebody whose background is entirely impossible to tell from skin tone\u2014and receive no \u201cbenefits\u201d? Then what? Do you still have some white privilege because of your white parent? Like, do they need to show up to prove it? Maybe you just can\u2019t use it in person, only on paper?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I don\u2019t like this idea that there was some overarching political decision that so many black-and-white couples made after the Supreme Court decision to somehow stick it (no pun intended) to white supremacy by creating mixed children. While I\u2019m sure that some white folks absolutely rebelled in the form of their bedroom decisions, and some black folks took that opportunity, do we really believe that people are thinking about a Supreme Court decision when they meet and go through life together? I doubt it. If there\u2019s any proximity argument, I think this is where it exists. Most of these relationships\u2014whether married or not\u2014were born of desire, love and actual proximity.\n\n3. This passage:\n\nHow does having one white parent change that \u201ctwice as good\u201d calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how you have an idea, then you find ideas to support it even if holes can be shot through it? So there are more mixed people than you\u2019d expect in the \u201cleaders and luminaries\u201d category. OK. Holmes points out several at the beginning of the piece, namely actors, politicos, entertainers, athletes, etc.\n\nFor some, in particular entertainers and politicos, it would be asinine to suggest that their skin tone\u2014folks like Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Halle Berry\u2014doesn\u2019t play a role in their success; their being mixed also contributed to their skin tone, of course. Carey may be an outlier because of her once-in-a-lifetime talent (the same with Derek Jeter and Jason Kidd, also name-checked in the article). But proximity to whiteness didn\u2019t help them out as much as their complexion. And how do you reconcile that with folks like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna (and, hell, Muhammad Ali) who are (or was) light-skinned with two black parents? Are they just otherworldly talents? What about their white proximity?\n\n4. Then this passage:\n\nSometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not proximity, it\u2019s access to white people that begets other access to white people and the white power structure. I\u2019m connected to white people, so other white folks can tell and thus make an easier pathway toward success. Which, again, works if you can tell that a person is mixed and thus make a conscious decision because of it.\n\nWhat about the rest of us who aren\u2019t that easily discernible as mixed? What about our success? Not all heroes wear capes, and not all mixed people look like Meghan Markle. Or Vanessa Williams. Some of us actually aren\u2019t that noticeable and are considered light-skinned black folks by society writ large until we show up with or tell you we have a white parent. Doors don\u2019t open at that point either, by the way.\n\n5. And this:\n\nIt\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree that President Barack Obama\u2019s proximity to whiteness absolutely helped shape his worldview, and being around white people who loved him unequivocally was a boon for him. Did that make him believe he could be the first black president? Eh. My black parents made me believe that I could, too. But being president seems like a terrible job, so I\u2019ve never had the smallest of inklings to want to go down that road. Now, I suppose the question is, did I actually think that I could? Whereas maybe Obama always believed it with his whole heart? That\u2019s a legit question.\n\n6. Holy mother of God:\n\nI knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness \u2014 and my own perception and self-consciousness of it \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the foreground. What I didn\u2019t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I\u2019d accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m mixed\u2014my mother is a white woman\u2014and I have never moved around white people with relative ease, though I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means, either. In fact, short of my white mother, grandmother and stepfather, I am rarely around whiteness. I live in predominantly black cities and went to an HBCU and could literally put \u201cprofessional black person\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without a hint of comedy. I think most folks would call me successful, so how would we qualify that success? And what about dark-skinned black people who move with ease around white people?\n\n7. For heaven\u2019s sake:\n\nTurns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. \u201cAt my job, there\u2019s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, is that because there\u2019s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting promotions and why we\u2019re moving forward?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can\u2019t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love my mother, who is white. We do nothing but argue and have nothing in common. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m just an exception to this whole mixed life that others manage to live.\n\n8. Yep:\n\nThe writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told \u201cThe Loving Generation\u201d director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. \u201cOur ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,\u201d she said. She wonders, however, what the return is \u2014 that is, where do we go from here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed-race fluidity? What is that? Is that a thing? (It\u2019s not.) I\u2019m mixed and I view life through a very, very black-perspective lens. Because that\u2019s my life; I\u2019m black. How do you even see things with a white perspective? What is that? I\u2019m REALLY asking. \u201cMixed-race fluidity\u201d implies that you have some choices and can move easily between worlds. I don\u2019t care to do that, but in my experiences, that\u2019s not a thing. Being mixed just means that you don\u2019t choose black, not that you are somehow white. Because that\u2019s not a choice you actually have outside of the confines of your own mind and friends who let you cook.\n\n9. It goes on, but that\u2019s my larger issue with this piece: You can\u2019t decide that colorism isn\u2019t at the heart of whatever \u201cprivilege\u201d is being attributed to whiteness. Mixed people come in so many different shades that you can\u2019t always tell. Sure, some mixed folks are lighter and thus, perhaps, benefit in ways that other mixed folks may not, but that\u2019s not because they\u2019re mixed; it\u2019s because they\u2019re light-skinned.\n\nWhat about me? I\u2019m light-skinned, but I seriously doubt that there\u2019s some significant benefit I\u2019ve received, even though I\u2019d wager that I have received some by virtue of my less-than-threatening visage. Saying that black folks receive white privilege is problematic because it entirely DISCOUNTS light-skinned points, something we joke about in the black community that is a real thing. You don\u2019t need to be half-white for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The most I\u2019ve ever discussed being \u201cmixed\u201d has been over the past six months. My life has been a largely black one since I was a child. I was raised in a black household, with some summers spent with my white mom in quasi-rural Michigan, where I was always aware of my blackness. Articles such as this push me further into the belief that my parents really did me a solid by not giving me a choice or considering me to be mixed in order to make sure I honored both of my parents. I am able to do so without trying to claim some racial connection that white people have spent centuries trying to remove from me.\n\nPlus, why would I want that? I can love my white mother and be black. But more important, to me, it\u2019s REALLY OK to be black. I don\u2019t need to focus on the white proximity or the adjacency or the gaze. I can be equally successful as a black person who fully embraces that part of myself. There\u2019s a reason I never think about whether my being mixed is partially responsible for my success\u2014I don\u2019t make it a thing. I don\u2019t allow others to focus on it. It\u2019s why I not only get to go to the cookout, but I can also bring macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can acknowledge that I receive some benefits because I\u2019m light-skinned\u2014because I am. I also have the wherewithal to acknowledge that my black parents (and sometimes, ironically, my white mother) raised a black man who is comfortable with his accomplishments, without also feeling as if the whiteness in my veins that nobody knows exists is the reason for those accomplishments. That\u2019s my beef with the piece and its centering so much whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause it really is OK to black.", "keywords": ["holmes", "im", "whiteness", "dont", "thoughts", "folks", "thats", "times", "white", "oped", "mixed", "black", "proximity", "york", "privilege", "anna"], "polarity": 0.08471439626681555, "subjectivity": 0.38245688451333604},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A.

The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation.

Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d\n\nTo donate to Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber\u2019s funeral expenses, go here.", "keywords": ["shot", "los", "neighborhood", "community", "weber", "young", "black", "aj", "death", "angeles", "anthony", "16yearold", "reels", "killing"], "polarity": -0.0647421536796537, "subjectivity": 0.4544421296296296},

Michael Cheers, professor of photojournalism at San Jose State University and co-author of Masekela\u2019s 2004 autobiography, Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela. He has been Masekela\u2019s friend for 30 years.\n\n\u201cThis is tough: two mighty trees have fallen....Edwin Hawkins and I were in the 4th year of a documentary project, \u2018And Live Rejoicing Every Day - Oh Happy Day\u2019, when he passed last Monday,\u201d Cheers messaged Journal-isms on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis morning I got the news about Ramapolo Hugh Masekela. . . .\u201d\n\nHawkins, a Grammy Award-winning singer best known for the gospel crossover hit \u201cOh Happy Day,\u201d a chart-topper in 1969, died Jan. 15 at 74.\n\nAnd as Giovanni Russonello reported Tuesday in the New York Times, \u201cMasekela, a South African trumpeter, singer and activist whose music became symbolic of the country\u2019s anti-apartheid movement, even as he spent three decades in exile, died on Tuesday in Johannesburg. He was 78. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cBra Hugh, as he was affectionately known, opened many doors for me in South Africa and across the continent. He placed me on the front row of African history and culture.\n\n\u201cHe helped me gain access to Nelson Mandela and other South African government officials, business people, and of course, a plethora of artists and musicians.\n\n\u201cI remember while researching the book, we spent hours in Witbank, the township near Pretoria, where he was born. Bra Hugh wanted me to feel and understand the rituals and nuances of his upbringing. I remember standing with him on the dusty railroad tracks in the township gaining a deeper understanding of his soul-stirring song, \u2018Stimela\u2019 \u201c (video). That song is about the life of coal miners from southern and central Africa conscripted to work for long hours and little pay in unhealthy South African mines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn another afternoon he was driving me through Alexandria Township when he stopped his sedan, pulled out his horn and began serenading the neighbors. He introduced me to Miriam Makeba, who took me into her confidence, cooked dinner for me on many occasions, and shared stories over the years about her anti-Apartheid work in the [States]. His sister Barbara [Masekela], South Africa\u2019s Ambassador to Washington, D.C. in the 1990s, was another source for details and good conversation.\u201d Masekela and Makeba married in 1964, but divorced after two years.\n\nRussonello added in his obituary, \u201cMr. Masekela came to the forefront of his country\u2019s music scene in the 1950s, when he became a pioneer of South African jazz as a member of the Jazz Epistles, a bebop sextet that included the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim and other future stars. After a move to the United States in 1960, he won international acclaim and carried the mantle of his country\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\n\u201cHis biggest hit was \u2018Grazing in the Grass,\u2019 a peppy instrumental from 1968 with a twirling trumpet hook and a jangly cowbell rhythm. In the 1980s, as the struggle against apartheid hit a fever pitch, he worked often with fellow expatriate musicians, and with others from different African nations. On songs like \u2018Stimela (Coal Train),\u2019 \u2018Mace and Grenades\u2019 and the anthem \u2018Mandela (Bring Him Back Home),\u2019 he played spiraling, plump-toned trumpet lines and sang of fortitude and resisting oppression in a gravelly tenor, landing somewhere between a storyteller\u2019s incantation and a folk singer\u2019s croon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the 1970s and \u201880s, he collaborated with musicians across sub-Saharan Africa, constantly expanding his style to accommodate a range of traditions. ...\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Roland Martin on TVOne\u2019s News One Now (video), Masekela bemoaned the lack of respect for black and African history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Africa, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been convinced that our heritage is barbaric, it\u2019s savage, it\u2019s primitive, it\u2019s heathen, it\u2019s pagan. And we\u2019ve bought that, so we celebrate other cultures instead and put ourselves into other cultures and pushed our heritage to the side. We can\u2019t even remember Motown, it\u2019s a little example. . . .\n\n\u201cI was talking to somebody in the dressing room, and I said like, if you look at the British, when Kate and William were getting married, they showed us like their heritage from thousands of years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201c . . . Some of us can\u2019t even remember the Underground Railroad or Harriet Tubman. You can ask an adult today, what\u2019s the Underground Railroad? . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so convinced that our heritage is backward and we are ashamed of it and as a result, we have nothing to sell, and so we are consumers. And so like, just on hair alone, we spent $100 billion a year, and the men are wearing that hair vicariously. I believe that if you\u2019re a society that doesn\u2019t know where it comes from, you\u2019re a society that isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cHugh and I began discussing jump-starting his memoir project in 1995. He had piles of legal pad handwritten notes from an earlier effort with Quincy Troupe. It took nine years, but we got it done! \u2018Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela\u2019 was published by Crown in April 2004. Jacana Publishers released the South Africa edition in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe worked on the book everywhere...at his farm in South Africa, my house in South Africa, my townhouse in Oxford, MS, when I was teaching at Ole Miss, and in hotel rooms in New York in between his gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was in the 8th grade when I first heard \u2018Grazing in the Grass\u2019 in 1968. That\u2019s when his music began to influence me. I met Hugh 10 years later in 1978, when I was a photo intern at Jet [m]agazine in Chicago. I went to cover a concert of his with Herb Alpert. They were performing at the Park West Club on Chicago\u2019s north side.\n\n\u201cMy 1995 Howard University doctoral dissertation, which explored African American kinship ties with South Africans and the Anti-Apartheid Movement, laid the research groundwork for Still Grazing.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 video interview, Cheers said he was planning a photo book, \u201cHugh Masekela: An Illustrated Life,\u201d to be published in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was still in development with the picture book concept with Bra Hugh and his staff,\u201d Cheers messaged Tuesday. \u201cWe tabled those plans when his health challenges began taking a toll in 2016. I spent time with Masekela last August in South Africa. We communicated via text during the fall.\u201d\n\nThe legendary musician died in Johannesburg on Tuesday after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer.\n\nThe family said in a statement, \u201cWe will, in due course, release details of memorial and burial services. Hugh Masekela was someone who always engaged robustly with the press on musical and social and political issues. We laud the press for respecting his privacy through his convalescence and during this, our time of grief. . . . \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobin Denselow, the Guardian: Hugh Masekela obituary\n\nHugh Masekela official site\n\nObama-Farrakhan Photo Published for First Time\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was during a mid-2005 Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) meeting on Capitol Hill when award-winning journalist Askia Muhammad captured one of the most significant photos of his career,\u201d Hazel Trice Edney reported Saturday for her TriceEdneyWire.\n\n\n\n\u201cMuhammad had doggedly covered then Chicago Sen. Barack Obama since he \u2018first laid eyes on him\u2019 at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Now, here was the Senator in a warm conversation with constituent and fellow Chicagoan Minister Louis Farrakhan. As leader of the Nation of Islam, Farrakhan is another star in Black America, but one whose name is synonymous with controversy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasting no time, Muhammad snapped the news photo. But moments later, he faced a dilemma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cObama had already become the darling of national Democratic politics. And the scent of a presidential run was strong.\n\n\u201cMuhammad and others almost immediately realized that the public release of this photo could mean major trouble down the road. Mainly because of bigotry and fear-mongering, the public release of that photo could doom America\u2019s chances of electing Obama as its first black president.\n\n\u201cMuhammad had not even left the scene when he received a call and the photo was being summoned by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Muhammad ultimately surrendered the disk to Minister Farrakhan\u2019s chief of staff. And it remained one of America\u2019s best hidden secrets for the next 12 years. ...\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe kept a copy for himself, however.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, more than a decade later, the glowing photograph of now former President Barack Obama and Minister Louis Farrakhan has been published in a book by Muhammad to be released Jan. 31 - \u2018The Autobiography of Charles 67X\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlacks, Latinos Cite CNN for Objectivity on Cable\n\nBlacks and Hispanics choose CNN as the news source \u201cbelieved to be objective,\u201d while whites favored Fox News, according to a survey from the Gallup Organization and the Knight Foundation discussed Tuesday.\n\nThe pollsters asked respondents to choose among Fox News, CNN, NPR, local news (nonspecific), BBC, MSNBC, \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d NBC News, the New York Times and ABC News.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhites chose Fox News, 29 percent to 10 percent each for CNN and NPR; blacks picked CNN, 28 percent to 9 percent for MSNBC and 8 percent for local news (Fox garnered 6 percent). Hispanics chose CNN, 21 percent, with 14 percent for Fox News. The other outlets were 7 percent and under.\n\nThe findings came in an overall study that concluded, \u201cAmericans believe the news media have an important role to play in democracy, particularly in terms of informing the public, yet they do not believe the media are fulfilling that role.\u201d It also concluded, \u201cAmericans\u2019 perceptions of the news media are generally negative, and their perceptions of bias have grown considerably from a generation ago. A majority cannot name an objective news source.\u201d\n\nHowever, the survey found African Americans, and to some degree Hispanics, on the other side of these issues, with respondents identifying as Republicans and/or white taking the opposing position. Blacks, Hispanics and Democrats expressed more positive views of the news media than did whites, independents and Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CNN finding is surprising in that MSNBC released Nielsen ratings on Jan. 8 that showed MSNBC finishing 2017 as the No. 1 network for all of cable in African American viewership for prime time (Monday through Friday, 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.). \u201cMSNBC delivered 483,096 African-American viewers, ahead of CNN, VH1, ESPN, OWN, TNT and BET,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong other results, the report said, \u201ca majority of blacks, 55%, rely on TV or radio talk shows to stay up to date, compared with 42% of Hispanics, 40% of whites and 34% of Asians.\u201d\n\nThirty-four percent of blacks said they shared news stories online, compared with 32 percent of Hispanics, 30 percent of independents, 27 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 25 percent of whites. Fifty-seven percent of blacks felt that social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter played a positive role in the news environment, compared with 54 percent of Hispanics and 37 percent of whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe survey provided a backdrop for a two-hour program, \u201cAmericans & the Media: Sorting Fact from Fake News\u201d (transcript), Tuesday at the Washington Post, featuring journalists and media critics. In a discussion of the effect of Donald J. Trump on the press corps, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks said the term \u201cfake news\u201d is \u201cputting a target on our heads,\u201d repeating that she had received death threats.\n\nRyan spoke as news reports said that Brandon Griesemer, 19, of Novi, Mich., was arrested last week and now faces federal criminal charges following an FBI investigation alleging that he called CNN headquarters multiple times with threats to \u201cgun down\u201d employees of the network for producing \u201cfake news,\u201d as Allie Gross reported for the Detroit Free Press.\n\nPanelists such as Stephen F. Hayes, editor of the Weekly Standard, noted that Trump had elevated genuine \u201cfake news\u201d outlets - which traffic in conspiracy theories, by giving them access to White House press briefings. He cited Gateway Pundit as one such outfit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes also said that conservatives had complained for years about liberal bias in the media but were too often dismissed as \u201cthere they go again.\u201d Panelists faulted the blurring of lines between news and opinion and urged all news media to label clearly the differences. When Stephanie McCrummen of the Washington Post, a native of Alabama, went to interview residents to pursue the story of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s sexual misconduct, residents were surprised that she was there to listen and not assert her opinion, they said.\n\nTrump was portrayed as making his presidency a show, with Jay Rosen of New York University calling him a competing news organization.\n\nThe poll results were based on self-administered mail surveys with a random sample of 19,196 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. \u201cGallup oversampled households known to include harder-to-reach respondents, specifically blacks, Hispanics and young adults,\u201d the organization said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u2018Best Actor\u2019 Surprised by Lack of Black Reporters\n\n\u201cAfter the SAG Awards Jaleesa Lashay, a reporter from Blacktree TV, asked Sterling K.

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy. Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground.

Of course, Kool-Aid was an ingredient. It was \u201cKool-Aid wine,\u201d after all, not \u201cHi-C wine\u201d or bitch-ass \u201cSunny Delight wine.\u201d But I could never determine what else was in there.\n\nWas it coconut oil? Pimento beans? Avocados? Old Bay? Pancake mix? Vanilla extract? Chicken stock? Melted Now and Laters?\n\nThe composition of the Kool-Aid wine continued to confound me. Until one day when I was 10 or 11 and I happened to be hiding in a living room closet with a clear view to the kitchen. And I finally was able to see what my dad used to make this exquisite and sublime refreshment.\n\nTwo packets of grape Kool-Aid. And a lemon.\n\nThat\u2019s it. There was nothing special at all about the Kool-Aid wine. It was just regular-ass Kool-Aid with a Giant Eagle lemon squeezed into it. Although the mystery was solved, I had put so much thought and existential weight into the mythical and ethereal characteristics of this mystery ingredient that the anticlimactic-ness of my discovery made me cry. This was the day I became a man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, since then, life has also taught me that some mashups and collaborations work, and some don\u2019t.\n\nFor instance, last week I was in the mood for some lemonade but had no lemonade in the house. I did, however, have lemons and La Croix. So I decided to put both into the Ninja to see if I\u2019d be able to make some lemonade with a twist. And I did! Except the twist was, \u201cThis shit is fucking terrible and tastes like carbonated hot dog water.\u201d\n\nAnd, sometimes, like with my dad\u2019s Kool-Aid wine, the collaboration works.\n\nThe latter is true with the above painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice (Janet Jackson) and Lucky (Tupac) from the movie Poetic Justice. It shouldn\u2019t work. Especially since, when I first saw the painting, my initial thought was that this was a real-time rendering of how Justice and Lucky would look today, in 2018. It wasn\u2019t until the third or fourth viewing that I realized it was Michelle and Barack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich then made me realize that although I hadn\u2019t realized I needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life, I totally, absolutely, definitely needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life. And I only didn\u2019t know that I needed it because I didn\u2019t know it existed.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting, for 25 years now, for something to replace the metaphysical import of Kool-Aid wine.

Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

In The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s magnum opus of Dominican history, a character opines that the cruelty that Dominicans show one another is the aftermath of having been under the rule of a murderous, racist dictator for 31 years. \u201cTen million Trujillos is all we are,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the matter of Donald Trump, I am suggesting the reverse. Maybe each of us brought this fate on ourselves by being too much like Trump. Not specifically the pathological-liar, rich, white developer person from Queens, N.Y., whose father attended a Ku Klux Klan rally, but Donald Trump, a transhistorical spirit of Absolute Wrongness. And we need to extract whatever\u2019s inside us that could possibly resemble that.\n\n1. Don\u2019t surround yourself exclusively with the same type of person.\n\nAlmost any picture of Donald Trump in President Barack Obama\u2019s old office looks the same: a crowd of shockingly unattractive elderly white men, from King White Walker Pence to Paul Mush-My-Face Ryan, celebrating a lunch of the bones of your child. Sometimes there\u2019s a wraithlike white woman in there. This is not just judging a book by its cover; read about Rex Tillerson and Steven Mnuchin, for example. These guys (and one or two ladies) are really the same: grotesquely wealthy, vitamin D-deficient, cruel, thoughtless and incompetent except in the game of fleecing other humans and raping the earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s you. Perhaps you feel your friends and acquaintances are a rich, diverse stew of politically progressive strivers, primarily black and middle-class, a couple of nice whites, but also those two Asian-American friends, one Korean, the other Chinese. But how does your group look to those two friends, the two nonblack ones whose names your other friends keep confusing?\n\nThe un-Trump move here is to expand your horizons. Get to know a straight-up Marxist who can tell you what the U.S. did to Chile in the 1980s. Familiarize yourself with the worldview of black lesbian anarchists. Get to know your local purveyor of halal treats or one of the exceedingly dapper elderly Ethiopian gentlemen who convene outside your local coffee shop. Imagine yourself in the Oval Office surrounded by something like America\u2014not majority white, but a full range of different skin colors and hairstyles and different religious head coverings. And the next time one of your black friends confuses Jen with Kimberly, tell them that shit is racist.\n\n2. Familiarize yourself with the Constitution.\n\nSince it seems doubtful that your president has not read this particular law of the land, you seriously need to brush up. For example, did you know that our Constitution gives the executive branch the right to \u201cput sulky and unpatriotic blackes [sic] in the stocks on a public square of his choice\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut since Donald Trump seems largely unaware of his job description and is employing a just-do\u2013it-and-let-the-American Civil Liberties Union-come-after-me approach, it would behoove you to know the articles and certainly the amendments\u2014the First, 13th and 14th being of particular interest. And, oh yes, the 25th.\n\n3. Re-evaluate your relationship with reality television.\n\nIt is indisputable that reality television, the utterly mediocre The Apprentice, elevated Trump to the highest post in the most powerful country in the world. This must be addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan you at least level-down your watching? Yes, I know, Cardi B, but thanks to reality television, the United States is flirting with the idea of nuclear war. Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d can be the soundtrack to the postnuclear ashes of our society.\n\nAnd you might think about that while re-evaluating your relationship to Twitter, as well, since those digital screens are DT\u2019s direct line to your soul. The words of a revolutionary (if sexist) bard come to mind: \u201cYo, why don\u2019t you just back up from the Twitter, read a book or something? Read about yourself, learn your culture; you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n4. Stop eating burned steak.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that Donald Trump has in common with a noncrazy black person is that he does not enjoy a bloody steak. Intriguingly, eating charred-crisp steak is a key cultural practice among roughly the same group of Americans once likeliest to eat boiled pig intestines. Who can say why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would hazard that as marginalized people, we did not want to be reminded of the proximity of meat (edible) to cow (animated, brown-eyed). Also, while chitlins have fallen from favor in my generation (leaving los boricuas y los mexicanos to take up the charge with tripe), it bears mentioning that chitlins are, in fact, very well cooked.\n\nAt any rate, the black community can be seen anywhere from fancy French bistros to Outback insisting on filet mignon the consistency and color of hockey pucks. But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s preference, it must not be ours. If this is a problem, give up steak. That meat actually is a mammal with soulful eyes, and the American appetite for consuming cow is helping to heat up the climate and destroy human life. Wait, maybe I should have started there. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. Give up the steak already, damn.\n\n5. Don\u2019t be a bragging pussy grabber.\n\nMentioned if there is something you do analogous to grabbing women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it on the Access Hollywood bus. For example, the other day at the library with my sons, I overheard a security guard complaining to another about having to pay child support. The second guard (here I\u2019m paraphrasing but absolutely not lying) said, \u201cMan, I got so many women pregnant, but none of them ever came to me looking for anything like that. None of them!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you may want to point a long, Obama-like finger at that admittedly African-American man and mutter a racist platitude about broken family values. Or you might want to give a sociological lecture about the aftermath of slave-family structure and contemporary assaults on black male masculinity. But that was this guy\u2019s grabbing of women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it to Billy Bush. Everyone has their version. Don\u2019t do yours.\n\n\n\n6. Prepare for public speaking engagements.\n\nRemember when Charlie Sheen had a public breakdown that got him fired from his multimillion-dollar job and decided to go on a 20-city tour titled, \u201cMy Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option\u201d? He launched in Detroit, primarily yelling a nonsensical string of catchphrases, including \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cwinning.\u201d I would bet my next check that many people who paid for those tickets went on to enjoy the live performances of Candidate Cheeto. But unlike Candidate Cheeto, who became president, Sheen was rightfully booed off the stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheen\u2019s \u201ctour\u201d was the rehearsal for this hot hell right here. Trump rambles off the top belligerently at press conferences, when some poor overworked Nazi aide probably poured hours into a teleprompter script; he does it in front of the U.N.; he does it at white power campaign rallies (why is this orange individual having campaign rallies? I mean, Pence I could see ... ); he does it in front of piles of manila folders; he gets up in front of cameras feeding satellites throughout the galaxy. He says whatever ignorant shit occurs to him, and when members of his death cult cheer, he says more of it. He improvises; he scats. It\u2019s not jazz, though; it\u2019s acid for the eyes, ears and soul.\n\nAnd it is why you and I must prepare. Maybe not to speak to millions about the fate of their health care or jobs or very existence, but to give a presentation to our co-workers, to a speech at our houses of worship or for an oral presentation for class (as a professor, I really beseech you on this one; I\u2019ve died during countless oral presentations). Maybe don\u2019t do what I\u2019ve seen every person who \u201cwrote their own\u201d wedding vows do, which was very obviously make up some shit right there at the altar. Let\u2019s prepare, and rehearse and say it because Trump wouldn\u2019t do it, and because it\u2019s classy and it\u2019s right.\n\n7. Let President Obama go.\n\nI have actually found it surprising the degree to which Donald Trump\u2019s agenda consists of pinpointing actions taken by the previous president, poking at them with his tiny, graceless hands and leaving orange, dusty smears. This appears to be his only vision beyond looting the treasury and whipping up frenzied crowds of the very people who will be crushed to dust by his policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy counsel here is for those of us who can\u2019t get our mind off Obama for different reasons. Maybe you spent the last eight years saying, \u201cNigga didn\u2019t do nuthin but drone, deport and talk down to black men,\u201d and somehow the rise of Trump makes you even angrier about Obama\u2019s failings. Or maybe when things seem apocalyptic, you go to a special place in your mind where Barack and Michelle invite you to dinner and then put on Anita Baker\u2019s greatest hits, offer you a cordial and ask if you want to slip into something more comfortable.\n\nBut, most likely, you\u2019re hoping that man will save you. I know I am. You can keep crying neoliberalism and calling him a good Republican, but Obama is undeniable. He got elected with an African name and a black Chicago wife, and he managed to keep all those black people safe in the White House for eight years. Do you know how many people tried to jump that fence and make him stop inviting rappers up in there?\n\nThough I partake in many of the left\u2019s critiques of him, I can\u2019t help respecting him more since learning that his lean shoulder was all that was holding the door against the Purge we are living now. It makes me want him to full-on lead the opposition in Candidate Obama \u201908 mode, but more like a cross between Che Guevara, Malcolm X, Shirley Chisholm and Harriet Tubman\u2019s shotgun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he\u2019s done.\n\nHe\u2019s gone to a beautiful house in Kalorama, a Washington, D.C., neighborhood that is also home to Jared and Ivanka. He emerges every now and then to spit a few bars about health care, but mainly he saves his hot 16s for million-dollar speaking engagements with billion-dollar white people all around the world.\n\nThis is not a dis. He\u2019s commissioning the first black painters ever to do the presidential portraits, one of them the relatively unknown Amy Sherald. I know he loves us, but we\u2019re running on fumes here. Gil Scott-Heron once said there\u2019s no such thing as a superman. We have to save ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing makes us more like Donald Trump than being obsessed with Donald Trump, passing his name back and forth like a virus. Even if it feels like he is personally torturing you, you cannot let him continue to enjoy having achieved his lifelong goal of being this country\u2019s, and maybe the world\u2019s, most mesmerizing spectacle. This is a piss-poor show, and he\u2019s watching us watching it while doing a lot of diddling with little appendages.\n\nMore importantly, watching, clicking, losing sleep and fuming about this individual is not what will stop him (or the congressional Republicans goodlordamighty, whom I haven\u2019t even addressed here) from disastrously altering human history. But do you know what will stop him (and them)\u2014I mean, besides being less like Trump? Great.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.
