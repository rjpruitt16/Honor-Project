Cox (Getty Images)\n\nI probably watched less college basketball this year than I ever have. Actually, \u201cprobably\u201d is unnecessary. That is definitely true. For someone as obsessed with basketball as I am, this might seem odd. But I have a few perfectly rational reasons for this lack of viewership:\n\nThe second draft of my book is due soon, which means that some days I\u2019m working from 9:30 a.m.-ish to 5 p.m.-ish (on VSB stuff) and then from 9 p.m.-ish to 2 a.m.-ish (on book stuff).\n\nThe team that\u2019s usually my favorite to watch (the University of Pittsburgh) might have been the worst team in major Division I basketball this year.\n\nI\u2019m playing basketball three times a week now.\n\nMy nephew is the starting point guard for his high school team, and I\u2019ve been to several of his games.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve watched enough to have a general idea of who is good, and I know enough to know who the top NBA prospects are. So when I filled out my bracket this year, I went with Arizona\u2014the team that has the best NBA prospect (DeAndre Ayton) and three other players (Rawle Alkins, Dusan Ristic and maybe Allonzo Trier) who might be in the league.\n\nAnd then Arizona got blown the fuck out.\n\nUsually, when a lower seed beats a high seed that\u2019s thought to be a title contender, it\u2019s because the lower-seeded team shot the lights out. Or the higher-seeded team couldn\u2019t hit shit. Or maybe the game showed that the teams were actually a bit more equal than the seeds would suggest. But Buffalo beat Arizona like they were a No. 1 seed and Arizona was a 16. They didn\u2019t just beat them. They punked them. In the last five minutes of the game, Arizona just gave up. It was such a display that even though it ruined my bracket, I was rooting for Buffalo to run up the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the day after that\u2014and the day after Trae Young was knocked out, too\u2014I want everyone\u2019s brackets to be as fucked as mine is. I want UMBC to beat Virginia and Bucknell to spank Michigan State. I want Charleston to do the Charleston on y\u2019all\u2019s brackets\u2019 grills. I want to see Texas Southern and Trae Jefferson (my new favorite player in college basketball) in the championship game.\n\n(Also, if you have a minute, watch these clips of Jefferson in high school. You won\u2019t be disappointed.)\n\nBefore Arizona lost, I was normal and well-adjusted Damon. I was Damon with dreams and goals and a savings account. I was Damon who intentionally ate some kale yesterday because I knew I needed something green in my system. I was Damon who just really enjoyed a comfortable pair of socks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow I just want anarchy. I want all brackets busted.

Moreover, only a few weeks before the election, the Financial Times reported that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had spoken to media executives about launching Trump TV in the aftermath of the election. Around that same time, Sweet Potato Saddam claimed that he would accept the election results \u201cif I win.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, not only did he plan to be a sore loser of potentially historic proportions, but he also sought to join the ranks of Fox News and the Sinclair Broadcast Group and further soil our media climate with right-wing-slanted bullshit.\n\nAnd yet, when Hillary Clinton announced that she would be going on a book tour last month, almost instantaneously came reports that Democrats were \u201cdreading\u201d it. These reports were curious for a number of reasons:\n\nOne, there are Democratic senators like Claire McCaskill of Missouri following Hillary Clinton\u2019s path to losing an election by catering more to rural voters who don\u2019t give a solitary damn about Democrats than to the black voters whose support typically keeps the Democrats in power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith respect to failed presidential candidates like Sen. John McCain, who boasted in September to Politico that he never wrote a book about the 2008 presidential campaign, he never met a Sunday program that he didn\u2019t want to appear on\u2014which suggests that he wanted to continue courting attention, only by different means, after Barack Obama mollywhopped him at the polls.\n\nThere\u2019s also the reality that in the case of McCain, who this week lectured the masses about the current state of the political climate, he probably didn\u2019t want to address the fact that he gave us Sarah Palin, who helped pave the way for the very antics he now condemns.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, none of these people had this much to say when Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic presidential primary to Clinton, announced during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would be writing a book about his campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the case of Hillary Clinton, though, her critics have (presumably purposely) ignored the fact that even if she wanted to go away, as someone who has been a fixation of political discourse for decades, chances are that such a goal would be impossible.\n\nPeople found her in the woods, and it made headlines. People found her at the grocery store, and it made headlines. I didn\u2019t see a story about her making a liquor-store run, but I\u2019m sure if she got caught in front of a bulletproof glass window trying to score some chardonnay and tequila (I don\u2019t know what rich folks\u2019 liquor stores look like, so I went with my version of normal), it would make headlines.\n\nSo, a proposed self-imposed exile has always been nothing more than a fantasy for foolish minds. She couldn\u2019t get out of the spotlight if she wanted to. Why not let her do her book tour? People would be talking about her anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, white folks\u2019 president proved that in a series of tweets.\n\n\n\nFor the record, I do not want to see her name on a ballot again, and she has already made clear that she has no intention of ever running for public office again. Nevertheless, Real Estate Hitler would lose the election to Clinton if it were held on just about any day this year. The same can be said about the year after that, the one after that one and, likely, the next 17 after that, too.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of Fox & Fucking Fools and the de facto state TV network that produces it and, subsequently, 45\u2019s timeline, if you turn on Fox News at any given time of day, chances are you will see Clinton\u2019s name in the chyron.\n\nA glutton for punishment, I checked out the Fox News site and its YouTube page\u2014places I recommend no sane person go\u2014and \u201cbelieve me,\u201d there are several Clinton-centered segments to be found this week alone. Let them tell it, she colluded with Russia to purposely lose the presidential election and protected Harvey Weinstein because she planned to invade America and rename it the Clinton Foundation Nation. Or something like that.\n\n\n\nThat said, there was indeed a story circulating that claimed Clinton wished death on various \u201cFlorida hillbillies\u201d by way of Hurricane Irma\u2014which Politifact\u2019s Punditfact had to address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish we lived in a smarter nation, but as this year makes all too clear, we\u2019re not that fortunate. It doesn\u2019t help that there are millions of people who continue to foam at the mouth at any story that seeks to humiliate Clinton, despite the fact that she has already suffered the great humiliation of losing a presidential election to a walking, tweeting, burning cross.\n\n\n\nTo quote Mariah Carey quoting Mean Girls, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d\n\nWell, because Tangerine Mussolini and the real fake-news network need a villain, and Clinton remains a trusted one. As we inch closer to the 2020 election (God help us all), perhaps Fox News and the Colby-Jack F\u00fchrer will find a new enemy to stalk. I highly doubt it, but nonetheless, this is why some of us never joined the chorus calling on Clinton to go mute. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered because, whether anyone likes it or not, she will remain a fixture.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, who won the popular vote and faced unusual (to say the least) circumstances that contributed to her loss, has every right to tell her side of the story. I happen to have enjoyed What Happened because it\u2019s probably the most honest thing she\u2019s ever written.\n\nGranted, she still owes the world explanations for her actions in Haiti, Honduras and Libya, but as for addressing her presidential loss as the first female presidential nominee of a major political party, she has the right, as other loser candidates do, to talk her shit.\n\nHer book has nothing to do with the Democrats still not knowing what they are doing. If anything, I\u2019ve heard her discuss voter suppression more than any of the prospective 2020 candidates or present members of the Democratic leadership in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy comparison, so many Democrats have spent all year chasing after white voters who paid them dust in the last dozen elections, acting as if it was truly \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d that gave way to this moronic madman as commander in chief.\n\nObviously, Clinton doesn\u2019t care because she continues to make the media rounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, for every person who has wished her away, I want to extend to you the personal invitation to shut your silly self the hell up. No. 45 and Fox & Racist Thots are going to keep talking about her, as will Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. So will Rush Limbaugh. So will Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 clownish father, who needs his Twitter account burned alive at the stake. So will the Russian bots. As will anyone else aligned with the white-hood wearers running the White House into the ground.\n\nThe only thing I recommend that Hillary Clinton do is to talk about 45 the way she speaks about him when she\u2019s drunk at home with Bill Clinton, waiting to watch The Real Housewives of New York:\n\nTalk about his li\u2019l hands. Say he has a li\u2019l dick that probably hasn\u2019t been around Melania Trump since June 16, 2015. Sing Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cPiss on You\u201d video the next time you\u2019re on Maddow. Do whatever you can to further antagonize him the way he drives many of us insane day after goddamn day.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for those who have been vexed about Clinton\u2019s \u201cBitch, I Told You So\u201d tour: She is not the problem. They are and always have been.

At the time, I wrote that if I were Clinton and, by extension, former President Barack Obama, I would put the nation temporarily on \u201cdo not answer.\u201d\n\nAs I noted then specifically with respect to Clinton: \u201cWhile we are undeniably living in unique and increasingly dire circumstances, not only do I question the push for Clinton to more aggressively speak out against the antics of this amateurish administration, but I also worry about its ineffectiveness this early.\u201d\n\nWe already had a sore winner who was constantly invoking the election he won. We didn\u2019t need the person he defeated egging him on in the infancy of his presidency. Besides, typically, unless a defeated presidential candidate maintains public office, he or she is supposed to wait for whatever the political equivalent of Unsung is.\n\n\n\nHowever, now that we are more than 100 days into 45\u2019s first term\u2014which seems to be permanently set at basic bitch level\u2014not only is it the perfect time for Clinton to launch her \u201cBitch, I Told You So\u201d tour, but she should keep adding dates.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Clinton did an interview with CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour during a Women for Women International luncheon. While she acknowledged that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a perfect campaign\u201d and that she did make mistakes, she noted, \u201cI was on the way to winning until a few things happened.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few of those things would include Russian meddling in the election and, more pointedly, the controversial letter FBI Director James Comey released Oct. 28. Yes, Clinton is still wrong for not campaigning in the states Democrats didn\u2019t win, and of course, she was a fool not to rally enough of \u201cthe blacks,\u201d who usually save the Democrats asses. Nevertheless, analysis by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver shows that Comey\u2019s announcement that the FBI was reopening the investigation into her private email server affected her chances.\n\nOn Wednesday, Comey defended that action while speaking before the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut honestly, it wouldn\u2019t change the decision.\u201d I don\u2019t like wishing ill on people, but if Comey leaves the next seven Taco Tuesdays with problems for each Wednesday and Thursday thereafter, oh well. Why should we all suffer alone?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of, one of Orange Moon\u2019s greatest election-related insecurities is that he grossly lost the popular vote. \u201cI did win 3 million more votes than my opponent,\u201d Clinton recalled. When asked if her talking that cash-money shit would eventually draw a pointed response from 45 on Twitter, Clinton responded with, \u201cBetter that than interfering in foreign affairs.\u201d\n\nAnd like a moth to a flame burned by the fire, 45\u2014a deeply insecure, narcissistic, misogynistic asshole who still cannot handle being less popular than a girl\u2014took to Twitter to complain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen came an epiphany: Hillary Rodham Clinton should troll this stupid jackass until her very last breath.\n\nNow, there are some annoyances that will come with that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay, the incessant need of cable news networks to draw false equivalences for the sake of presenting a faux sense of balance. Clinton gave one interview, whereas 45 has consistently referenced her and the election since being sworn in. Then there is pedestrian pundits\u2019 habit of using Clinton\u2019s legitimate complaint about the lack of access to affordable high-speed internet in rural areas and how that impacts employment as an opportunity to call her elitist. Thankfully, there are much smarter people around to highlight the asininity in such assertions.\n\nThere are also folks who have responded to Clinton\u2019s resurgence by arguing that she should make another run for the presidency (fans and her haters alike). To quote Maya Wilkes, \u201cOh, hell no!\u201d It\u2019s not happening, y\u2019all. Let that go. She has.\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton did tell Amanpour, \u201cI\u2019m back to being an active citizen and part of the resistance.\u201d According to a report from Axios, that may include her launching a PAC as a way of \u201cacting as a quiet catalyst\u201d for supporting organizations related to the resistance, in addition to 2018 Democratic congressional candidates.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Orange Moon continues to be a clusterfuck of a president, Clinton\u2019s popularity will only grow. If she can use that to elect more Democrats, so be it. When Republicans in Congress propose to make sexual assault a pre-existing condition, when the president signs a law to assist religious zealots to bastardize dogma to perpetuate bigotry and when the attorney general won\u2019t prosecute law-enforcement officers who murder innocent black people, whoever can help should.\n\nBut on a smaller but still significant level, there is a delight in the idea of Clinton driving a crazy man crazier by speaking intelligently. Orange Moon never relents on sucking up all the space in the media zeitgeist, worsening our misery. Someone ought to give him what he doles out to us.\n\n\n\nShe should make it very plain that he is an incompetent nitwit in over his head. She ought to never stop talking about how much better she would have been as president. Granted, Baby Bop from Barney would have been a better president than the current one, but keep yapping anyway. Most of all, she should take the \u201cCan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop\u201d approach toward reminding that big bag of wet garbage that 3 million people voted for her over him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo it in the memoir about the election, the speaking engagements and whatever else may come.\n\n\n\nAnd if someone close to Hillary Clinton is reading this, might I suggest she continue wearing leather jackets while doing all of this?\n\n", "keywords": ["clintons", "45", "stop", "comey", "troll", "forever", "told", "democrats", "speaking", "election", "tour", "clinton", "hillary", "orange", "bitch", "president"], "polarity": 0.11441480206540446, "subjectivity": 0.48946930579460685},

So I'm saying it again (with some minor edits)***\n\nAs I type this, the remnants of a fried egg and bacon sandwich sits on a plate to my left. What was once a towering piece of sandwich art has been reduced to a dozen or so desolate crumbs and two lone strands of grated Parmesan cheese. If you squint, it looks like a map of Rhode Island.\n\nI live within a two mile radius of a supermarket and (at least) 20 different restaurants, and my refrigerator is (surprisingly) stocked. My food options are limitless. I chose to create and devour this sandwich because I had a very specific craving for the very specific combination of ingredients.\n\nI did not eat my fried egg and bacon sandwich and wish it were a Big Mac. Or a pizza. Or leftover roast beef. Or even a fried egg and sausage sandwich. I also did not attempt to make my fried egg and bacon sandwich taste more like a Big Mac, a pizza, leftover roast beef, or a fried egg and sausage sandwich. If I wanted any of those things, I would have eaten them.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m full. And happy.\n\nThe 2014-2015 NBA season started yesterday. I am very happy about this. Basketball isn\u2019t just my favorite sport. It is my favorite non-essential thing on Earth, and I enjoy watching NBA basketball more than I enjoy consuming any other type of media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not unique in my interest in NBA basketball. I am, though, (somewhat) unique in my love for and acceptance of its current form. NBA basketball is my fried egg and bacon sandwich. I do not want it to be a Big Mac.\n\nI realize this food analogy is ridiculous. But to understand the NBA\u2019s strange place in our cultural zeitgeist, ridiculousness seems appropriate. Necessary, even. To wit, by every conceivable metric (TV ratings, star quality, estimated sale price of teams, quality of play, transcendent beards, etc), the National Basketball Association is thriving. Yet, a very large percentage of people interested in the league\u2019s success and/or demise remain convinced there are cavernous, fundamental wrongs at the base of it's foundation. Basically, the league is fucked up and needs to be fixed.\n\nThis in itself isn\u2019t ridiculous, or even unwelcome. If everyone felt the exact same way about the exact same things, we\u2019d all work at Trader Joe\u2019s. What is ridiculous is that its perceived wrongs are only wrongs because it\u2019s being compared to three completely separate and completely ridiculous entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. An idealized version of an NBA past that never actually existed.\n\n2. A decidedly worse version of NBA basketball. (NCAA basketball)\n\n3. Walmart. (And, by \u201cWalmart\u201d I mean \u201cAmerica,\u201d and by \u201cAmerica\u201d I mean \u201cThe NFL\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, for those who believe the NBA has big problems, the NBA\u2019s biggest problems are 1. it\u2019s not something it never has been, 2. it\u2019s not a worse version of itself, and 3. it\u2019s not something it never will be.\n\nAnd this is why I love it.\n\nThorough explanations of why the idealized past never actually existed and why college basketball is inferior would venture into basketball wonk territory, and I\u2019ll spare you from that. Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, lets focus on Walmart.\n\nThe NFL has parity. Well, at least the perception of parity. I\u2019m not even sure if Kansas City fielded a team in 2012. I think they used their football stadium for monster truck rallies and Civil War reenactments every Sunday. But they had one of the NFL's best teams in 2013. They did not win the Super Bowl. But, their fans legitimately believed they have a chance. This is great. For the NFL.\n\nThe NBA does not have the same type of parity. The season has just begun, but those who follow the sport already know there are maybe five teams with a realistic shot of winning the NBA championship this year. Naturally, any conversation that brings up the NBA\u2019s place in the sports universe will cite the NFL\u2019s any-given-Sunday-ness as the reason for its popularity, implying that the NBA would be wise to try to emulate them. And, this is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unique nature of basketball means that a dominant player will have more opportunity to provide an impact on the outcome of the game. (As good as Peyton Manning is, he doesn\u2019t play defense, so he\u2019s only able to have an effect on half of the game. Lebron, on the other hand, can conceivably play every minute.) This makes it inherently less random, and the length of the NBA\u2019s schedule and the playoffs series format make it even less random. These dynamics combine to make the NBA the sports world\u2019s truest meritocracy\u2014which I love\u2014and asking it to be more random and more like the NFL is asking a fried egg and bacon sandwich to be a Big Mac.\n\nThere\u2019s also the argument that there are too many games. And this also is an argument that compares the NBA season to the NFL season. And this is also a ridiculous argument.\n\nWhile the common point of the argument\u2014less games means that each game matters more\u2014seems to make sense, it also implies that people who love football love it because there\u2019s less of it. Which sub-implies that people who love football don\u2019t actually love football. If you love something specifically because there isn\u2019t much of it, you don\u2019t really love it that much. You love waiting for it, looking forward to it, and craving it, but you don\u2019t love it itself. And, because I love watching NBA basketball so much, it doesn\u2019t matter much to me that the season is long and every game doesn\u2019t have the mythical import that a 16 game season might have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize the title is (somewhat) misleading. It outright says that the post will explain my love for NBA basketball, but the bulk of the post is devoted to one of the reasons why people who don\u2019t love it don\u2019t love it. This would seem to be a very insecure expression of love.\n\nBut all explanations of love eventually sound insecure. Not because the person in love is trying to convince themselves, but because any attempt to articulate and deconstruct love is going to fall short.\n\nBasically, I love NBA basketball because it\u2019s NBA basketball and not anything else. Which doesn\u2019t say anything.

Right?\n\nClinton is a fascinating study. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impeccable, but her untrustworthy ratings are impossibly high for a leading presidential candidate. She\u2019s a hard worker who\u2014as her longtime friend actress Mary Steenburgen said Thursday night\u2014will get knocked down seven times and stand up eight. She also comes across as a political animal, someone who clearly wants power, both because she has a distinct vision for America (and the world) and because she has a more than healthy ego. You kind of have to in order to believe that you should be \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she took her experience, credentials and work ethic and pulled together a workwoman\u2019s speech that took to task her rival while expanding on the hope and optimism\u2014the \u201cstronger together\u201d ethos \u2014that was the theme of this convention. That America is better united than divided, heavy on the implication that it is newbie GOP leader Donald Trump doing the dividing.\n\n\u201cHe wants to divide us\u2014from the rest of the world and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe's taken the Republican Party a long way \u2026 from \u2018morning in America\u2019 to \u2018midnight in America.\u2019 He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, a great Democratic president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: \u2018The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell, there is fear itself and fear of a Trump presidency, something that the Democrats were adamant about preventing. Delegates were verbally beaten about the head with the notion that the party must unite in order to defeat him in the fall or else Canada is going to face an influx of millions of new immigrants, if the internet is to be believed. (But packing up and skipping out on America is a bit harder than you\u2019d think. And considering that most Americans don\u2019t even have passports, it\u2019s more fantasy than anything.) Protest chants of \u201cNo more wars\u201d were drowned out by cries of \u201cUSA.\u201d Delegates who were distinctly \u201cBernie or bust\u201d announced that they were not \u201cwith her\u201d this fall. But \u201cfear of a Trump planet\u201d continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatcha gonna do when the Trump comes for you? The Dems asked. With him wanting to deport millions of immigrants, block Muslims from entry and make \u201cBlue lives matter\u201d trump (no pun intended) \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d and the odd fact that he\u2019s the presidential hopeful of choice for the Russians, the chaos candidate loomed over the convention.\n\nMaking history is fun.

It\u2019s not over, by a long shot.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people.

As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done.

As I am one of the world\u2019s leading scholars on the subject, Wypipology: The Essential Guide to Understanding White People, will be a semiserious satire dissecting my life\u2019s work in the uncharted field of Wypipology. I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["wrong", "white", "black", "say", "im", "alert", "face", "monique", "answer", "charlamagne", "women", "netflix", "spoiler", "donkey", "calling", "tha"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

You graciously accept the invite! And that is the story of how The Root became a media sponsor for the 13th annual Jazz in the Gardens Music Festival.\n\nAs the fastest-growing jazz and R&B festival in the United States, JITG, in Miami Gardens, Fla., is the kind of ticket you want to get your hands on. Before I go on, think about this: Miami Gardens is one of the few black-run cities in the United States. So you know this festival is a big, black deal.\n\nAnd listen, JITG keeps getting better, because they have a special \u201cI Love the \u201990s\u201d tribute planned with Salt-N-Pepa, Kid \u2019n Play, Trick Daddy and Biz Markie! I can hear my childhood screaming in glee now!\n\nNot only am I about to be swaying in the Miami heat (ha, see what I did there?) to the sweet sounds of Baker\u2019s acrobatic alto notes, but there\u2019ll also be a delicious spread of American and Caribbean cuisines and a chance to buy black with offerings of artwork, handbags, clothing and memorabilia. Ooh, I\u2019m about to spend all my hard-earned money!\n\nAnita Baker is a known recluse. She\u2019s not alone on the list of artists who prefer the spotlight only when onstage. We\u2019ve seen her \u201cdon\u2019t look at me\u201d behavior in others like Marvin Gaye, Sade, Lauryn Hill, Jazmine Sullivan and Bilal. Maybe it\u2019s a thing that artists do to make us want them more? Hey, it works! I want to see Baker so bad, I am willing to go directly from a very exhausting vacation (I realize how first world I sound) right into working this show. I\u2019ll do that for Anita Baker. I love her the way Andr\u00e9 3000 does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker has had the kind of career most R&B songstresses only dream of. She\u2019s been singing throughout four decades and boasts eight Grammys, four American Music Awards and seven Soul Train Music Awards. In 1994, Baker\u2019s Rhythm of Love album led a tour that basically slayed, and then she went \u201chome to recharge.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when life happened for the singer. She said in an interview that she was caring for her children, husband and two ailing (now late) parents: \u201cI put my family over my career for the last 10 years, and I didn\u2019t intend to, but it just happened that way, and as it started to happen, it was like, this feels right.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that, Ms. Baker! I\u2019m just glad she ultimately decided to hit us all with more performances. In January 2017, Baker announced on Twitter that she would be retiring by her 59th birthday later that year. But then, at the top of this year, she announced that she\u2019d be giving her loyal fans a farewell tour. And here we are. I hate to see her go, but I\u2019ll love watching her perform!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, Jazz in the Gardens is one big celebration of blackness in all its forms of artistic expression. I\u2019m beyond excited because I feel as if I am about to have a major spiritual moment in Miami Gardens.\n\nClick here for tickets.\n\n", "keywords": ["weekend", "seeing", "miami", "im", "love", "united", "anita", "yall", "music", "tour", "baker", "gardens", "jazz", "way"], "polarity": 0.17867365424430642, "subjectivity": 0.55527950310559},

As did the death of luminaries such as Dick Gregory and Maurice White. But for all their contributions in moving black culture forward, their statuses as legends were solidified prior to their passing. My fear is that Reggie Oss\u00e9, better known as Combat Jack, who at 48 years young succumbed to colon cancer months after announcing his diagnosis, was denied a similar fate.\n\nThe first time I met Combat Jack was in Anaheim, Calif., last October at Now Hear This, an annual festival in which popular podcasters meet their adoring fans and perform their shows live. Riding off the unexpected success of my own podcast, The Extraordinary Negroes, which debuted a few months prior, my black ass was there for one reason and one reason only: to convince him that my show belonged on his Loud Speakers Network.\n\nHome to Kid Fury and Crissle\u2019s inimitable wit, Charlamagne tha Contrarian\u2019s polarizing opinions, Taxstone\u2019s authenticity and Angela Rye\u2019s raised fist, the roster on the Loud Speakers Network (which Combat Jack co-owned) is rivaled only by the Golden State Warriors\u2014just knocking down 30-foot jumpers and dunking on niggas for no reason, scoreboard and feelings be damned.\n\nWith my VIP pass in tow, I crept into some lounge I had no business being in and introduced myself to the man who inspired me to launch my own show, Combat Jack. Since I\u2019m an avid listener of The Combat Jack Show, he was amazed by how effortlessly I could recall minute details. He blistered at N.O.R.E.\u2019s penchant for continually hounding him about a deal he botched as a young lawyer, schooled me on interviewing techniques, gushed over his favorite podcasting equipment and shared a sneak preview of his next endeavor, Mogul, which was released earlier this year to universal acclaim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazed that I was able to get this kind of one-on-one time with him, I told him how much of a profound impact he had on me and how he was directly responsible for my own show even existing. Before I knew it, nearly two hours had passed. And as much as I appreciated chopping it up on some barbershop shit, it was time to shoot my shot.\n\nI prattled off about how we tackle difficult subjects within our community but infuse humor in order to make them more digestible. How our show was exactly what his network was missing and how we fit a need. He was impressed at our list of guests. \u201cY\u2019all did that yourself?\u201d Yup.\n\nBut before I could stunt on Instagram and commemorate our new partnership with obnoxious selfies and imaginary bottles of Champagne, I heard three fateful words: \u201cHolla at Matt.\u201d Matt, of course, being the innocuous white guy who, thanks to no formal introduction courtesy of Combat Jack, had no idea I had just spent the last two hours talking to his boss. Matt would also be the one to kill my dreams of throwing on that Loud Speakers jersey by referring me to the contact form on their website. \u201cSubmit your show on there and we\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Ouch. Thanks, Matt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I was devastated, but in hindsight, I realized I wasn\u2019t heavy enough in the podcast game to just waltz up to Combat Jack and expect him to snatch up my show. Dejected, I remember walking back to my car afterward promising myself that the next time I saw him, he would know who the hell I was.\n\nOver the next nine months, I proceeded to bust my ass building momentum for my podcast. Our social media following skyrocketed to over 80,000 followers; we joined forces with the big homies Panama Jackson and Damon Young for a watch party in Washington, D.C., for BET\u2019s The New Edition Story; got shoutouts in numerous publications, including Bitch Media and the New York Times; got invited to SXSW to perform a live episode of our show; announced a partnership with streaming media juggernaut TuneIn; and got nominated for Best Society and Culture Podcast in the People\u2019s Choice Podcast Awards. A bunch of other accolades and opportunities fell into our laps as a direct result of our success. So when I heard that Combat Jack was returning to Los Angeles for BET Weekend in June to do another live show, I was ready this time.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before his show started, I ran into him inside the venue. Much to my surprise, he rolled up on me. \u201cYo, it\u2019s Jay, right?\u201d Wait, what? He must have me confused with somebody else. I started to remind him of how we met at Now Hear This, but he shut me down quick: \u201cYo, I wanna come on your show. I leave on Monday. Let\u2019s make it happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoa.\n\nKnowing how much he prided himself on preparing for his interviews (a trait I inherited from him) and realizing that him coming on to my show was essentially my audition for the Loud Speakers Network, I knew rushing to record that weekend was a terrible idea. Much to even my own surprise, I declined. Instead, I offered to bring him on in a few weeks. To which he replied, \u201cBet. No bullshit. I wanna come on. Y\u2019all moving out here.\u201d He snatched my phone out of my hand, plugged his number in, asked someone to get a picture of us, dapped me up, then dissolved into the crowd. Thankfully, Matt was nowhere to be found this time.\n\nAfter locking in his interview, I was so amped I took my ass straight home after his show and stayed up until 3 a.m. researching him on the internet. Over the course of the next few weeks, I called or texted various people who had personal relationships with him and dragged tidbits of information out of them to craft questions around. After an absurd amount of research and preparation, I was 100 percent confident I would deliver his best interview ever. But sadly, fate had other plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough we texted back and forth trying to lock in a date, his schedule was bananas. First it was Vegas, then it was family. Soon it was becoming painfully obvious that the opportunity to interview the man who single-handedly changed my life and so many others was diminishing. But our failure to lock in his interview doesn\u2019t upset me at all. It\u2019s the fact that I never had the opportunity to thank him.\n\nSimply put, in launching the Loud Speakers Network, Combat Jack provided so many of us with a voice. In a world consumed with diluting, disparaging and disposing of any semblance of blackness, he created a platform for us to be our unapologetic selves. And while he wasn\u2019t the first black podcaster, he was easily the most influential. You can literally pinpoint the trajectory of podcasting before and after the birth of the Loud Speakers Network.\n\nIn fact, if you eliminate his contributions and influence, many of your favorite comedians, entertainers and media personalities wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. That\u2019s a fact. The argument can even be made that SoundCloud is only being kept afloat because podcasters funnel so much money into it. Though SoundCloud is widely maligned in podcasting circles, an overwhelming majority of podcasters of color host their own shows on the platform anyway in order to emulate Loud Speakers Network\u2019s formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for creatives such as myself, he provided us with far more than just a voice. He gave us our calling. After moving to Los Angeles in 2014 to jump-start my own writing career, I quickly realized that instead of pounding the pavement to work my way up the food chain, the fastest way to reel in the writing opportunities I wanted was to leverage my personality into popularity.\n\nAs such, podcasting has allowed me to reach millions of people I otherwise never would. It\u2019s allowed me to travel the country and generate awareness around important issues such as mental health in the black community, social justice and the pervasiveness of toxic masculinity. It\u2019s allowed me to change lives, speak in schools and on panels, and celebrate the agency and accomplishments of people of color. Podcasting has provided me with invaluable relationships and has opened countless doors that would otherwise have remained closed. In short, podcasting has given me\u2014and countless others\u2014purpose.\n\nAnd that\u2019s solely because of Combat Jack.\n\nHis death teaches us not only that one man has the power to move mountains but also why it\u2019s important that we champion our heroes while they\u2019re still here to move them.

But he\u2019s also all about making sure he represents his city.\n\nGilbert serves as the president of the Dade League of Cities, he\u2019s on the board of the National League of Cities, he\u2019s on the advisory board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and he\u2019s the incoming president of the African-American Mayors Association.\n\nHe\u2019s proud to be the voice that represents the 113,000 people who live in his city. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up there who has the privilege of being the mayor of his hometown,\u201d Gilbert said, referencing his loyalty to home.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people know Miami proper, especially South Beach, but there\u2019s more to Miami than tanned skin and toned physiques. There\u2019s plenty of culture. In fact, the mayor wears yet another hat: He\u2019s the executive producer of Jazz in the Gardens, a premier event featuring shows from a few of your favorite artists: Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, Fantasia, Joe, Smokey Robinson and more.\n\n\n\nThis event marks 12 years of culture and art through many genres, including soul, jazz and R&B. It\u2019s no wonder that an event like this is held in a city like Miami Gardens. This city is the largest black city in Florida and one of the largest black cities in the country.\n\n\n\nMayor Gilbert\u2019s goal is to build places where people can live, work and play. In addition to the Jazz in the Gardens show, there are many other reasons why you should consider visiting one of the the blackest cities in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: What\u2019s the importance of being the mayor of a black-run city?\n\nOliver Gilbert: Hope built this city. Hope is undefeated. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re not just exceptional as a black city, we\u2019re exceptional as any city. We\u2019ve doubled the number of people who are opening businesses in the city every year that I\u2019ve been mayor.\n\nThere are stereotypes and preconceived notions that you can\u2019t do it right. We\u2019ve increased our bond rating, increased our reserves. We dedicated $60 million to transforming public space so that kids can learn science, technology, engineering, mathematics, culinary arts, recording studios and television production.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, what government is is our agreement with each other that we\u2019re going to live in a certain place, in a certain way. What our laws and what our budget should reflect are what our values are. So our values are making it better for our kids, make creating a better place for them. Enlarging their imagination, empowering them to dream bigger dreams and go further.\n\nTR: What makes you a unique mayor?\n\nOG: I have the best city in the country because I know who we were, who we are and who we can be. People talk about police officers\u2014I\u2019m going to take young kids from this community and put them in police academy. I\u2019m going to show you what community policing looks like. They said it was impossible. Now we\u2019re on our fourth plan. So, look, when they say it can\u2019t be done, what I say is \u201cOK\u201d and I go to work. I believe that anything\u2019s possible. That\u2019s what history\u2019s shown me. Anything is possible if you\u2019re willing to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me more about Jazz in the Gardens.\n\nOG: It was literally a parking lot. We changed a parking lot into something extraordinary, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re dedicated to it. We show that same dedication to our kids and to our government services. We understand that the city is one thing, a community is something else. So, I\u2019m the mayor of a city, but I\u2019m helping to build a community.\n\nWe have a lot of entertainment, but what\u2019s going on on the stage is just a little bit of it. What\u2019s going on in that audience is people connecting; it\u2019s the creation of a feeling that you will remember that will bring you back to my hometown, Miami Gardens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What can you say about people who perceive Miami in a negative way?\n\nOG: The bad headline isn\u2019t actually the story. You might have something violent that happened that\u2019s the headline, but the story are the kids that are winning chess championships, the coding classes that are going on, the overemphasis on arts, the kids from Moonlight. The story is the fact that last year, we had Flo-Rida and Rick Ross, who are both from Miami Gardens as No. 1-No. 2 in sales in the world. That\u2019s the story!\n\nTR: As a black public official, what are your words of encouragement to those who have no hope in light of this administration?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOG: I don\u2019t care about a president who is on Twitter. We survived more than that. I know what we have done, so I know what we can do. This is for that student and every other person who looks at the news and is pessimistic about our future. And inheritance of hope is an indelible part of the American evolution. Because without hope, independence remains a colony. Slaves remain in servitude. The franchise is never female. Civil rights are always criminal. Education is never public. And labor happens without reward, without hope. And the White House is forever a White House.\n\n\n\nThat hope still lives in us. It is not lost to hate or division or fear or [fearmongers]. It is forever the dawn. I believe that. That belief is not born from a naive belief in the internal, it rises from what history was and what we are. I\u2019m looking at what hope has done as an indicator of what hope can do. Hope has changed the world. So hope can change the world. Hope is forever. We should all remain vigilant.\n\n\n\nTR: And why should people come to Jazz in the Gardens?\n\nOG: We want to bring you to Miami Gardens. We\u2019re going to keep your attention with who we are.

But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

From helping to launch the careers of Sheila E., Vanity, Apollonia 6 and the Time to serving as an inspiration to generations of artists\u2014including the Weeknd, D\u2019Angelo, Frank Ocean, Beyonc\u00e9, Pharrell, etc., etc., etc.\u2014Prince left an indelible mark on music that will probably never be equaled (and by \u201cprobably\u201d I mean \u201cdefinitely,\u201d which, again, if you disagree, be prepared to catch these hands).\n\nBecause his genius was so far-reaching, here are eight songs you probably didn\u2019t know were influenced, written by or just blessed by Prince\u2019s mere presence.\n\n\n\n1. \u201cStand Back,\u201d Stevie Nicks\n\nThe way Stevie Nicks tells it, she began writing \u201cStand Back\u201d after hearing \u201cLittle Red Corvette\u201d while on her honeymoon. She spent most of the night penning the song while humming the greatest single ever about a one-night stand. Later, Nicks called Prince because she wanted to confess to him that she had \u201ckinda ripped off his song.\u201d Prince being Prince, he showed up at her place, sprinkled his purple magic all over her synthesizers for about 25 minutes and then left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe spoiled me for every band I\u2019ve ever had because nobody can exactly re-create\u2014not even with two piano players\u2014what Prince did all by his little self,\u201d Nicks told music journalist Timothy White in 1991. Prince\u2019s contribution is uncredited, but the two superstars did agree to split the royalties 50-50, because even musical geniuses can\u2019t live off of high praise and thank-you notes.\n\n\n\n2. \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d Madonna\n\nLike a Prayer, the album, actually features a duet between the Queen of Pop and the Purple One called \u201cLove Song.\u201d But Prince also laid down some guitar tracks while in the studio. According to Madonna producer Patrick Leonard, the guitar distortions heard at the beginning of an extended version of \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d were played by Prince. That version isn\u2019t heard on the album, but it can be heard in the controversial video that got Pepsi in a lot of trouble, and which shows that the soda giant has been making bad choices involving privileged white women for quite some time now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cYou\u2019re My Love,\u201d Kenny Rogers\n\nPrince wrote songs for many artists across all genres, and since country music is black music\u2014despite what fans of the Country Music Awards might think\u2014it isn\u2019t too surprising that he wrote a track for country superstar Kenny Rogers. Using the pen name \u201cJoey Coco,\u201d Prince wrote the 1986 ballad after Rogers contacted him through a mutual friend about getting Prince to write him a song.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cManic Monday,\u201d the Bangles\n\nPrince did love him some pen names, and this hit single was credited to \u201cChristopher,\u201d as in Christopher Tracy, his character from Under a Cherry Moon. The track was initially intended for Apollonia 6, but Prince sent the song to the Bangles, reportedly because he had a thing for Bangles guitarist-vocalist Susanna Hoffs. It would become the band\u2019s first big hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d Sheena Easton\n\nBefore Prince got ahold of her, Sheena Easton was singing sugary pop tunes about morning trains and being a modern girl. After Prince, she was singing a different tune \u2014specifically, the sexually suggestive \u201cSugar Walls,\u201d which ended up being listed on the \u201cFilthy 15\u201d\u2014the songs with the raunchiest, most violent or drug-fueled lyrics, according to Tipper Gore\u2019s Parents Music Resource Center, the force behind the \u201cparental advisory\u201d sticker. The Filthy 15 also featured another sexually explicit song by Prince that drove Gore to create the PMRC in the first place. Easton would later join Prince on another track, \u201cU Got the Look,\u201d from 1987\u2019s Sign o\u2019 the Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cI Feel for You,\u201d Chaka Khan\n\nPrince wrote this classic R&B hit for Patrice Rushen, who rejected the track along with \u201cI Wanna Be Your Lover\u201d (I wonder how Rushen, who had a decent career, feels now about not jumping on the Prince bandwagon when she had the chance?), so he included the song on his 1979 self-titled album. In 1984, Chaka Khan released an album of the same name and, in a rare feat, produced a song that outshone the origin. Of course, Chaka did have a little help from legendary rapper Melle Mel, who dropped that catchy little verse on the opening of the track, which perfectly took advantage of the growing rise of hip-hop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cHow Come You Don\u2019t Call Me,\u201d Alicia Keys\n\nHere again is another example of a female singer taking a Prince tune and turning it into a hit (of course, the most famous example of this is Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s cover of \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d). Based on Prince\u2019s \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me Anymore?,\u201d which first appeared on a compilation album in 1993, Key\u2019s single appeared on her debut album, Songs in A Minor, in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cWhen You Were Mine,\u201d Cyndi Lauper\n\nThis Prince-penned song appeared on Lauper\u2019s debut album, 1983\u2019s She So Unusual. Lauper, who, like Prince, had a unique musical persona that confounded and defied expectations, was a longtime friend of the Royal One, who gave her business advice back in the day when they were stars coming up in the \u201980s; he even secretly attended her concerts.", "keywords": ["touched", "princes", "track", "probably", "wrote", "music", "album", "stand", "single", "songs", "know", "song", "little", "didnt", "magic", "prince"], "polarity": 0.09200669700669702, "subjectivity": 0.47079161579161594},

One night at dinner, I asked one of my colleagues why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here in a restaurant that you couldn\u2019t eat at when you were 16 years old because of apartheid. That\u2019s not ancient history. That\u2019s high school. Doesn\u2019t that make you angry still?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe last \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign was probably taken down 10 years before I was born\u2014but black Americans are still pissed about racism, past and ongoing.\u201d\n\nShe considered my question for a minute, probably thinking of a way to explain a lot of complicated history to an American outsider.\n\n\u201cWell, we got our country back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re home; it\u2019s our land. You fought and you\u2019re still in a place that doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThat simple conversation explains a lot about the current social media flap about conservative host Tomi Lahren, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and radio personality Charlamagne tha God from The Breakfast Club. Sometimes our legitimate black anger doesn\u2019t let us see what\u2019s going on and blinds us to how blacks in the Diaspora view American race relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trevor Noah interviewed the Blaze\u2019s Tomi Lahren last week, no one predicted that it would create so many trending hot takes. Objectively, Noah\u2019s interview with Lahren was pretty good. Many of his longtime, mostly white, media critics turned away from their Jon Stewart memorial shrines long enough to praise Noah for coming into his own. Many black pundits and Twitterati did drive-by analyses of the interview after it went viral (because let\u2019s be honest; The Daily Show audience doesn\u2019t boast a regular large black viewership). The general consensus was either 1) Noah let Lahren off too easy or 2) he never should\u2019ve given her bigoted views a platform to begin with.\n\nSome of this early criticism by black Twitter wasn\u2019t exactly fair, since, unless you\u2019re a fan of his work, judging Trevor Noah\u2019s comedy and progressive chops by his one interview with Tomi Lahren is akin to judging Dave Chappelle by his \u201cGive Trump a chance\u201d monologue on Saturday Night Live and ignoring anything else he\u2019s done in comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, when Charlamagne tha God, faux woke comedian and professional troll from the radio show The Breakfast Club, was caught playing Instagram footsie angling for an interview with Lauren, black Twitter called the Drop Squad. Suddenly Charlamagne, and Noah, were sellouts, seduced by a White She-Devil and unwittingly giving a platform to increasingly bold white supremacists in this post-Trump America.\n\nTrevor Noah, relatively new to this game, is being dragged by Twitter for something he never did.\n\nI am a huge fan of Noah\u2019s brand of political humor and have been ever since I saw the documentary about his life, You Laugh but It\u2019s True, at a film festival in 2012. Since he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his critics have accused him of, basically, not being Jon Stewart. Trevor Noah doesn\u2019t embody the East Coast white liberal outrage that other Daily Show alums like John Oliver and Samantha Bee have honed with laserlike efficiency. For black folks wanting searing racial political humor, Larry Wilmore was on Comedy Central for a year picking up the slack. Noah didn\u2019t have the burden of being both black and white America\u2019s political-comedy catharsis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of that is different now with the election of white-nationalist-sympathizing Donald Trump. Black people are legitimately scared. In this age of creeping white nationalism, if a liberal host (especially a black one) has a conservative guest, anything short of a gladiator-style verbal evisceration, followed by a slow thumbs-down and a tossing of bloody rhetorical entrails to the audience for sport, is tantamount to collusion with the enemy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Trevor Noah\u2019s style, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. He\u2019s more Yakov Smirnoff than Paul Mooney. He\u2019s an outsider more bemused than enraged by our politics.\n\nIf there is any criticism I have of Noah in the wake of this fake controversy, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend enough time sharing how his worldview differs from the audience's. His best comedy is when he flips our flawed democracy into typical politics throughout Africa. As a child, he lived through apartheid, which was like the Batman of white supremacy; it took the best parts of racism from around the world and perfected it \u2026 at the expense of 85 percent of the population for 70 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because Noah\u2019s comedy is more driven by the philosophy of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee than our Western notions of getting revenge and getting even doesn\u2019t make him soft on bigotry. Treating Lahren nicely after his show is no worse a crime than my South African colleagues tipping a white waiter in a restaurant that used to not serve blacks. Sometimes you show power by not letting bigots dictate your behavior.\n\nOver the next four (likely eight) years, there will be plenty of white-nationalist-sympathizing conservatives out there, and plenty of black media people who will try to suck up to them. Charlamagne tha God is a professional provocateur who thought he\u2019d get some clicks and some good trolling out of dangling a \u201cpretty white girl\u201d in front of his mostly black audience. But even he realized that he was playing himself.\n\nNoah, who perforated Lahren\u2019s bigotry for 20 minutes, shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire of shade bullets aimed at Charlamagne. He\u2019s bringing good comedy and satire from a perspective that could do us some good in these coming trying times. Perhaps next time, black Twitter should listen to more than his comedy highlights before burying him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

Or just a conservative. Or capital letter White. Or even very problematic.\n\nNo, she is an abjectly awful person. She says abhorrent and hateful things, and has leveraged this abhorrence and hate to give herself a larger platform to infect more people with it and make more money off of it. She is willfully and dangerously ignorant, is either unaware of or unconcerned with historical context, and also seems to have no problem inciting violence against people protesting and brutalized by it. If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne. Look how fun she looks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when we allow that to happen, we're not brave. We're not sober. We're not attempting to find a common ground. We're not extending an olive branch.

Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["justice", "black", "joe", "parish", "help", "white", "woman", "jury", "jefferson", "gasser", "shooting", "player", "juror", "nfl", "mcknight"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547}
