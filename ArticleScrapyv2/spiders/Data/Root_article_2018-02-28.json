The technology, implemented after New Orleans\u2019 murder rate was the highest in the nation, traces so-called criminals\u2019 ties to other gang members, analyzes their social media, and outlines and predicts the likelihood that individuals might commit violence or become a victim.\n\nAlthough there are similar programs in other American cities, what makes this partnership especially egregious is that no onenot the defense attorneys defending alleged gang members who were tracked by this software, nor the New Orleans City Council, nor the public\u2014knew that it was being used.\n\nAnd on top of that, Palantir is a data-mining firm founded with seed money from the CIA\u2019s venture capital fund.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2004, the company was co-founded by racist colonizer and venture capitalist Peter Thiel (also the company\u2019s single-largest shareholder), who has raked in millions of dollars with Palantir through contracts with the Pentagon and United States intelligence services, as well as foreign security services.\n\n\n\nThe Verge reports that Palantir\u2019s partnership with the notorious NOPD (which itself has had serious issues around civil rights abuses) has been extended three times, with the third extension scheduled to expire Feb. 21, 2018. No one will confirm if it has been extended again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program escaped public notice, according to the Verge, \u201cpartly because Palantir established it as a philanthropic relationship with the city through Mayor Mitch Landrieu\u2019s signature NOLA for Life program. Thanks to its philanthropic status, as well as New Orleans\u2019 \u2018strong mayor\u2019 model of government, the agreement never passed through a public procurement process.\u201d\n\n\n\nPredictive policing technology is already controversial in that many believe it\u2019s just another way to implement racial profiling. Given that the city of New Orleans is 60 percent black, and that poor, black communities there bear the brunt of over-policing, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to guess who this flawed system will be used against.\n\nAccording to Florida Tech, other issues with predictive technology include the obvious threat to privacy, over-reliance on technology and lack of context when making claims against defendants (i.e., just because someone has a Facebook relationship with an alleged gang member doesn\u2019t make that person a gang member, too).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Verge says that there are even some concerns within the law enforcement community itself because five years after it was started in New Orleans, the company has sold at least one crime-forecasting system to foreign intelligence services for predicting the likelihood of individuals to commit terrorism and yet this system is being used in these United States against its own (black) citizens.\n\n\u201cPalantir is a great example of an absolutely ridiculous amount of money spent on a tech tool that may have some application,\u201d a former officer told the Verge anonymously. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not the right tool for local and state law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot only that, given the NOPD\u2019s documented abuses around biased policing and racial profiling, inadequate training and supervision, and failure to engage in community-oriented policing (they can now just sit behind a desk and find all the so-called \u201cbad guys\u201d), this is without a doubt a threat to the black community of Crescent City\u2014who had no idea it was even being used against them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the end of the article notes, \u201cIf Palantir\u2019s partnership with New Orleans had been public, the issues of legality, transparency, and propriety could have been hashed out in a public forum during an informed discussion with legislators, law enforcement, the company, and the public.

Currently, no people of color sit on Facebook\u2019s board.\n\n\n\nThe commitment came during Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s visit to Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, as The Hill reports.\n\nThe CBC pressed her on the company\u2019s lack of diversity.\n\n\u201cWe got a commitment today from Ms. Sandberg that an African American will be appointed to the board of directors in the future,\u201d said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), who was in the meeting, according to The Hill.\n\nFacebook\u2019s all-white board consists mostly of Silicon Valley\u2019s top players, nearly all of whom are men. On the 10-person board, only two members are women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn essence, the board of the most powerful social media platform in the world is not far off from the room of 12 white, blond men that Apple\u2019s diversity officer, Denise Young Smith, claimed could be \u201cdiverse.\u201d\n\nCurrently sitting on the board are Sandberg, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen, businessman Erskine Bowles, Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum and PayPal co-founder\u2014and staunch Donald Trump fanboy\u2014Peter Thiel, Mashable reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThiel\u2019s continued presence on the board is disturbing. Like the president he supports, Thiel has openly declared war on the free press. As Sidney Fussell at Gizmodo points out, the conservative billionaire and Silicon Valley goon is apparently Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cdiversity\u201d pick.\n\nFacebook\u2019s diversity numbers, like much of Silicon Valley\u2019s, are paltry. Not only does the company have no board members of color, but Facebook has not a single black executive. As Quartz reports, black workers make up only 3 percent of Facebook\u2019s total workforce\u2014despite data that shows black people are among the heaviest users of the social media platform.\n\nBlack lawmakers also pressed Sandberg on the social media platform\u2019s role in spreading racist messages, Mashable points out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company, currently valued at more than $500 billion, has come under scrutiny for its connections to Russian accounts during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Numerous outlets have reported that some ads purchased by Russian accounts stoked fear and disinformation about Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that weeks after Trump was elected, then-President Barack Obama personally warned Zuckerberg to take the spread of fake news and political disinformation on the social media platform seriously.\n\nNo deadline for the hire of an African American was given. Sandberg instead promised the CBC that a black board member would be brought on \u201cin the foreseeable future.\u201d", "keywords": ["finally", "allwhite", "members", "silicon", "promises", "member", "facebook", "pressed", "media", "ceo", "board", "add", "sandberg", "social", "black"], "polarity": 0.015380952380952386, "subjectivity": 0.4152857142857143},

As always, the winning side gets to choose its own all-star team, and after the new president-elect took his celebratory victory lap, Donald J. Trump began selecting his most valued players to fill out the roster for his administration.\n\nThis all-star team reflects the values and ambitions of the side (the American Wyte Pee-pull) whose comeback win ended an eight-year absence as champions. Although they dominated in 43 prior elections, they were long shots against their hated rival, Hillary Clinton, who\u2014like the last Democratic champion and all athletic organizations\u2014thought the black players on her team would carry her to victory. Instead, Republicans revised their game plan and brought the trophy back to white America.\n\nNow they get to reward the players who helped them with political power, Cabinet positions and leadership roles. Not since the Emmett Till jury has America seen a collection of talent this antagonistic and completely bigoted. Let\u2019s take a look at President-elect Trump\u2019s Hate All-Stars who will lead this country for the next four years.\n\n\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPosition: Chief political strategist\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nTook the alternative right, or alt-right, from a disparate collection of conservatives, neo-Nazis and skinheads and transformed them into a mainstream movement.\n\nFor four years, headed Breitbart, the favorite media outlet of white nationalism.\n\nHas zero years political and government experience.\n\nAs the quarterback of the team, Bannon\u2019s credentials as the Svengali of the alt-right are unquestioned. Aside from guiding a p\u2014sy-grabbing reality star to the position of leader of the free world, Bannon is credited with piloting his previous organization from obscurity to America\u2019s leading voice of racism and hate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also made self-described \u201csupervillain\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos a paid senior editor of Breitbart. This is the same Milo Yiannopoulos who is notorious for harassing Leslie Jones and setting a record for being so racist, he was kicked off Twitter (yes, apparently, there is at least one person too racist for Twitter). Bannon\u2019s ex-wife also swore in court that he told her he didn\u2019t want his children going to school \u201cwith Jews.\u201d\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the platform for the alt-right. \u2026 Are there racist people involved in the alt-right? Absolutely. Look, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe. Are there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes \u2026 \u201d\u2014Steve Bannon, July 2016\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nPosition: Rumored as secretary of state or Homeland Security chief\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nOne of the real OGs of the \u201cgang of hate,\u201d Giuliani brings a veteran presence and provides a racism r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that would make Bull Connor blush with envy. As the architect of the unconstitutional stop and frisk, Giuliani is notorious for codifying the policy that told police to disproportionately harass blacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is an ardent defender of law enforcement and blames all police killings on black people (namely black fathers), and once stated, \u201cThe white police officers wouldn\u2019t be there if you weren\u2019t killing each other.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Giuliani\u2019s most egregious trespass against the black community came after Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards performance, when he said he had \u201csaved more black lives than Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nObviously, the man has never listened to Lemonade.\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cBe very careful of those kids in the neighborhood and don\u2019t get involved with them because, son, there\u2019s a 99 percent chance they\u2019re going to kill you, not the police.\u201d \u2014Rudy Giuliani, July 2016\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Pence\n\nPosition: Vice president\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nIs one of the few people called a racist by a federal court.\n\nWanted to use funds for HIV prevention to \"convert\" gays into becoming straight.\n\nOpposed a law against hate crimes.\n\nSigned a bill to jail same-sex couples who wanted to get married.\n\nMike Pence looks like the country club president who was the villain in every \u201980s movie, and he governs like he\u2019s still living in the \u201980s\u2014the 1880s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no other governor has antagonized the LGBT community as much as Pence has. Pence came into prominence among conservatives when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, making it legal to discriminate against anyone by simply citing one's religious beliefs.\n\nA judge called his efforts to keep refugees from settling in his state the \u201cequivalent of his saying \u2026 that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them.\u201d\n\nPence also thinks there is too much talk of police racism and believes that homosexuality will be the end of America\u2019s greatness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow ironic.\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cHomosexuals are not as a group able-bodied. They are known to carry extremely high rates of disease brought on because of the nature of their sexual practices and the promiscuity which is a hallmark of their lifestyle.\u201d \u2014Mike Pence, 1993\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions\n\nPosition: Attorney general\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica goes from Eric Holder, who sued the city of Ferguson, Mo., for systematic racism, to Loretta Lynch, who charged Dylan Roof with a federal hate crime, to Jeff Sessions.\n\nJeff Sessions is from Alabama. I could stop there, but his career racism stats are too impressive to gloss over lightly. Sessions is so bold that he regularly appears at public events for white nationalist groups, and as one of the country\u2019s leading anti-immigrant voices, he originated the idea of the border wall. Ronald Reagan tried to appoint him to a federal judgeship, but he was rejected when senators found out that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a \u201cdisgrace to his race\u201d and called a fellow black prosecutor \u201cboy.\u201d\n\nYou read that correctly. Sessions was too racist for the Reagan administration. Just in case you were wondering how great America is being made\u2014apparently the \u201cagain\u201d part was the key.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cBe careful what you say to white folks.\u201d \u2014Jeff Sessions to Thomas Figures, a black assistant U.S. attorney\n\n\n\nPeter Thiel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPosition: Possibly secretary of commerce\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nHates the fact that women were given the right to vote.\n\nDonated $1 million to anti-immigrant group NumbersUSA.\n\nWas sued by the U.S. government for discrimination.\n\nIf Milo Yiannopoulos is the alt-right team\u2019s poster boy, then Peter Thiel is its Ken doll. He is relatively young, insanely rich (he co-founded PayPal and was the first outside investor in Facebook) and is a little bit racist. We mean \u201ca little bit racist\u201d in the same way that Hitler was a \u201ca little bit anti-Semitic.\u201d Thiel recently spoke to the Property and Freedom Society, which regularly provides a platform for white nationalists, and two of his friends recently spoke about his repeated defense of apartheid in South Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis racist evil genius currently heads a multibillion-dollar data-mining company, ensuring that one day, Thiel will actually become Lex Luthor.\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women\u2014two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians\u2014have rendered the notion of \u201ccapitalist democracy\u201d into an oxymoron.\u201d \u2014Peter Thiel, April 2009\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKris Kobach\n\nPosition: Possibly secretary of state\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nWrote Arizona\u2019s \u201cPapers, please\u201d law.\n\nWrote Alabama\u2019s \u201cPapers, please\u201d law.\n\nWrote Mississippi\u2019s \u201cPapers, please\u201d law.\n\nWas called \u201cthe most racist politician in America today.\u201d\n\nWhile others on this team may get more camera time and more accolades, Kris Kobach is the perennial professional presence that holds the white, anti-immigrant team together. He is one of the few people in the mainstream of the Republican Party pushing the alt-right agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he is nominally Kansas\u2019 secretary of state, Kobach travels around the country persuading governors and legislators to institute anti-immigrant laws like Alabama\u2019s H.B. 56, called \u201cthe most racist law in America,\u201d which forced police officers to ask for proof of status based on race and forbade citizens from renting property, selling cars or even allowing people to use swimming pools without proof of citizenship. Kobach\u2019s contributions might not show up on the stat sheets, but his racist policymaking is invaluable to the team.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not writing racist laws, practicing or playing, Kobach spends his spare time attending white nationalist conferences.\n\nWhenever you hear \u201cmost racist \u2026 ,\u201d you can bet that Kobach\u2019s name will be in the discussion. Dedication. Loyalty. Teamwork. That\u2019s why Kobach is an alt-right all-star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamous quote:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the wall is going to get built. The only question is how quickly will it get done and who pays for it?\u201d \u2014Kris Kobach, November 2016\n\n\n\nEric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPossible positions: Secretaries of coloring books\n\nNotable achievements in hate:\n\n\n\nRepeatedly tweet Nazi memes.\n\nGave an interview to a white nationalist radio show and then said it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nCompared refugees to poisonous Skittles.\n\nThere\u2019s always one guy who\u2019s only on the team because his dad is the coach. That\u2019s the Trump boys. They were born into privilege with everything a human being could ask for (except a defined jawline and the ability to think independently), even extra chromosomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey dwell in a perpetual state of shock when they discover that one of their tweets is propaganda from an alt-right or neo-Nazi account. No one ever asks them why all their social media friends seem to have white nationalist ties. If anyone did, I\u2019m sure their answer would be, \u201cJust wait till my father hears about this!\u201d\n\nAlthough they seem to be empty shells of hair pomade whose eyes are a little too close together, they try their hardest to perpetuate the hate their daddy expects.

The settlement includes a payment for a separate incident, the beating death of 48-year-old Raymond Robair, who was killed before the storm.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s office was instrumental in negotiating the settlement on behalf of the New Orleans Police Department, and he said that the settlement marks a painful moment in the history of the department, but it also provides closure for the victims and the city.\n\nLandrieu accepted responsibility for the slayings and apologized on behalf of the city, the Times-Picayune reports.\n\n\"We are going to change as a people and we are going to change as a city because we choose to,\" Landrieu said, adding that the city has taken major steps toward improving the operations of the Police Department to ensure that such violence and the subsequent cover-up would not occur again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In some small way, the lives that have been maimed and the lives have been taken were not lives that were or will be lived in vain,\" Landrieu said. \"The people standing behind you have chosen to give us the grace and the blessing of forgiveness for what it is that happened to them.\"\n\nAccording to the Times-Picayune, 20 officers were charged in connection with civil rights violations that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Monday\u2019s settlement covers 17 plaintiffs who brought different claims against the city, including wrongful death and personal injury.\n\nSix officers pleaded guilty for their involvement in the shootings, two of which were fatal, and the subsequent cover-up. Five of the officers were sentenced in April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result of the shootings on Danziger Bridge and the beating of Robair, the NOPD is under the most comprehensive federal consent decree in the country, Landrieu said. The department has since changed the way it hires, supervises and trains officers.\n\nNew Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison told the Times-Picayune that the department is training officers to de-escalate situations and is holding officers responsible for their use of force.\n\nHarrison said that part of that accountability is requiring officers to turn on body cameras, and that that is happening nearly 100 percent of the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we find a problem, we do not make excuses. We take swift action against anyone who chooses to make a bad decision,\" Harrison said. \"You have my commitment that we will continue to build a professional, community-oriented Police Department.\"\n\nThe Times-Picayune reports that earlier this fall, the City Council authorized city officials to take out loans that would help pay the settlements, and Landrieu said the settlements are expected to be paid out over the next 24 months.\n\nRead more at the Times-Picayune.", "keywords": ["way", "shootings", "civil", "officers", "landrieu", "timespicayune", "department", "bridge", "danziger", "taken", "case", "rights", "settlement", "13300000", "settles", "orleans", "city", "lives"], "polarity": -0.029681818181818188, "subjectivity": 0.42139393939393927},

Some of the infamous beads thrown into the crowds reflected the image of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to protest the removal of his statue from New Orleans\u2019 most prominent traffic circle, which has been a symbolic focal point of parade routes\u2014hence the bead\u2019s name, \u201cForever Lee Circle.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere were also Confederate-flag beads, T-shirts and an old image of the statue clandestinely projected on to City Hall. The Lee monument was removed by Mayor Mitch Landrieu on May 19, 2017, after steady pressure from the #TakeEmDownNOLA movement.\n\n\n\nInitially, the bead controversy mostly played out on local blogs and social media, but concerns over racism at Mardi Gras intensified this week after blackface figurines began popping up. In a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \u201cForever Lee Circle\u201d creator \u201cMikas Eaux\u201d insisted that \u201cthe beads serve as a conduit to take the stigma out of Southern history.\u201d\n\nAllies like Save Nola Heritage publicized the trinket as a fun, celebratory way to preserve history, deploying the hashtag #ThrowWhatchaWanna to equate the beads with free speech. But as progressives pointed out, the hashtag ironically evoked the upbeat, brassy jazz anthem \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d by Rebirth Brass Band, which is composed entirely of Afro-Creole and African-American musical elements.\n\nThis bitter exchange may seem out of place for an event known for apolitical merrymaking, but the collision of race and revelry is actually in keeping with Mardi Gras\u2019 long racial history. It\u2019s not the first time that white supremacists have used the parade in service of their goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the parading tradition itself grows right out of white anxiety over mixing and mingling between free and enslaved, black and white, rich and immigrant.\n\nBefore the 1850s, the New Orleanian celebration was more akin to the Carnevale of Venice, with its egalitarian street-level revelry and festivities. Contemporaneous newspapers and travelers reported sensationalized violence and sexual depravity of new immigrant populations, especially the Irish (who had not yet become white), and the alleged intimacy between white \u201cladies\u201d and masked black men occurring during Carnival.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, the growing English-speaking, Protestant population attempted to curtail the Carnival tradition celebrated by the Catholic Creoles. Early attempts failed, but by 1856, a tentative alliance between white Americans and white Creoles of the city\u2019s slaveholding and professional classes established the Mistick Krewe of Comus and transformed Carnival into the form we know today, a preapproved parade route followed in a neat, linear fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1857 the Comus Krewe introduced the tableaux vivant, or living picture, to Mardi Gras, which featured members of the secret society in elaborate costumes and posed upon lavishly decorated floats. The original floats presented allegories from classic mythology and literature, such as Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. Members were explicit about their motives\u2014in order to salvage Mardi Gras from what they saw as cultural degeneration, they presented the best of Anglophone culture and art and literally raised the city\u2019s elite white men to aspirational levels above the crowd.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, New Orleans\u2019 white elites used the pomp and ceremony of Mardi Gras to reassert symbolic and political control after the Confederacy\u2019s defeat. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 ushered in desegregated schools and public transportation, recognized the citizenship of African Americans, and granted the right to vote and hold office to African-American men without property requirements. Local white men perceived this new racial equality as a threat and were eager to recapture their former power.\n\nCarnival krewes took their political arguments to the streets and manipulated their festive displays to provide evidence of the illegitimacy and incongruity of black citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City Democratic Club, later renamed the Crescent City White League, whose stated goal was to prevent the \u201cAfricanization\u201d of New Orleans and Louisiana, formed the city\u2019s second krewe in 1870. The Twelfth Night Revelers regularly caricatured African-American lawmakers as bumbling crows or backward strongmen.\n\nComus presented its infamous \u201cthe Missing Links to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species\u201d and \u201cthe Aryan Race\u201d themes in 1873 and 1877, respectively. The former theme culminated with an anthropomorphic crowned gorilla standing in contrast against a white Comus, suggesting the innate inferiority of black men holding civic office. In like fashion, the Knights of Momus displayed comical yet grotesque representations of mixed-race people among equally grotesque animal hybrids in its 1873 parade themed \u201cthe Coming Races.\u201d\n\nMardi Gras had become a mode by which former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers could maintain symbolic power and communicate ideas of white supremacy, social Darwinism and the \u201cLost Cause\u201d even under the city\u2019s interracial Republican government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last century, African Americans, women and LGBTQ people have all established parading organizations that have at times directly and indirectly challenged the elite white male control of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn recent years, there has been searing political satire of the response to Hurricane Katrina and the 2016 election. This progress, however, only further demonstrates how the revelry and debauchery of Carnival does not have an inherent political bent. Carnival is a fluid, flexible form and, thus, allows for both progressive and prejudiced values to flourish. This year, my social media newsfeed was filled with posts bemoaning the Knights of Chaos\u2019 floats lampooning Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players and Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, sometimes racism looks like swastikas and tiki torches, but sometimes it looks like a parade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederick Staidum Jr., Ph.D., is a scholar of 19th-century American culture and literature at Loyola University Chicago and a Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project.

A group of college students in Ohio are the latest in the nation to accuse a dining establish of racial discrimination, or some sort of profiling, after a manager demanded that they pay for their meal up front because, you know, \u201cyou people steal.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Vindicator, a local newspaper, Youngstown State University student Samora Savage was with friends and classmates when they decided to go to the Royal Grill Buffet in Boardman. The group were asked to pay before they were allowed to be seated. Savage and her friends agreed to pay, but then noticed something was not quite right after she realized that other customers weren\u2019t asked to do the same.\n\nSavage asked the manager about the discrepancy, only for the manager to respond, \u201cYou people steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the way we were treated there,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nAnother diner who noticed the disagreement reportedly got involved and began shouting at the manager about the discriminatory behavior. But the manager, Jay Dong, apparently has no shame in his stance, and insists that his policies are not racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDong told the site that he makes some people pay up front, acknowledging that more often than not those customers are black, but notes that he does not think it\u2019s discrimination because he does not make all of his black customers pay first.

A little black girl painted in shades of purple stares and smiles, her palms facing upward, her curls encased in a halo. A poem about a wild, beautiful girl who was a shelter hints at what you\u2019ll find inside.\n\nStudio Be is that shelter, not just for Bmike\u2019s first solo show, \u201cEphemeral Eternal,\u201d but for glorious blackness. It features spray-painted images of civil rights icons, art installations replicating Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, and paintings of locals that change the conversation around who gets to be considered beautiful and holy.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of redemptive power in understanding your presence in the continuum,\u201d Bmike tells The Root of the reason behind his show\u2019s name. \u201cAnd knowing that you\u2019re not just an isolated incident, that somehow your existence is in a way part of a relay race, or a elevator, or escalator of moments.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, Studio Be has become a hot spot for celebrities, tourists and students looking to experience the elevation and celebration of street art. RZA has just wrapped the film he directed, Cut Throat City, starring Wesley Snipes, Kat Graham and T.I., inside Studio Be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle loved the show so much that he came back again with his wife and kids, buying pieces to hang in his home. Ava DuVernay filmed a scene for her hit show Queen Sugar at Studio Be, heavily featuring Bmike\u2019s paintings of slain Black Lives Matter icons Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Oscar Grant. Encapsulating the theme of a moment in time that ripples throughout time, the four hold protest signs modeled after those from the civil rights movement, reading \u201cI Am a Man.\u201d\n\nIn a meta way of art imitating life inspiring art, Bmike\u2019s paintings are used in the episode to teach a young teenager about black history. The studio itself has a \u201cyoung artists in residence\u201d wall where an average of four classes of students who tour the show a week can color in the black-and-white printouts of his paintings and take them home or hang them on the wall, along with phrases in chalk describing what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat part of it is, to me, more important than the superstars coming and the Queen Sugars happening,\u201d he says of the impact celebrities have on his ability to bring more kids to his show. \u201cIt\u2019s more beautiful when the kids come in and we\u2019re able to connect.\u201d\n\nBut just as Bmike and Studio Be are connecting with kids and finding their place in pop culture, the show is expected to close\u2014likely by the summer. Before it\u2019s taken apart and taken on the road, to be featured in studios around the country, The Root traveled to New Orleans to catch up with Bmike and experience \u201cEphemeral Eternal\u201d firsthand.\n\nIt is, in a word, dope.\n\n\n\nBroken into four rooms, the show begins with hope in the midst of struggle. In a piece painted on the front wall, a black woman stares down the barrel of a policeman\u2019s gun and plugs it with a rose. The slain Black Lives Matter icons are crowned with halos. Fannie Lou Hamer, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Muhammad Ali and Fred Hampton commune in various murals, a buffet of incontrovertible black excellence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one stands in the doorway looking into the second room, it almost looks as if the wall that Coretta Scott King is painted on is connected to the one Martin Luther King Jr. is painted on. From that angle, she\u2019s looking directly at him, and the words on both walls read from left to right, \u201cLove Supreme.\u201d But as you enter the \u201cLove\u201d room, there is an obvious, wide gap between Coretta\u2019s and Martin\u2019s walls. It signifies, for Bmike, the complexity of their relationship.\n\n\u201cMaybe [King] just loved a little bit too much, because some of his behavior as a human, people could find problematic, and I wanted to explore that but not in a subtle way,\u201d he says. Noting that much of MLK\u2019s infidelities were thrown in Coretta\u2019s face and yet she stayed with him, Bmike paints Coretta with an ambivalent look as she eyes her husband. \u201cMaybe she just had a better, a higher understanding of love and her love for him,\u201d he speculates with his work. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at him like, \u2018I see you, but I see you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn continuing to challenge how we view and define heroes, that room contains an old phone booth papered over with the FBI\u2019s redacted files on King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAllegedly, those [redacted] areas are supposed to be lifted in 2027, 2028, I think. So, what happens when we learn new information about Dr. King and the humanity of Dr. King? Would that change the way we preserve that eternal image of him?\u201d\n\nThose questions continue on the other side of King\u2019s wall to the most controversial of the pieces. Bmike has painted Black Panther leader and convicted rapist Eldridge Cleaver, along with words from one of Cleaver\u2019s love letters in his book Soul on Ice, which, within the context of love, Bmike admits is \u201ca totally different hurricane of ideas and emotions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a young kid in college, it really awakened me to this idea of black consciousness, in a way,\u201d he says of Cleaver\u2019s writing. \u201cBut then as I would share this with people, especially women would be very upset, especially because I overlooked or didn\u2019t focus on the fact that one of the reasons he was in jail was because he was raping women, and he had a way of justifying it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtesy of Studio Be Muhammad Ali mural at Studio Be.

That\u2019s the beauty of art, I think; it doesn\u2019t really remain one thing.\u201d\n\nPaintings of tatted-up locals as Black Jesus and Black Mary also used to mirror each other in this room, but a lucky patron took Jesus into his home, leaving the Holy Mother to bless the room on her own. In the very Catholic city of New Orleans, it\u2019s no small thing to make a black woman the pillar of God\u2019s love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat love is challenged as you move into the most devastating room in the warehouse. Half of a wooden ship sticks out of the wall, part slave ship, part rescue boat for the refugees of Hurricane Katrina. In the far-right corner sits what appears to be a regular living room: a floor lamp, TV, couch, family portraits on the wall. The bottom half of the portrait is covered in purple paint; then you notice that the rest of the wall is covered in purple, too, along with the entire couch, the floor lamp and all of the TV. Then it hits you: The purple paint is the water line, and everything below it is what was baptized when the levees broke.\n\n\n\nAn installation in the middle of the room is the eye of the hurricane, with white clouds and wind and shadows, and words for the survivors: \u201cYou\u2019re Still Here.\u201d A video compilation captures the dichotomy of the storm: Old gospel songs play over footage of thousands of black folks getting baptized in a river, intercut with footage from failed Katrina rescue efforts, Kanye West\u2019s \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d moment, and a cartoon of Noah\u2019s family praying and trembling inside the ark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final room brings you back to the beginning. The murals Bmike painted in abandoned and dilapidated buildings after Katrina that brought him to prominence a few years ago have been cut out of the walls and installed in Studio Be. As one looks back at these early murals of King, Malcolm X, Nina Simone and more, his growth in skill and theme over the past five years is apparent.\n\n\u201c[There was a time everyone had] halos and crowns,\u201d he says of his earlier pieces. But after a conversation with a mentor, his idea of the over-assertion of black royalty and black godliness became unnecessary. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018Why, at the expense of feeling less than human, do we have to boast a superhuman identity? Why we can\u2019t just be like, \u2018I\u2019m human, and that\u2019s enough for you to love and respect me?\u2019 And that kind of changed how I created from that point.\u201d\n\nNow a painting of a black teen girl, wearing a simple black T-shirt, hangs in his studio with the powerful message, \u201cI Am My Ancestors\u2019 Wildest Dreams.\u201d A millennial black man, tatted up and shirtless, re-creates an iconic photo by drinking from a water fountain marked \u201cWhite Only,\u201d eyes staring into you. Before it sold, a painting hung of another young black boy in a red tee standing next to the word \u201cAlchemist.\u201d Three kids. Just humans. All worthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was like, OK, how can I approach paintings like that and say it\u2019s enough that this person exists? I don\u2019t need to add a crown or a halo to force somebody to be like, \u2018Oh, this person is valuable,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nThough these revelations in the form of Studio Be will only be around for a short while longer, Bmike\u2019s work isn\u2019t going anywhere. In honor of New Orleans\u2019 300th anniversary, Bmike has been commissioned to paint a series of murals highlighting the hidden history of people and communities throughout the city.\n\nHis goal remains for black kids to see value in themselves when they walk away from his work, in whatever context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to see a different prism of their potential and possibility,\u201d he says. When kids walk through his studio and say, \u201cI could do that,\u201d it\u2019s the most exciting thing for him: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yes! You can! I hope you do it better.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that way, he says, the art lives forever.", "keywords": ["way", "studio", "room", "odums", "queen", "paint", "root", "love", "glorious", "painted", "sugar", "art", "featured", "blackness", "wall", "orleans", "bmike", "celebrating", "black"], "polarity": 0.1028882432146764, "subjectivity": 0.4517228489839952},

The technology, implemented after New Orleans\u2019 murder rate was the highest in the nation, traces so-called criminals\u2019 ties to other gang members, analyzes their social media, and outlines and predicts the likelihood that individuals might commit violence or become a victim.\n\nAlthough there are similar programs in other American cities, what makes this partnership especially egregious is that no onenot the defense attorneys defending alleged gang members who were tracked by this software, nor the New Orleans City Council, nor the public\u2014knew that it was being used.\n\nAnd on top of that, Palantir is a data-mining firm founded with seed money from the CIA\u2019s venture capital fund.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2004, the company was co-founded by racist colonizer and venture capitalist Peter Thiel (also the company\u2019s single-largest shareholder), who has raked in millions of dollars with Palantir through contracts with the Pentagon and United States intelligence services, as well as foreign security services.\n\n\n\nThe Verge reports that Palantir\u2019s partnership with the notorious NOPD (which itself has had serious issues around civil rights abuses) has been extended three times, with the third extension scheduled to expire Feb. 21, 2018. No one will confirm if it has been extended again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program escaped public notice, according to the Verge, \u201cpartly because Palantir established it as a philanthropic relationship with the city through Mayor Mitch Landrieu\u2019s signature NOLA for Life program. Thanks to its philanthropic status, as well as New Orleans\u2019 \u2018strong mayor\u2019 model of government, the agreement never passed through a public procurement process.\u201d\n\n\n\nPredictive policing technology is already controversial in that many believe it\u2019s just another way to implement racial profiling. Given that the city of New Orleans is 60 percent black, and that poor, black communities there bear the brunt of over-policing, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to guess who this flawed system will be used against.\n\nAccording to Florida Tech, other issues with predictive technology include the obvious threat to privacy, over-reliance on technology and lack of context when making claims against defendants (i.e., just because someone has a Facebook relationship with an alleged gang member doesn\u2019t make that person a gang member, too).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Verge says that there are even some concerns within the law enforcement community itself because five years after it was started in New Orleans, the company has sold at least one crime-forecasting system to foreign intelligence services for predicting the likelihood of individuals to commit terrorism and yet this system is being used in these United States against its own (black) citizens.\n\n\u201cPalantir is a great example of an absolutely ridiculous amount of money spent on a tech tool that may have some application,\u201d a former officer told the Verge anonymously. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not the right tool for local and state law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot only that, given the NOPD\u2019s documented abuses around biased policing and racial profiling, inadequate training and supervision, and failure to engage in community-oriented policing (they can now just sit behind a desk and find all the so-called \u201cbad guys\u201d), this is without a doubt a threat to the black community of Crescent City\u2014who had no idea it was even being used against them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the end of the article notes, \u201cIf Palantir\u2019s partnership with New Orleans had been public, the issues of legality, transparency, and propriety could have been hashed out in a public forum during an informed discussion with legislators, law enforcement, the company, and the public. For six years, that never happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more about this secretive, discriminatory, costly mess that has made some white men very rich off the backs of black bodies\u2014all in the name of crime-reduction\u2014here.", "keywords": ["ciabacked", "palantir", "gang", "technology", "public", "used", "guess", "kept", "pd", "company", "system", "policing", "targets", "orleans", "secret", "verge", "black"], "polarity": 0.00788908671973188, "subjectivity": 0.4093614718614718},

Fitzgibbon, who was there with two friends, told the Daily News that the restaurant, located on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, was packed, so they started to move toward the bar.\n\nAs they ordered drinks and got ready to enjoy themselves, a manager reportedly came up to them, demanding to know how they were going to pay for their beverages.\n\n\u201cYou were here last week and ran up a tab and left,\u201d the manager insisted, according to Fitzgibbon.\n\nRemember, this was Fitzgibbon\u2019s first time at the restaurant, so naturally, she was thoroughly confused and tried to explain as much to the manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-year-old said that the manager started to act out, snatching a menu from her and banging on the bar, yelling at her that she was lying and that he had video of her dining and dashing just days prior.\n\n\u201cWe were beyond embarrassed,\u201d Fitzgibbon recalled. \u201cI felt dehumanized.\u201d\n\nThe manager proceeded to show Fitzgibbon the surveillance footage from his phone, but, of course, the black women seen in the footage looked \u201cnothing\u201d like her, according to Fitzgibbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat, do all black people look alike to you?\u201d Fitzgibbon\u2019s friend Tamara Young chimed in at that point, according to the report.\n\nThe enraged manager yelled at the group of friends to leave the restaurant, repeatedly pushing Young as they walked out, as indicated in the police reports that both women filed.\n\n\u201cThey made us feel as if we were criminals,\u201d Fitzgibbon said.\n\nBoth Fitzgibbon and Young are considering taking legal action, but they are not the only ones who say they have had a less-than-pleasant experience at the restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman, identified only as Kristina, claimed in a Yelp review that during her own Feb. 10 visit to Angel of Harlem, she ran into trouble with a female bartender who tried to overcharge her.\n\nWhen Kristina tried to address the issue, she said that the bartender started to accuse her boyfriend of stealing alcohol.\n\n\u201cWe were told that my partner had been stealing drinks from the counter and that is why we were charged extra,\u201d Kristina wrote in her Yelp review, according to the Daily News. \u201cIf he had been stealing, why weren\u2019t we kicked out then?

But as the city celebrates its 300th anniversary this year, she, too, will become part of its story as its first female mayor.\n\n\n\nFor nearly 30 years, the Xavier University grad has been making New Orleans her home and the people her community. It\u2019s apparent as Cantrell and her team sit with The Root for lunch at the city\u2019s famous soul food restaurant Dooky Chase\u2019s. Before the waiter can even take her order, no fewer than five people stop by our back-corner table to congratulate the mayor-elect, to thank her or to just say hello.\n\n\u201cPeople feel like they matter,\u201d Cantrell explains concerning how she\u2019s been able to connect with her constituents. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you see how the people respond to me because, I believe, they feel and they realize that I\u2019m for them.\u201d\n\nCantrell, a longtime resident of the Broadmoor neighborhood, became the president of the Broadmoor Improvement Association just a year before the levees broke after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When then-Mayor Ray Nagin\u2019s recovery commission put forth a recovery plan that included not rebuilding Broadmoor and many other predominantly black neighborhoods, but instead turning them into parks, Cantrell and other leaders of the community fought back to make sure those neighborhoods would be restored.\n\nAfter winning election to the City Council in 2012 and 2014 and introducing a bill that the council unanimously passed to ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the city, Cantrell sought out the highest office in the city. (Because of legislative and city-charter changes, Cantrell, who was elected Nov. 18, will be sworn in May 7.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy vision [for New Orleans] is for real inclusion and real equity in this city to where we truly are meeting people where they are regardless of who and race, as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThat manifests itself in many different ways: in real growth and opportunity; being able to be connected to not just a job but professional growth opportunities as well; starting your own business; the quality of education is the same no matter where you are.\u201d\n\nMentioning the fact that New Orleans\u2019 incarceration rate is nearly double the nationwide rate, Cantrell shares her commitment to strengthening community support to decrease crime, and re-entry programs to help the formerly incarcerated have another chance at a full life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build people up so that they can feel their worth in their city,\u201d she says of her upcoming administration\u2019s focus on the most vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to measure myself: How am I impacting the most vulnerable?\u201d she adds. \u201cPeople who have done well, they\u2019ve done well and they should be able to continue to do well, but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of those who cannot and do not have an opportunity to do well.\u201d\n\nRecently, Cantrell released her transition plan, consisting of six committees, 19 subcommittees and 12 working groups that will advise the mayor-elect on policies in key areas\u2014from transportation to education.\n\n\u201cWe will be focusing on neighborhood stabilization, economic development and growth, public safety [and] infrastructure improvements as well as healthy families,\u201d says Cantrell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the key to both her election and her upcoming administration, she says, will be accountability.\n\n\u201cNew Orleanians will tell you straight,\u201d she says. \u201cSo accountability is continuing to be accessible; having, again, that ability to listen to people. You\u2019re accountable by being able to demonstrate that you have listened because it needs to culminate into some level of action that impacts people.\u201d\n\nThat action, she says, must be open to scrutiny: \u201cWhen you remain accessible, that means you\u2019re not hiding from them, so you\u2019re always open to the criticisms, the feedback, the input, the ideas\u2014and I just plan to continue to be that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example, Cantrell shares the story of one of her supporters, \u201cMs. Helen,\u201d who texted her the day before our chat: \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s amazing. A woman who was homeless can text the next mayor.

Mitchell, who had spent his childhood listening to family stories, said he was related to the legendary Oscar James Dunn. But according to Mitchell, his teacher had no idea who that was. \u201cHe\u2019s the first black Lieutenant Governor, not just for Louisiana, but for the entire nation,\u201d Mitchell remembers saying. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a black lieutenant governor of Louisiana,\u201d his teacher replied.\n\n\n\nBut there was, and he was Mitchell\u2019s great great great-uncle. \u201cAs I child, I\u2019d spend my days after school with my great-grandmother,\u201d Mitchell recalls. And her family stories \u201calways sort of lead to important patriarchs or matriarchs,\u201d including Dunn. Now Mitchell is an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and he\u2019s spent much of his career studying Dunn so future teachers don\u2019t make the same mistake his did some four decades ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a black lieutenant governor of Louisiana,\u201d his teacher said.\n\nAs New Orleans has been in the national spotlight over the removal of four city monuments\u2014all erected after the end of Reconstruction, years after the Civil War, to reassert white power\u2014Mitchell is bringing attention to a monument of is ancestor that was intended to be built. It was supposed to honor Reconstruction\u2019s success, and it featured a prominent black politician named Oscar James Dunn, who during his relatively short life wrestled with white politicians over civil rights.\n\n\n\nDunn was supposed to be a hero: Around the time he suffered an untimely and mysterious death, a journalist wrote, \u201cThere will be three pictures that hang in the home of every African-American \u2026 Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and Oscar James Dunn.\u201d Thanks to some historical amnesia, and a smear campaign against Dunn, that didn\u2019t end up being true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn was born in New Orleans around 1822 to an enslaved mother. She fell in love with a free man of color named James who bought her and her two children for $800 in 1831. By the time Oscar James Dunn turned 11, he was free: \u201cThat changes Dunn\u2019s life forever,\u201d Mitchell says. Now the young Dunn could go to school\u2014and he was good at school. He learned a trade (plastering) and he was excellent at that, too. Dunn grew up to become the head of the black Masonic Lodges in Louisiana, a powerful civic force working on education and youth initiatives for free blacks in the state. Then the Civil War ended, and the Reconstruction era began.\n\nAround this time, \u201cAfrican-Americans are all over the South,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThey\u2019re released and people need their labor for agriculture.\u201d Dunn opened an office to cater to their needs, and used his education to write contracts for recently released enslaved people, so they could work on plantations without being cheated.\n\nDunn made sure these newly free people actually got paid for their labor, and he was quite good at that, too\u2014which inspired those close to him to suggest he might make a good politician. Around that time, people of color freed prior to the Emancipation Proclamation (like Dunn) were beginning to enter politics. Dunn ran for office: he was elected to be Louisiana\u2019s Lieutenant governor in 1868.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn was a member of what was known as the Radical Republican party. \u201cThey were the progressive party that was trying to extend civil rights to African Americans, especially in the South,\u201d says Nick Weldon, who works for the Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and research center. Weldon discovered Dunn\u2019s history as he was going through some of his historical documents. He recently found quotes from the New Orleans Times where local Democrats described Dunn, their political opponent, and the \u201cthe taint of honesty and of scrupulous regard for the official properties,\u201d which was a \u201cserious drawback in innervating a reproach on the lieutenant governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did a lot against a lot of pressure, and in a pretty hostile environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, they\u2019re like, he is so fair-minded and scrupulous that it\u2019s annoying,\u201d Weldon says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn used such bipartisan respect to advance his career: \u201cHe became a big proponent for universal male suffrage\u201d as well as civil rights legislation and the integration of public schools, according to Weldon. \u201cHe did a lot against a lot of pressure, and in a pretty hostile environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHostile\u201d is one way to put it. The Louisiana governor at the time was a man named Henry Warmoth, a white, 20-something Republican from New York. Three years after the Civil War ended, in 1868, he and Dunn were elected on the same ticket. Dunn was two decades older than Governor Warmoth, and at first Dunn believed, perhaps naively, that this young Yankee wanted equality between white Louisianans and their black counterparts. But then Governor Warmoth betrayed Lieutenant Governor Dunn.\n\n\u201cWhen it actually came time for him to sign a bill that would protect blacks,\u201d Brian Mitchell says, \u201che says no.\u201d The governor vetoed a bill that would have penalized bus and business owners who did not provide equal services to both races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Governor Warmoth refused to sign this civil rights bill, it divided the Republican party. Despite the fact that that both Dunn and Warmoth were members of the same party, they found themselves in direct competition over the most explosive issues of the time. There was a Dunn camp and a Warmoth camp at the time; they had separate police forces, seperate conventions.\n\n\u201cIt was complete chaos,\u201d Weldon says. \u201cThere was no order.\u201d\n\nWarmoth began to lose power. The Democrats, once Souther Confederates, didn\u2019t accept Governor Warmoth because they saw him as a \u201ccarpetbagger,\u201d a foreign leader with little local interest. The Radical Republicans, and in particular the black members of the party, realized quickly that Governor Warmoth was working against their interests. By 1872 another gubernatorial election was on the horizon, and there was talk amongst these factions of impeaching Warmoth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Dunn\u2019s career was going well\u2014and if Warmoth were to be impeached, he would become the first black governor in the country. Rumors started flying around the state that that the president of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, was considering Dunn as his vice president after Dunn visited the capitol. And then, in November of 1871, Dunn went to a public dinner. Two days later, he was dead.\n\nAnd then, in November of 1871, Dunn went to a public dinner. Two days later, he was dead.\n\nAccording Mitchell, Dunn fell violently ill soon after attending the dinner, vomiting, shivering, and falling unconscious. He called a few close friends, says Mitchell, but there wasn\u2019t much they could do. \u201cAnd there is speculation that he may have been, as they say, \u2018dosed\u2019\u201d with poison.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick Weldon says Dunn\u2019s death was a \u201cshock to the city.\u201d The official cause of death: congestion of the brain and lungs, technically classified as natural causes. But many people, Weldon included, say Dunn\u2019s symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning. And four out of the seven doctors who examined the lieutenant governor refused to sign off on the official cause of death.\n\nBut, says, Mitchell, \u201cwe really just don\u2019t know what happened to Dunn.\u201d His immediate family refused an autopsy, so we\u2019ll never know whether he was poisoned by political rivals. It remains something of a historical mystery. \u201cThere have probably been more papers on Dunn\u2019s death than on Dunn\u2019s life,\u201d Mitchell notes.\n\nDunn died at the age of 49, at the height of his political career. The city was in shock. \u201cOver 50,000 people turned out for the funeral. It\u2019s called the largest in New Orleans\u2019 history,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThe composition of the crowd was made up of every facet of New Orleans society, black and white. And I always point out that it\u2019s probably one of the oldest second lines in New Orleans history. There are jazz bands that are there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mourners included most of Dunn\u2019s political rivals\u2014the men who could have poisoned him. Governor Warmoth, of all people, was a pallbearer. The second line stretched a mile long, from the intersection of Claiborne and Canal (where Dunn\u2019s house is) to Magazine street. It proceeded to the cemetery. \u201cTo say he was well loved in the city would have been an understatement,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nBut that regard was never memorialized the way white Confederate heroes were. Weldon says $10,000 was dedicated to create a monument of Dunn in an act signed by the governor\u2014a couple hundred thousand, in today\u2019s money\u2014but it was never spent. Today, we don\u2019t even really know why. \u201cAll I know is that it isn\u2019t there,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nBut he has found evidence of a movement to discredit Dunn: an old drawing from that era of a Mardi Gras ball, where the Krewe of Comus dressed their king up as an ape to mock the lieutenant governor. \u201cI argue,\u201d says Mitchell, \u201cthat it\u2019s at this point that revisionists start trying to take over the narrative and rewrite Dunn as a villain instead of a hero in American history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy taking down Dunn, they were able to reinforce notions of black inferiority in Louisiana.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see this somewhat rising African-American political star at the time of all this strife \u2026 The guy dies and pretty much with him was all the gains that he had fought for: Civil rights, suffrage, integration in public schools,\u201d Weldon says.\n\n\n\n\u201cReconstruction started to go away after that. At the same time, the Ku Klux Klan is just getting started. The White League is just getting started,\u201d Weldon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy taking down Dunn, they were able to reinforce notions of black inferiority in Louisiana,\u201d Mitchell points out.\n\nSo two decades after Dunn died, instead of building a monument for a formerly enslaved man who could have become the vice president, a monument goes up in Liberty Place to honor a white supremacist group, the Crescent City white League.\n\n\u201cAll of this progress that was made gets immediately wiped off the slate,\u201d Weldon says. But a hundred years later, Dunn\u2019s descendant, Brian Mitchell, goes to elementary school in New Orleans, where his teacher tells him his ancestor never existed. \u201cMy entire life I went to classes, and I loved history. And I heard about Manifest Destiny and I heard about the melting pot, and none of these things seem to explain my condition as an African-American in the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Dunn did.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our conversation, I asked Mitchell if he thought the scrapped monument to Dunn would have made a difference in how well-known the politician was. \u201cMost certainly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

About an hour into [our] dinner we were approached by a Independence police officer, a mall cop, and the restaurant manager. We were told that we were accused of eating and not paying for CHICKEN the day before (dining and dashing). Mind you that we have proof that can show our whereabouts and it\u2019s not even in our character to steal. After being mocked, humiliated, and embarrassed we were asked to pay for our food, leave, and not come back. After leaving, calls were made to the restaurant and the manager stated that our accuser remembered that there was a SKINNY girl and a girl who wore MAKEUP. In 2018 is this really what we\u2019re debased to? Our weight and whether or not we wore makeup. She could not recognize any facial features or any defining characteristics .

Just because we are black does not mean we are all criminals and I will not be treated as such. #repost Applebee\u2019s Grill & Bar\n\nIn the video, it is easy to see that both women are shocked, embarrassed and upset at the accusation.

My son has had the same nightmares every night since then as well. Most people will say, \u201cBe lucky he wasn\u2019t shot or killed,\u201d but when you send your child to college, the last thing you expect to happen is for him to call you at 1:30 a.m. on a Sunday saying that a traffic stop turned into police officers drawing their guns.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, my son was heading back to his college campus in Petersburg, Va., after hanging out in Richmond, Va. He was driving, and his friend from college was the passenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a few blocks from approaching the gates of their university, they spotted the Chesterfield County, Va., police at what looked like checkpoints near an off-campus party location. According to my son, he approached a stop sign, stopped and proceeded through it. Shortly after, as he was approaching the university, cops pulled him over, saying that he had done a \u201croll stop\u201d instead of a full stop (we\u2019ll get back to this in a few).\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the story goes from being just a routine stop to every parent\u2019s nightmare:\n\nThe cops then used the age-old tactic of, \u201cSir, we smell marijuana in your car,\u201d and asked my son and his friend to exit the vehicle. Mind you, neither of them smokes. The only smells ever in my son\u2019s car are those of his dirty gym clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chesterfield County police officers (who were white) then approached my son and asked if he was carrying a weapon. My son informed them that he had his pocketknife in his pocket (a knife that is legal to carry and which I had given him because of the area where his school is located).\n\nWhen my son went to pull up his shorts to show the officers the knife in his pocket, guns were drawn on him. Because I\u2019ve had the \u201ctalk\u201d with my son several times, he knew what to do if ever he was in any sort of contact with police. As the cops continued to search his car and found nothing, my son and his friend remained calm and actually talked about their history paper on democracy. The irony.\n\nAfter the search was over and the guns were put away, one of the Chesterfield County police officers asked my son and his friend if they were OK with how the situation had been handled. And, of course, they replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Because, of course, the officers were trying to intimidate them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter they gave their reply, the officers laughed and sent them on their merry way, without a ticket for this alleged \u201croll-through\u201d of a stop sign.\n\nMy son called me at 1:23 Sunday morning. I thought it was his usual check-in call, but he was hysterical, angry and scared. I had no idea what was going on because I couldn\u2019t get him to calm down. He had remained calm in front of the police officers because I had told him to never let them see you sweat. But as soon as he was away from them and got me on the phone, there was no reason not to let out his anger and frustration.\n\nAs soon as he told me what had happened, my heart sank. And the anger rose. First with my son, because I had warned him about being out on a Saturday night in that area. As a young black man with a fairly decent car, you\u2019re bait for cops. But then I became enraged because my son has done everything right in life and can\u2019t even attend college without being profiled and ending up looking down the barrel of a police officer\u2019s gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy son was so distraught, he couldn\u2019t even tell me which police department had pulled him over. For reference, in the area of his university, there\u2019s the Petersburg Police Department, the Colonial Heights Police Department, the Chesterfield County Police Department and the university\u2019s own police department. I literally had to call each police department to figure out which was involved in the stop. And after I called Chesterfield County twice, the sergeant on duty finally said that its Police Department was involved.\n\nAround 3 a.m. Sunday, I was informed by the sergeant on duty that its officers were equipped with bodycams and that he had seen the video, and if I wanted to have a copy, I should put in a Freedom of Information Act request. And so I did.\n\nThe following morning, Feb. 5., my FOIA request was denied by Karen Leonard, the department\u2019s FOIA officer, who in an email wrote, \u201cThe Code of Virginia, \u00a72.2-3706, Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), states that complaints, memoranda, correspondence, case files or reports, witness statements and evidence relating to a criminal investigation or prosecution, other than criminal incident information, are excluded from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked what exactly was being investigated, since no citation or crime was committed, Leonard replied, \u201cCriminal investigations do not always result in charges or arrests. I have referred you to the investigator, Officer Murphy, for any information he can share.\u201d\n\nSo, of course, I emailed Officer Murphy of the Chesterfield County Police Department, and he wanted to know what information my son had shared with me. Yeah, no. Why would I give that information?\n\nHe then informed me, \u201cDue to the fact that he is an adult, I am not allowed to discuss anything that he has not informed you of previously. That is why I was asking you to please share with me what your son has already told you so I know what I can and cannot discuss with you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked for an authorization form my son could sign, to release any information about the stop to me, Murphy seemingly went silent.\n\nRegardless, before all of the interaction with Murphy, on the advice of an attorney, I had already filed a complaint with the Chesterfield County cops\u2019 internal-affairs department.\n\nThere have been other complaints from students about the actions of the police officers in the area when it comes to harassment. But unlike my son and his friend and me, many are afraid to speak out. But if you choose to be silent, you\u2019re choosing to keep others in harm\u2019s way and not changing the flawed law enforcement system.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, here I am now, with the same headache from Sunday. Still trying to help my son process the fact that he\u2019s lucky he wasn\u2019t shot or killed. Still trying to figure out the next steps. Still trying to figure out why guns were drawn.

It\u2019s been a profound and joyful labor of love for the professor and now producer\u2014with an endowed chair in political science at North Carolina Central University\u2014whose academic work has focused specifically on black body politics and black racial identity:\n\nMost of my work is about trying to teach through images. I use images\u2014and now, moving images\u2014to spark conversations ... [but] the fulfillment for me now is coming from recognizing that the internet and these platforms are my classroom. The joy that I get when the light bulbs go off for my students, I also get that when just being able to have regular conversations with folks and throwing some information, or pushing folks to think a little differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversations sparked by the first season of Professional Black Girl resonated deeply with all types of black women. This, despite the show\u2019s concept being a happy accident that occurred while Blay was developing another series, centered on black hair:\n\nAnd then, once I launched it, it just became a thing. I mean, I wasn\u2019t ready for it, but it brings me so much joy. I\u2019ve gotten so many messages from women\u2014I mean, women have stopped me on the street just to say \u201cThank you.\u201d And it\u2019s, like, amazing to me to hear women who are, like, literally rocket scientists, and medical doctors, and CEOs who are saying, \u201cGirl, thank you.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s ready to take her show on the road, hoping to film her second season in New Orleans\u2014hopefully, with a little help from her Professional Black Girl friends:\n\nNew Orleans is and has long been considered probably the most\u2014not just black\u2014but the most African city in America ... I\u2019m used to being in black spaces, but, like, there\u2019s something different about New Orleans and it\u2019s really\u2014for me\u2014it\u2019s culture, you know? And so, when I think of how I came to be a professional black girl, of course it\u2019s based upon my memories and my experiences growing up in New Orleans. There\u2019s just nowhere like New Orleans, you know? I just feel like we deserve so much better than the memory of Katrina. Like, we still there, so wanting the joy that Professional Black Girl has brought to us up to this point, [I\u2019m] wanting to bring some of that to New Orleans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a brief 48 hours, Blay\u2019s season 2 Kickstarter campaign has gained significant steam. But as she now works to bring this project to NOLA and beyond, she could use our support\u2014and is already focused on the bigger picture:\n\nMy intention is to crowdfund this, But I hope it catches the attention of a major platform or production company or angel investor or somebody with some money who recognizes how important this is to black women. ... We\u2019re out here, [and] we want to see a variety of depictions of ourselves and our experiences in the same kind of regular ways that white folks get to see themselves. And this is regular, everyday kind of joy. And so, I\u2019m constantly thinking of how I can move the project forward ... each season will be another city, and through Professional Black Girl experiences, then you would get to know a little bit about the city, outside of whatever is the popular area ... I\u2019m trying to think of places that we don\u2019t always go to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Professional Black Girls ourselves, here\u2019s the official endorsement from The Glow Up: If you haven\u2019t yet checked out Professional Black Girl for yourself, you definitely should. It\u2019s addictive and affirmative. And if you feel moved to support, you should do that, as well. But more than anything, whatever kind of Professional Black Girl you might be, be that\u2014in all of your regular-black-girl glory. Because all other credentials aside, trust us, it\u2019s enough. And it is uniquely ours.

She put some of the luxury goods on her business credit card, and paid for the rest in cash. Hale, who owns a training center for nurses in East Point, Mich., says that the clerk told her she could leave her purchases with her as she continued shopping, which Hale did.\n\nThat should have been that.\n\nBut while Hale was checking out some sunglasses, someone called the Troy police. The next thing she knew, she was being confronted by an officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018You and you, I need to talk to you,\u2019\u201d Dana told WXYZ.\n\n\n\nHer daughter began filming the encounter with the police on her cellphone.

Executive chef Leah Chase goes table to table with her walker, greeting and taking pictures with patrons who have come to dine on her world-famous fried chicken and gumbo.\n\n\n\nThe place is teeming with history; Dooky Chase\u2019s sits in Trem\u00e9, the oldest black neighborhood in the country, and nearly 80 years after it opened in 1941, it\u2019s still the place to be. Chase is as much of a reason for guests to come as her food.\n\nHer 95th birthday was Jan. 6, arriving just as the city began celebrating its tricentennial. The culinary icon was just a few days shy of her own milestone when The Glow Up caught up with her.\n\nAs she makes her way back into the kitchen for a chat, she doesn\u2019t get far before an excited food blogger comes up behind her. Anxious but polite, he asks, \u201cPlease, Mrs. Chase, can I take a picture with you? We love you in Brazil!\u201d\n\nShe happily obliges, turning around with her walker to pose for a photo. She\u2019s rocking a hot-pink jacket emblazoned with \u201cChef Chase\u201d over the left pocket, a matching bedazzled cowboy hat and the widest smile. Chase loves every minute of these moments with guests\u2014even as much as the ones she\u2019s had with legends from Martin Luther King Jr. to presidents, musicians and literary giants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot say this one was better than that one,\u201d she tells The Glow Up about not playing favorites with her patrons, finally making it back to her seat in the kitchen behind a folding table piled high with papers and a pitcher of sweet tea.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t mention the time in 2008 when she fed Barack Obama and slapped his hand away when he tried to ruin her gumbo by putting hot sauce in it. I\u2019ve heard the story from others in her orbit at least twice, and pictures of a black-haired Obama grinning with his bowl of gumbo and embracing Chase line the front of the restaurant.\n\n\u201cEverybody leaves you [with] a little something,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd if they succeed in life and you say, \u2018Oh, I fed them,\u2019 you feel good that you had some part of that life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase has been impacting lives with her soul food since the middle of the 20th century. The former French Quarter waitress married musician Edgar \u201cDooky\u201d Chase Jr. in 1946. Together, the two eventually took over the po\u2019boy sandwich shop and bar that Dooky Chase Sr. and his wife, Emily, founded and turned it into a sit-down restaurant with Leah cooking the meals.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, the upper room of Dooky Chase\u2019s was the spot where movement leaders held their planning meetings over a plate of her food. Ray Charles immortalized the restaurant in his song \u201cEarly in the Morning,\u201d and Disney used Chase\u2019s story as the inspiration for its first black princess, Tiana, in The Princess and the Frog. When Beyonc\u00e9 filmed her iconic visual album, Lemonade, in the city, she featured Chase sitting in front of gold curtains on a plush chair fit for the Queen of Creole Cuisine.\n\nFor Chase, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cEverybody can\u2019t be a leader. But everybody can follow and help a good leader,\u201d she says of her role in supporting James Baldwin, Mahalia Jackson and countless others with a good meal. \u201cIf you\u2019re just feeding them and talking to them and just encouraging them and ... pray a whole lot, pray that they come back and pray that they succeed \u2026 you\u2019re going to wind up winning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase picked up that lesson of service from her father, a farmer in the 2.5 square miles of Madisonville, La. Before she made her way to New Orleans in the sixth grade because of the small town\u2019s lack of high schools for black children, Chase helped her father plant food for their family and neighbors to eat.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t one to plant one little row to service his family,\u201d she says of her father. \u201cHe planted plenty so he could share it around. And he always told us that there were three things we have to do in life: pray, work and do for others.\u201d\n\nThough Chase says there\u2019s no \u201csecret\u201d to living into her 10th decade on earth, her father\u2019s advice may hold the key.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody has a guarantee upon anything.

But still, their dynamic partnership\u2014Oprah starring in Selma and DuVernay\u2019s upcoming film, A Wrinkle In Time, and Ava creating Queen Sugar for the Oprah Winfrey Network\u2014is #SquadGoals. Let\u2019s also remember that Oprah is famous for advising up-and-coming black entertainers about how to manage their coins: \u201cSign your own checks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanda Sykes is only one of a few heavy hitters who are publicly disclosing their \u201cpaltry\u201d paychecks. In a recently leaked meeting, Tracee Ellis Ross revealed that she makes \u201csignificantly less\u201d than Black-ish co-star Anthony Anderson.\n\nAs actress Jada Pinkett Smith recently tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Hollywood\u2019s black leading ladies are being shafted, then how much more are we being undervalued and underpaid overall?\n\nTime\u2019s truly up on us being lowballed or, worse\u2014lowballing ourselves.\n\nAfter I left my full-time job three years ago, I learned a disturbing fact: As a director, I had been paid the same salary as a colleague who was a manager. I was two promotions ahead of her, a few years her senior; heck\u2014I had helped train her when she was an intern. Yet we made the same amount.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly I realized that I should have ignored my boss\u2019s encouragement to keep my salary a secret. Every time I received a slight pay raise, she made it seem as if she had advocated for me, and advised me not to discuss it with my colleagues, for fear that they would become jealous.\n\nToday I recognize that my pay increases were minuscule compared with what I could have received. But I didn\u2019t realize it then, because I never talked money with my co-workers. I chose to operate within the siloed American work culture that silences discussions about pay.\n\nAs a freelance writer, I\u2019ve struggled with owning my worth and demanding commensurate financial compensation. Two years ago, a publication invited me to become a regular contributor. I asked my community of women writers what to charge. They suggested rates, standard industry rates, but the rates felt too high to me. I quoted the editor 55 percent less than what my peers suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s very doable,\u201d I immediately knew that I had lowballed myself. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t think that my work warranted the higher rate. In other words, I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\n\nArguably more than any other group, we as black women must fearlessly advocate for our paychecks, and it begins with the belief in our worth.\n\nAfter Viola Davis received her best actress Oscar, she surprisingly admitted to struggling with self-doubt. \u201cI still have the imposter syndrome,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cSome days, I wake up and think, \u2018Everybody\u2019s gonna see me for the hack that I am \u2026 until I realize that I do know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe does know what she\u2019s doing.\n\nWe do, too.\n\nTo become the staunch advocates that our paychecks need us to be, we must do three things:\n\nNetwork\n\nWe need to connect with other black women\u2014inside and outside our industries. We must reach ahead and behind with the recognition that it feels as good to give as it does to receive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, ask your colleagues which professional groups they belong to. Ask your friends if they have friends in your industry they can connect you to. Join online industry groups. I belong to about a dozen professional groups on Facebook, which have resulted in new contracts and increased confidence. My favorite group is a community of seven black women writers whom I connect with almost daily. We discuss our challenges, encourage one another and talk money. Each one is my Wanda Sykes.\n\nAsk\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask your sistah-friends what they make. Now, I know that can be a bit awkward, but you can simply say something like, \u201cI have a personal question for you: Do you mind sharing with me how much you made on project X?\u201d Or you can pose a more general question: \u201cDo you mind telling me the pay range for someone in your position? I want to ensure that I\u2019m not short-changing myself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTell\n\nIf a sistah-friend asks about your paycheck, tell her! The longer we\u2019re all hush-hush about our pay, the longer we can all be lowballed. We must abandon the toxic, individualistic cultural mores that say that talking about money is taboo. We must relinquish long-held cultural norms that discourage us from \u201ctellin\u2019 our business\u201d\u2014because they no longer serve us. If we take a collective approach to owning our worth and demanding that worth, we will all rise, together.", "keywords": ["sistahfriend", "pay", "davis", "lowballed", "paid", "money", "worth", "need", "sykes", "women", "wanda", "know", "black"], "polarity": 0.06734326018808777, "subjectivity": 0.36487456987457},

So keep the check with you, verify, take your time,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply we were just going there to deposit a check.

I\u2019m trying to figure out what did we do,\u201d Sattar Ali said.\n\n\u201cNo one told me why I was being arrested until we were being released,\u201d he told the Sunflower. \u201cThey didn\u2019t read me rights or anything.\u201d\n\nAli now believes that he was racially profiled and called out Wichita for the actions taken against him and his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey jumped to conclusions,\u201d Ali told the Sunflower, because the check was \u201cpresented by someone named Sattar Ali, not James or Robert.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Wichita not welcome any foreigners? Then tell us. Be up front and forward with people and say, \u2018You are not welcome in our city,\u2019\u201d he added, according to KAKE.\n\nHe was also confused as to why the bank couldn\u2019t verify the check but police managed to. It was later reported that the bank did not, in fact, call Dearborn to verify the check, but instead for some reason placed a call to Boise, Idaho, KAKE notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmprise, for its part, appears to be unrepentant, issuing a statement claiming, \u201cWe are aware of a situation at the 21st and Woodlawn branch yesterday and can confirm that our team acted in accordance with our policies and procedures. If faced with the same circumstances today, we would expect our team to take the same actions.\u201d\n\nAli, who originally lived in Wichita from 1999 to 2008, told the Sunflower that this was the first time he ever felt unwelcome.\n\n\u201cI would expect this in the 1950s. Not now,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel sad for me.

He owed a total of $12,203\u2014the original $10,000 he was given plus a 28 percent penalty the department assessed for having to collect the money from him in the first place\u2014and the agency was going to begin garnishing his wages to get the money.\n\nThe Treasury Department said it had tried unsuccessfully to contact him about the debt in 2013 but got no response after sending mail to at least two different addresses it had for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFEMA decided that the funds that they gave me, I was ineligible for,\u201d Allen told WUSA9. \u201cI lived through Hurricane Katrina, but I\u2019m ineligible for these funds.

I don\u2019t even understand how they just arbitrarily chose this.\u201d\n\nAllen was told that he was ineligible for the funds he had received, but he was not given a reason as to why he has been deemed ineligible. When neither FEMA nor the Treasury Department could give him a straight answer, he turned to WUSA9.\n\nInvestigative reporter Erik Flack began making phone calls on his behalf, and eventually, FEMA arranged for Allen to receive a phone call on a Friday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was on that call that Allen learned that he was considered ineligible for the funds because FEMA was not supposed to have given funds to college students who applied through the method he used. To put it another way, Allen unwittingly used the wrong application process, and FEMA did not catch the error, but now that it has, he is being penalized for it.\n\nTo make matters worse, because FEMA had already transferred the debt to collections, Allen could not appeal the finding.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, FEMA sent a statement to WUSA9 that read: \u201cFEMA reviews disaster-assistance payments to ensure those payments have been properly awarded and appropriately spent. Whether through human or accounting errors, duplication of benefits, fraud, or other reasons, assistance sometimes goes to individuals who are not eligible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWUSA9 reports that while FEMA did not respond to questions about how often this type of thing happens, federal oversight offices say improper and potentially fraudulent payments after Katrina total between $600 million and $1.4 billion.\n\nFEMA told Congress in a 2011 report that it has put in a new system of checks and balances that has drastically reduced the problem of improper payments.\n\nRead more at WTSP 10 News.", "keywords": ["mans", "told", "allen", "department", "used", "hurricane", "given", "funds", "wusa9", "garnishing", "fema", "agency", "check", "katrina", "ineligible", "treasury"], "polarity": 0.023607503607503598, "subjectivity": 0.38295093795093793},

The Hollywood Reporter explains:\n\nWith negotiations for the fifth season ongoing, sources say Ellis Ross feels that if she isn\u2019t brought up to Anderson\u2019s level, she may opt to appear in fewer episodes to make up the disparity by guesting on another show. The tactic has split opinions within Time\u2019s Up, with some worried that it\u2019s more a retreat than a forward-looking solution (fitting in extra work isn\u2019t always feasible, and often an actress wouldn\u2019t earn as much guesting as she would as a network star). A network source says a new deal will significantly increase her compensation and cautioned that Anderson and Ellis Ross\u2019 roles aren\u2019t equal given that he has been attached to Black-ish from the start and is an executive producer. Still, until a few weeks ago, this type of candid conversation would never have taken place outside an actress\u2019 agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unclear what \u201csignificantly less\u201d means, but another egregious example discussed at the Time\u2019s Up table was the pay difference between actress Michelle Williams and her co-star, Mark Wahlberg, for their recent film All the Money in the World. In that case, Wahlberg was paid nearly 10 times more than Williams, taking home $5 million, compared with Williams\u2019 $625,000.\n\nThat Ross\u2019 pay gap with Anderson was brought up in the same conversation could mean they\u2019re facing a similarly severe pay disparity.\n\nBoth Ross and Anderson have starred on Black-ish since the show started running on ABC in 2014, and have received multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for their work on the series. Of the two, however, Ross is the only one to have taken home an award. In 2016 she became the first black woman in 35 years to win a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical TV series.", "keywords": ["hollywood", "significantly", "equal", "laughs", "anderson", "pay", "paid", "ross", "tracee", "blackish", "reveals", "actress", "williams", "gap", "times", "timesup", "meeting"], "polarity": 0.14481951871657753, "subjectivity": 0.40148172905525853},

Kotb, who was called on to sub for Matt Lauer after allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse prompted NBC to fire him, was given the title of co-anchor permanently on Tuesday. The news was warmly received by her colleagues at NBC and fans of the show.\n\nBut according to the New York Post\u2019s Page Six, Kotb will be earning about a third of what Lauer made. The outlet reports that Kotb\u2019s annual salary will be around $7 million, on par with Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie.\n\nLauer earned between $20 million and $25 million each year between 2012 and 2017. Enough to cover the salaries of Guthrie, Kotb and an additional host.\n\nSome industry experts say that this is a necessary deflation. From the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nLauer\u2019s high salary stemmed from his star presence and decades of service for the highly lucrative morning show. \u201cThis is a symptom of the correct economic decision to downsize the role and not throw millions and millions of dollars at it,\u201d says independent news analyst and frequent THR contributor Andrew Tyndall, speculating that Kotb could make roughly $5 million a year in her new role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCorrect economic decision\u201d is certainly an interesting way of putting it. Kotb has been with NBC News for 20 years, and the Today show for 10. She has over-performed in her role, making the 10 o\u2019clock hour she co-hosted with Kathie Lee Gifford so popular that, according to Variety, NBC for a time \u201coffered repeats of it during overnight hours.\u201d\n\nKotb\u2019s presence proved pivotal in managing NBC\u2019s self-inflicted crisis following Lauer\u2019s departure. Kotb and Guthrie steered Today to its highest ratings of 2017, surpassing its main rival, ABC\u2019s Good Morning America, for the first time in nearly a year.\n\nLauer\u2019s \u201cstar presence,\u201d it turns out, had actually been a black hole.\n\nEver the team player, Kotb has been doing some heavy lifting for the show since taking over for the alleged sexual predator who preceded her. Kotb will co-host the top of the Today show with Guthrie, from 7-9 a.m., and then return at 10 a.m. with Gifford. As Page Six reports, during that hour \u201cbreak,\u201d Kotb will record updates for the West Coast and other video before returning to the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Megyn Kelly remains the most highly paid and most underwhelming host on NBC\u2019s morning docket, commanding $20 million a year to make her guests uncomfortable as hell and pretend that neither she nor her former employer was racist.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that Kotb\u2019s good news is being overshadowed by NBC (over-)correcting its poor economic decisions, but this is the reality many women of color face across various industries in the U.S.: Even when we land the dream job, the salary gap is still a nightmare.", "keywords": ["morning", "guthrie", "earn", "nbc", "sexual", "predator", "fraction", "million", "presence", "coanchor", "alleged", "economic", "today", "hoda", "preceded", "salary", "kotb"], "polarity": 0.17767970401691333, "subjectivity": 0.48749823819591265},

I\u2019ll be honest, I turned it off about 30 minutes after the red carpet fashion show - Neil Patrick Harris joked about how white the audience was and everyone laughed at acknowledging their privilege in a way that was too \u201cyes I\u2019m an asshole but at least I know it\u201d for my taste, so I decided to read Issa Rae\u2019s new book instead.\n\nNot to be too out of touch with the social media zeitgeist, however, I woke up this morning and went online to scan the biggest highlights of the evening. I rolled my eyes at Wes Anderson being rewarded for his Wes Anderson-iness, found myself stirred by the performance of \u201cGlory\u201d while simultaneously amused by Common\u2019s newly minted orchestra conductor rap hands (when are we going to admit that besides John Legend\u2019s hook and bridge, this song is just mediocre? Look up the lyrics and get back to me), and started furiously moisturizing my face when pictures of Lupita came across my screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also read Patricia Arquette\u2019s contribution to social justice and groaned out loud.\n\nPatricia Arquette won Best Supporting Actress for Boyhood \u2013 a movie which, as far as I can tell, is about that oft-untold story of growing up as a middle class White male in suburban America \u2013 and used her acceptance speech to champion equal pay for women, which elicited a church stomp from the audience. And, for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t understand why Arquette\u2019s statement was being viewed as so groundbreaking.\n\nEqual pay for women is not an unacknowledged issue in America. We have a President who consistently acknowledges the wage gap and signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as one of his first acts of his Presidency. The phrase \u201cLean In\u201d has been sprayed on social media like confetti for the past two years \u2013 to the point that Jessica Williams of The Daily Show was forced to defend her statement that she wasn\u2019t qualified to transition into hosting the show post Jon Stewart\u2019s retirement. And frankly, the reason why the wage gap is still so wide is largely due to the disparities for women of color. Black and Hispanic women get 64 and 56 cents on the dollar respectively \u2013 but I guess Ms. Arquette didn\u2019t have time to point that part out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe did have time to elaborate on her statements after the awards ceremony, however, saying the following:\n\n\u201cIt's time for all the women in America and all the men that love women, and all the gay people, and all the people of color that we've all fought for to fight for us now.\u201d\n\nPut down your #BlackLivesMatter t-shirts everyone! The fights for both Black and LGBTQ civil rights are apparently over and it\u2019s White women\u2019s time to shine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is it that she thinks Women of Color do, exactly? I don\u2019t assume that Patricia Arquette has read all things Audre Lorde, but she does realize that there are women who are Black and maybe even queer who fight on several of these fronts? Why does she think that Black women have been getting more and more advanced degrees at a higher rate than our male counterparts? They certainly don\u2019t keep us warm at night.\n\nThe biggest rub of all is not just her assumption that intersectionality is a nonexistent thing and POCs don\u2019t fight for feminist issues every day; it\u2019s that in 2015 marginalized minority groups are in any position of power to exact change to help the prestigious Hollywood families of the world negotiate more equitable Sony contracts.\n\nThe next time someone asks me why Black Feminism and Intersectionality are distinct groups and efforts in the Women\u2019s Rights Movement, I\u2019m just going to refer them to Patricia Arquette\u2019s words. I was unaware that we owed White women for Civil Rights, much less Patricia Arquette, who I\u2019ve never seen utter the words Trayvon or Michael Brown. I understand that Ms. Arquette may identify as a woman first, but to demand that other marginalized communities stand beside you at the expense of their other struggles that pose just as much of an imposition on their day to day life and ability to progress in society is a level of conceit that is as mindboggling as\u2026well, as making a movie a week every year for twelve years just to say you did it.", "keywords": ["feminism", "white", "oscarssowhite", "read", "pay", "patricia", "fight", "women", "arquette", "rights", "translucent", "social", "black"], "polarity": 0.10283438783438782, "subjectivity": 0.34581141081141087},

Asked by Gordon how she feels seeing the video of her nephew\u2019s shooting replayed over and over, she said, \u201cit\u2019s like I died every day with him for 365 days.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon told the audience when the afternoon session began that he knew of the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d in the room\u2014Newman\u2019s scheduled appearance. He urged \u201ca little decorum,\u201d and declared that no stipulation had been placed on him stating what he could ask. Gordon said that Newman had requested not to appear by herself and would join a group discussion.\n\nNewman entered to polite applause after a second panel was introduced that included retired Los Angeles Police Sgt. Cheryl Dorsey, author of \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d; political analyst Jason Johnson of Morgan State University, who is also political editor of TheRoot.com; Arthur \u201cSilky Slim\u201d Reed, a former gang leader now a motivational speaker, and BuzzFeed writer Joel Anderson.\n\nNewman said she wanted to talk about the impact of losing relatives to violence, saying that most people \u201cjust don\u2019t know me.\u201d But was not long before Gordon turned the conversation to Trump. Newman tried in vain to return to the subject of slain relatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Adrian Carrasquillo, Anderson and Darren Sands reported for BuzzFeed, \u201cAsked specifically about Trump\u2019s recent comments suggesting police officers should be rougher with suspects and if she spoke to the president about what he said, Manigault said that she would not \u2018disclose confidential conversations\u2019 with Trump, but that she has invited law enforcement to the White House to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not going to stand here and defend everything about Donald Trump,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs she fended off questions about Trump, Manigault at one point accused the moderator of being \u2018aggressive,\u2019 took the microphone and decided to stand up and walk the stage. . . .\u201d\n\nGordon, too, became more animated, insisting that questions about Trump were fair game and asking whether Newman was aware of \u201cthe depth of feeling\u201d against the president among African Americans when he makes such statements as his July 28 remarks to Long Island, N.Y., law enforcement officers. When arresting \u201cthese thugs,\u201d Trump said then, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too nice.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers around the country denounced the statement, and the White House responded that Trump was joking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewman told Gordon that nothing she said would appease him, and asked whether the panel had become simply a dialogue between the two of them.\n\nShe also said, \u201cno black boy should be treated the way Freddie Gray was, or any of these other young men were treated,\u201d referring to the 25-year-old Baltimore man who died in police custody in 2015.\n\nAsked for his response, Reed said, \u201cfirst of all, Freddie Gray was not a boy . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressed for her own responses to such deaths, Newman advised the audience to Google \u201cEric Garner\u201d and her own name.\n\n\u201cLook for yourselves,\u201d she said. The suggestion was met with groans.\n\nAlong the way, three, then four, five, six and finally eight audience members stood with their backs to those on stage. Others walked out. The BuzzFeed report said, \u201cBrittany Packnett \u2014 a Ferguson protester who rose to prominence inside the Black Lives Matter movement as a part of the policy group Campaign Zero, and a well-respected activist on race, justice, and policing \u2014 was among the less than ten protesters who stood with their backs to Manigault as she spoke. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Gordon asked whether the White House was aware of \u201cthe anger that some of us feel,\u201d Newman replied, \u201cI think they see it. We\u2019re very keen on that,\u201d and noted that the administration had invited civil rights leaders, the Congressional Black Caucus and other African Americans to come to the White House. The Congressional Black Caucus has refused.\n\nRep. Cedric Richman, D-La., the Caucus chair, told NABJ\u2019s opening session on Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to the White House for a social gathering.\u201d He wrote to constituents in June, \u201cWe gave the administration a 130 page document. No Response. We sent 8 letters. No Response. We have had zero meetings with cabinet secretaries.\u201d\n\nAnd when he [Trump] didn\u2019t take us seriously, we declined a second meeting. Because we have to get his attention.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewman said at the panel discussion, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t come to the table, decisions are made whether you\u2019re at the table or not.\u201d\n\nEventually, Newman left the stage.\n\nGlover stood in front of the audience to explain that NABJ felt obligated to to invite members of the Trump administration to the convention, that Newman had accepted and that Friday was the only day she was available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon, still on stage, replied that organizers had discussed Newman\u2019s appearance for an hour and a half and that \u201cit would be foolhardy to assume that we would sit here and not ask certain questions.\n\n\u201cLet us close this out. I\u2019ll see you at the White House Christmas party in December,\u201d Gordon concluded, raising his fist.\n\nNABJ issued this statement:\n\n\u201cAs an organization of professional journalists, NABJ seeks to have candid and frank conversations with newsmakers. For years, the NABJ has invited the White House administration to partake in the annual convention. We appreciate that the Director of Communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison Omarosa Newman is participating this year and has come to share her perspective on issues that are critical to our members, and moreover, critical to the communities that we serve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannah-Jones, who watched the proceedings from the audience rather than the moderator\u2019s perch, told Journal-isms as she left the discussion, \u201cYou can see that I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nCobb wrote on Facebook, \u201cA man does not grow up on the South Side of Queens in the crack era without learning to recognize a set-up when he sees one.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated, \u201cUnder other circumstances, maybe. But NABJ was talking some craziness about her being there as someone who has been impacted by violence, not as a member of the administration. So it wasn\u2019t even clear we would actually get to discuss anything important. More likely it was going to devolve into precisely the kind of fiasco that wound up happening. So basically, the idea was to get people with good standing in the community and reputations for doing serious work and drag them into a gutter of ad hominem insults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can play the dozens with the best of them (Drew Hall, 87-88) but not in my professional setting, not when I\u2019m sitting next to the grieving mothers of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, not when we\u2019re dealing with an ignorant administration that has used insult and distraction to its advantage so shamelessly. And not when I\u2019m there with someone whose whole agenda is to turn a serious forum into reality TV.\u201d\n\nAt the annual NABJ business meeting earlier Friday, Glover and Shirley Carswell, interim executive director, announced that the convention had attracted 3,289 registrants, an unaudited Thursday figure, of which 2,554 were paid. The figure tops last year\u2019s 3,225.\n\nGregory Lee, Finance Committee chair, reported:\n\n\u201cNABJ total revenue $3,407,000 an increase of 63% from the previous year.\n\n\u201cNABJ expenses were down 15% percent from the previous year.\n\n\u201cConvention registration was $830,001, an increase of 86% from the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConvention sponsorship was $1,310,432, an increase of 60% from the previous year.\n\n\u201cWith the 2016 victory in hand, the committee submitted a series of recommendations to help set up the association with its over $1.2 million dollars in excess revenue for the year.\u201d\n\nMichael Days, NABJ Hall of Fame acceptance speech (prepared remarks) (Comments section)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSebastian Murdock, Taryn Finley, HuffPost BlackVoices: Omarosa Tells NABJ Convention She \u2018Fights On Front Lines Every Day\u2019 To Laughs, Groans\n\nRochelle Riley: \u201cWe must all channel the spirit of Ida B.

(Shoutout to Issa and Molly!) Black women\u2019s friendship is more than boozy brunches, epic catfights and screaming \u201cYasss Queen\u201d to one another. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014all of these are small elements of our bonds\u2014but to fully capture and re-create the sisterhood of black girls\u2019 friendships, you need limitless talent.\n\nGirls Trip has just that, from the star-studded ensemble cast\u2014Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Regina Hall and Tiffany Haddish\u2014to the film\u2019s director, Malcolm D. Lee, and producer (and 2016 The Root 100 honoree) Will Packer.\n\nGirls Trip comes out Friday, and it\u2019s about time! We\u2019ve been patiently waiting (to exhale) since 1995 (when Waiting to Exhale was released) for a beautiful group of black female friends who love and support one another, despite all of life\u2019s ills, as a plotline in a major motion picture.\n\n\n\nIn order to fully understand this movie\u2019s stretch beyond a black female version of The Hangover, you\u2019ve got to understand that Girls Trip\u2019s director and producer are geniuses in bringing out simple, yet compelling human nature in their characters.\n\nFirst, let me tell you about the subtle complexities of each character:\n\nSasha: Queen Latifah plays this bad-and-boujee journalist who found her way into the gossip-blogging world and is finding it hard to keep up appearances and page views. Queen plays Sasha with integrity and a stubborn vulnerability that makes you root for her throughout the movie. Her friendship means something, but she holds on to hurt because she wants those who have wronged her to acknowledge their wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan: Regina Hall plays this cookie-cutter, have-it-all, best-selling author, trophy wife and heir to Oprah\u2019s throne. Ryan is married to the thick chocolate brother Stewart Pierce (played by Mike Colter, whom we all know from Luke Cage). Well, he\u2019s no hero in this movie, and Ryan is torn between maintaining her picture-perfect image or living happily ever after in an unplanned way. Hall\u2019s character means well but is often misguided by her own decisions.\n\nDina: Tiffany Haddish\u2019s may be the most hilarious character in this movie. She steals every single scene she is in with her raunchy humor and one-liners. But there\u2019s something refreshing about Haddish\u2019s character. She\u2019s the type of woman you\u2019d kill to have as a friend because honestly, she\u2019d kill for you. She\u2019s the definition of ride-or-die and never spares her friends from brutal honesty. She\u2019s a lot of things, but one thing she is not is a bad friend.\n\nLisa: Jada Pinkett Smith plays the resident mother hen of the group. She\u2019s the type to wear a full-length, hand-embroidered Guatemalan skirt to the club. She\u2019s a single mother who dotes on her two young children way too much and lives with her mother. Lisa is clearly all about family, and that is something she takes into her friendships. She\u2019s conservative, kind and in real need of all the deliciousness that is Kofi Siriboe, who plays her young buck, Malik.\n\nTogether, these women make up the \u201cFlossy Posse.\u201d Sasha, Ryan, Dina and Lisa went to college together and vowed to continue their friendship long after they received their degrees. They meet up for their \u201cgirls trips\u201d as often as they can, but the Essence Festival trip from the movie is evidently after the Flossy Posse\u2019s meet-ups have dwindled down. This reconnection is important to the foursome, and so is each character\u2019s growth throughout the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the movie relies on laughter to carry it, you can tell that the characters have been tenderly cared for. Each woman is a full person, complete with dualities in her personality. Lisa is a perfect doting mother, but it takes just a little convincing (from Dina) to get her to let young Malik give her all the sexual healing her body\u2019s been craving. And you think that Ryan is never going to let go of her flawless image, but eventually she does. Sasha somehow avoids the one shady and lucrative action that could save her blog, and watching her character grow through moral and financial dilemmas is exhausting, but may even remind you of your own journey to being a better person. And Dina\u2014well, she never changes, but honestly, her beautifully ratchet character doesn\u2019t need to. Be warned: Her moments are the raunchiest and the funniest, but so worth it.\n\n\n\nThis movie is everything you think it is: a beautiful display of black not cracking on the faces of these stressed-out, middle-aged women who allow themselves an unadulterated weekend in sultry New Orleans during Essence Festival. Obviously the group\u2019s wild card, Dina gets them into more trouble than they know how to get out of (thank God for Larenz Tate\u2014who plays Julian Stevens\u2014a musician-turned-heartthrob for one of the women. He\u2019s a knight in shining armor), which is what makes the movie swim along in such hilarious fun that there\u2019s hardly a moment without sidesplitting laughter.\n\nLee and Packer capture the unbreakable bonds of black women\u2019s friendships. This special connection, despite the trials, is strong enough to take on infidelity, truth telling (over sparing feelings) and those all-too-real, I\u2019m-sick-of-your-shit moments that end a lot of fragile friendships. No doubt, black women strive in a world that doesn\u2019t support us the way we support it. I\u2019ve watched my own friends lift up people, places and things that have done nothing but tear them down. The hearts of black women are large and capable of that type of love for what doesn\u2019t always love us back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to see each of these characters love each other hard was just the type of refreshment we needed the silver screen to bless us with. Yes, you are going to see Girls Trip because you wanted to laugh till you cried, and you will, but you\u2019ll also get to leave the theater with a full heart. You\u2019ll also likely want to call up your girls and plan the next trip.

I thanked her without smiling as she led me to the bright cell with cornflower-colored bars where I would stay until I was summoned once more to be fingerprinted. I wondered how the woman in the cell across from mine could sleep, curled up in a fetuslike ball. She seemed oblivious to the goings-on around her.\n\n\n\nI was still in my cocktail dress and stiletto heels, my makeup fresh. My left arm felt tender, a result of having an officer squeeze it tightly as he led me, handcuffed, to the squad car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat are you in here for?\u201d a young Asian woman in the same cell as the snoring woman asked.\n\n\u201cViolation of the noise ordinance. I was having a birthday party for a friend,\u201d I replied. She, along with the four other women waiting to be processed, was in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I insisted.\n\n\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d a young black woman with sweatpants and a T-shirt inquired.\n\n\u201cIn Chevy Chase,\u201d I answered. She began to shake her head, and I knew why.\n\nThe Barnaby Woods neighborhood of Chevy Chase in Washington, D.C., is a heavily Democratic, progressive enclave known for its walkability and lush greenery. It is also the neighborhood chosen by Vice President Mike Pence to live before he moved into the vice president\u2019s mansion. In an act of resistance, residents hung rainbow flags and placed signs in their yards proclaiming their commitment to inclusivity and diversity. In that moment, I felt proud to belong to a community that seemed to be on the right side of history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe neighborhood, while progressive, is not racially diverse, with about 10 percent of the population African American or other people of color. It is also the wealthiest zip code in the city. Most African Americans in the city reside in wards 7 or 8, across the Anacostia River, where poverty rates hover above 30 percent. I am one of only a handful of black people in the neighborhood.\n\nI chose Barnaby Woods because of its top-ranked public elementary school. I have 7-year-old twins and was not interested in competing for the too few slots available for decent schools in the citywide lottery. Finding a home here felt like such a boon.\n\nOn Sunday night, I hosted a milestone birthday party for a dear friend whom I have known for more than a decade. She also recently landed a big job as a senior vice president at a prestigious firm. Long-ago friends had flown in from across the country to celebrate with us. The party began in earnest at 9:30 p.m., and by 10:45 p.m., a little more than an hour later, I was arrested and in a squad car headed down to the 2nd District precinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police officers, one white and the other black, responded to a noise complaint from my neighbors. When I came to the door, I noticed the demeanor of the white officer right away. He was not friendly. I believed that he was surprised that it was I, an African-American woman, who had come to the door.\n\nThe officer proceeded to let me know that I was in violation of the noise ordinance that had begun about 15 minutes prior to his arrival at 10:15 p.m. He asked me to turn off the music. The second sentence out of his mouth was, \u201cYou can be arrested for this.\u201d He then returned to his squad car. I worked frantically with another guest to turn the music down and to research the noise ordinance.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of waiting at the foot of my driveway, the white officer returned to my porch and arrested me for violating the noise ordinance. I was silent. I knew what could happen to me if I asked a question or refused to go. Immediately I thought of Sandra Bland, the black woman pulled over for a routine traffic shot in Texas who, days later, was found dead in her jail cell; the young girl, also in Texas, who was assaulted by a police officer while attending a pool party; and the high schooler in South Carolina who was manhandled by a school safety officer while sitting at her desk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could be beaten or, even worse, killed. And it would be my fault. My fear was justified. I also thought about my children, who were away at a slumber party, and how panicked they would feel if I failed to pick them up the following morning.\n\n\n\nWhen my friends\u2014doctors, lawyers and other professionals in their best clothes\u2014gathered in the driveway to inquire about why he was arresting me, the white officer refused to respond and replied only that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to listen to this.\u201d He scrambled into his squad car, but not before hitting one of the guests with the door as he slammed it shut. Before I was placed in the car, the music had been turned completely off.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, we all felt hopeless and helpless. We were the \u201cgood\u201d blacks. We had all done the right thing: gone to college, purchased homes and had outstanding careers. We followed the rules. I am the first in my family to graduate from high school, attend college and earn a Ph.D. If there was, in the words of W.E.B. Du Bois, a Talented Tenth, we were among them. However, none of that mattered.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I arrived at the police station, I was left handcuffed in the squad car. Both of the arresting officers got out of the car and huddled by the precinct door. Before I knew it, a visibly frustrated sergeant appeared and asked pointedly why I had been arrested and not just given a citation or ticket. The officers had no answer.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent history of the noise ordinance, there have been no arrests in the Barnaby Woods neighborhood under similar circumstances. While I was being fingerprinted, the black female officer told me that in all of her 29 years on the force, she had never seen anyone arrested for violation of the noise ordinance.\n\n\n\nBack at my home, although there was no music, the police continued to harass the remaining guests. The officers refused to leave the scene until they were told to do so by a higher commanding officer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I was released a couple of hours later, I was welcomed with smiling faces by a group of friends who had been dispatched from the party to make sure I was OK. On the drive home, I hoped that the party was still carrying on. It was. When I entered the house, there was a collective sigh of relief. I was seemingly unharmed and in good spirits. However, I was rattled to my core.\n\n\n\nWhat I know to be true is that although I have managed to achieve a certain measure of personal and professional success, I have never been fooled into believing I was above the dehumanizing treatment and suspicion often visited upon black people regardless of class or education. Through marked and sometimes painful experiences of racism, I understand plainly what it means to be black in America and to be robbed of human dignity, not only for what you have failed to achieve because of institutional and structural racism, but also for what you\u2019ve been able to achieve despite these prejudices.\n\n\n\nThat night, I chose to celebrate despite feeling dehumanized and powerless. I would not let them steal my joy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see you, Serena Williams, LeBron James, Gabby Sidibe, Forest Whitaker and Colin Kaepernick. We already know what is.\n\nC.

However, a new report now indicates that researchers from San Diego State University who helped with the report softened their language a great deal while writing some of the results, and even removed some of the findings entirely.\n\nAccording to the Voice of San Diego, when addressing the overarching question of whether officers and the Police Department as a whole showed racial bias, San Diego State researchers acknowledged that there were differences in the way minority motorists and white motorists were treated. But researchers also added that those differences \u201care by no means unique to the SDPD,\u201d noting that the findings only \u201csuggest\u201d that implicit bias \u201cmay exist\u201d among officers.\n\nHowever, when the Voice of San Diego obtained draft copies of the study from San Diego State, the findings were, in fact, more pointed. According to the report, city officials had attempted to stop the drafts from being released publicly, saying that the disclosure \u201cwould likely increase community tension and discontent.\u201d (Of course, any signs of a cover-up would not have had the same effect, I\u2019m sure.)\n\nIn comparing the draft copy with the final version released to the City Council, the Voice of San Diego found that some of the harsher language had been softened and some findings were completely removed. The changes included the following:\n\n\u2022 In more than two-dozen instances, the word \u201cbias\u201d was replaced with \u201cdisparities.\u201d \u2022 An early draft recommended the department stop making traffic stops for minor violations unrelated to public safety, and instead simply issue citations by mail\u2014something, researchers noted, other departments are exploring. \u2022 Also cut from the final draft was the finding, via police survey, that the majority of officers felt they wouldn\u2019t benefit from additional training in fair and impartial policing. \u2022 The final version of the study found that black drivers were more likely than white drivers to be stopped in only one of the San Diego Police Department\u2019s nine divisions, northeastern, which includes the largely white neighborhoods of Mira Mesa, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos and Scripps Ranch. A draft version reached a different conclusion, finding evidence of racial disparities in three divisions, not just one, and, in aggregate, all police divisions located north of Interstate 8, often considered to be San Diego\u2019s racial and economic dividing line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Voice of San Diego notes that, regarding the last finding, the study\u2019s lead researcher, Joshua Chanin, professor of public affairs at SDSU, said the change was made because researchers opted to use a different threshold to determine whether a finding was statistically significant. Initially, researchers considered a finding statistically significant if there was at least a 90 percent chance that it was true, but they later changed that threshold to 95 percent.\n\nIn the Northern Division of the Police Department, the likelihood that racial disparities in traffic stops weren\u2019t just by chance was about 93.4 percent, while in the Southeastern Division it was 92.3 percent, and for all of the divisions located above the Interstate 8 divide, it was 94.2 percent.\n\nA draft of the study provided to the city on Oct. 27 noted, \u201c[O]ur analysis of combined stops from all five divisions above Interstate 8 shows that when compared to Whites, Black drivers are 15 percent more likely to be stopped during daylight hours, when driver race is visible, than after dark, when driver race is obscured.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, by the time the final draft rolled around, the finding read as follows: \u201cAnalysis of the aggregated data from [divisions north of I-8] shows no statistically significant difference in the daylight-darkness stop patterns of Black and White drivers.\u201d\n\nChanin said that the intent was to provide a study in which the findings were \u201cunassailable\u201d by the city and the Police Department, and that the 95 percent threshold is considered a standard in scientific research, the Voice of San Diego notes.\n\nHe also stated that the research team thought that the edits were necessary in order to get the Police Department to take the study seriously. However, City Councilman David Alvarez told the site that he wished researchers had found a way to explain that some of the findings were almost within the threshold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more important when you\u2019re dealing with the public who aren\u2019t statisticians and who need to get a narrative and a description of what the findings were because that\u2019s how you\u2019re transparent about information,\u201d the councilman said.\n\nIn an earlier draft of the study, researchers recommended that the Police Department cut back on using traffic stops for equipment violations such as broken brake lights or tinted windows, as a means of improving community relations and officer safety.\n\n\u201cWe note that other police departments are currently in the process of reconsidering their approach to traffic stops in this way by directing officers to focus on the violations most related to safety, such as speeding and the running of red lights,\u201d the draft noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers also recommended that officers just record the car\u2019s license plate number and suggested that the department implement a system to give the driver a warning or \u201cfix-it\u201d ticket through the mail.\n\nHowever, the department turned up its nose at that recommendation, according to what Chanin told the Voice of San Diego, and then researchers were left with the choice of whether to keep a recommendation that would have been ignored or to cut it to \u201cfoster goodwill and enable some of the other [changes] that we felt were possibilities.\u201d\n\nChanin claims that this was the only major change made in response to pressure from the city, adding that regardless of any changes made between versions, \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence in this report that there is a difference in the way that black and brown people are treated that whites.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Voice of San Diego.", "keywords": ["report", "draft", "researchers", "used", "removed", "department", "study", "voice", "likely", "finding", "diego", "racial", "watereddown", "language", "profiling", "findings", "san"], "polarity": 0.08382760532150775, "subjectivity": 0.4872021609826488},

Why should you care about this? Well, Rybka also claims to be able to connect all of the dots missing from the Russia investigation and President Donald J. Trump. Rybka was recently arrested and thrown into a Thai jail and now, most likely because she\u2019s been arrested and cut off from her Russian money source, she\u2019s ready to spill all the tea.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am ready to tell you about all those jigsaw puzzles you were missing, to support it with audio, video, regarding the connection between our \u2018dear\u2019 parliament members with [former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort, Trump and all this \u2018buzz\u2019 around the election in the USA,\u201d said Rybka, who appeared to be riding around in a caged vehicle, USA Today reports. \u201cI know a lot. Therefore, I shall wait for your offers, and I wait in the Thai prison.\u201d\n\nWait, I\u2019m completely confused. Rybka is locked up in a Thai prison and is riding around in a caged vehicle, most likely a prison-transport vehicle, but she still has her phone and access to her Instagram account?\n\nAlso, instead of asking for help, she\u2019s offering to sell her story to whomever can get her out of prison. If it weren\u2019t for this divisive administration and this backward-ass president, I would chalk up Rybka\u2019s missive as the desperate pleas of a Russian thot, but I hate this administration so much I am tempted to start a GoFundMe account in her honor. Oh, and then there is this:\n\n\u201cIf we go back to Russia we will die in Russian\u2019s prison or they will kill us,\u201d she wrote Tuesday on her Instagram account. \u201cPlease USA help us not to die from Russians!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRybka was arrested along with nine other Russians who claimed to be sex experts running a course on lovemaking, which I guess is illegal in Thailand.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Deripaska was a business associate of former Trump campaign manager Manafort and hired him starting in 2006 to influence American politics to benefit Russia. The contract stipulated $10 million a year for Manafort\u2019s services.\n\nWhile Rybka could potentially have the goods to sink this torturous administration\u2019s bootleg dingy, Rybka also admits to making shit up from time to time, USA Today reports. But she has provided receipts to back up part of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how USA Today recounts bits of her memoir, Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, in which she writes about galavanting with top Russian officials, a tome that\u2019s been cited by Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and critic of President Vladimir Putin:\n\nNavalny used Rybka\u2019s memoir Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, her social media postings and geolocation techniques to show that she spent time in August 2016 on Deripaska\u2019s yacht off the coast of Norway. She had claimed in her book that the cruise was off the coast of Greenland. Photos on her Instagram account, @natya_rybka.ru, showed her on the navy blue, teak-decked Elden with Deripaska. They also showed Deripaska there with Sergei Prikhodko, who\u2019s described on the Russian government\u2019s website as deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeripaska posted a statement to Instagram on Feb. 9 claiming that he\u2019s never done anything wrong and plans to defend his \u201chonor and dignity\u201d in court. Prikhodko also suggested to the Russian newspaper RBK Daily that he would like to fight Navalny, but promised to \u201cremain within the legal framework,\u201d USA Today reports.\n\n\n\nSo who\u2019s going to spring to get the Russian call girl out of Thai jail? Do the Bernie bros want in on this?

I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people.

Black women were paid 63 percent of that amount.\n\nDamn.\n\nThese statistics are proof that we need a circle of sistah-friends like Wanda to confirm when we\u2019re being lowballed and to teach us how to proceed when we\u2019re offered paltry pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, today\u2019s Hollywood is filled with examples of sistah-friends who are making BOSS money moves and helping each other do the same. We know many of them\u2014well, at least we think we do\u2014since we follow them on social media:\n\nShonda and Viola\n\nMega TV producer Shonda Rhimes is intent on helping women garner the jobs and money they\u2019re due. When Rhimes courted actress Viola Davis to play Annalise Keating in How to Get Away With Murder\u2014a role that has secured her both Emmy and SAG Award wins\u2014Rhimes is credited with asking Davis \u201cWhat do you need to be happy?\u201d Apparently, $250,000 an episode (the salary Davis now reportedly receives) was enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhimes is no stranger to asking for what she needs to be happy. According to Forbes, the writer-producer makes more than $10 million a year in her deal with ABC, not including lucrative back-end fees from syndication or licensing.\n\nOprah and Ava\n\nOprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay are another sistah squad where each member uses her individual clout to support and uplift the other. Now, granted, Oprah doesn\u2019t need anybody to uplift her\u2014she\u2019s richer than Black Jesus. But still, their dynamic partnership\u2014Oprah starring in Selma and DuVernay\u2019s upcoming film, A Wrinkle In Time, and Ava creating Queen Sugar for the Oprah Winfrey Network\u2014is #SquadGoals. Let\u2019s also remember that Oprah is famous for advising up-and-coming black entertainers about how to manage their coins: \u201cSign your own checks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanda Sykes is only one of a few heavy hitters who are publicly disclosing their \u201cpaltry\u201d paychecks. In a recently leaked meeting, Tracee Ellis Ross revealed that she makes \u201csignificantly less\u201d than Black-ish co-star Anthony Anderson.\n\nAs actress Jada Pinkett Smith recently tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Hollywood\u2019s black leading ladies are being shafted, then how much more are we being undervalued and underpaid overall?\n\nTime\u2019s truly up on us being lowballed or, worse\u2014lowballing ourselves.\n\nAfter I left my full-time job three years ago, I learned a disturbing fact: As a director, I had been paid the same salary as a colleague who was a manager. I was two promotions ahead of her, a few years her senior; heck\u2014I had helped train her when she was an intern. Yet we made the same amount.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly I realized that I should have ignored my boss\u2019s encouragement to keep my salary a secret. Every time I received a slight pay raise, she made it seem as if she had advocated for me, and advised me not to discuss it with my colleagues, for fear that they would become jealous.\n\nToday I recognize that my pay increases were minuscule compared with what I could have received. But I didn\u2019t realize it then, because I never talked money with my co-workers. I chose to operate within the siloed American work culture that silences discussions about pay.\n\nAs a freelance writer, I\u2019ve struggled with owning my worth and demanding commensurate financial compensation. Two years ago, a publication invited me to become a regular contributor. I asked my community of women writers what to charge. They suggested rates, standard industry rates, but the rates felt too high to me. I quoted the editor 55 percent less than what my peers suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s very doable,\u201d I immediately knew that I had lowballed myself. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t think that my work warranted the higher rate. In other words, I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\n\nArguably more than any other group, we as black women must fearlessly advocate for our paychecks, and it begins with the belief in our worth.\n\nAfter Viola Davis received her best actress Oscar, she surprisingly admitted to struggling with self-doubt. \u201cI still have the imposter syndrome,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cSome days, I wake up and think, \u2018Everybody\u2019s gonna see me for the hack that I am \u2026 until I realize that I do know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe does know what she\u2019s doing.\n\nWe do, too.\n\nTo become the staunch advocates that our paychecks need us to be, we must do three things:\n\nNetwork\n\nWe need to connect with other black women\u2014inside and outside our industries. We must reach ahead and behind with the recognition that it feels as good to give as it does to receive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, ask your colleagues which professional groups they belong to. Ask your friends if they have friends in your industry they can connect you to. Join online industry groups. I belong to about a dozen professional groups on Facebook, which have resulted in new contracts and increased confidence. My favorite group is a community of seven black women writers whom I connect with almost daily. We discuss our challenges, encourage one another and talk money. Each one is my Wanda Sykes.\n\nAsk\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask your sistah-friends what they make. Now, I know that can be a bit awkward, but you can simply say something like, \u201cI have a personal question for you: Do you mind sharing with me how much you made on project X?\u201d Or you can pose a more general question: \u201cDo you mind telling me the pay range for someone in your position? I want to ensure that I\u2019m not short-changing myself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTell\n\nIf a sistah-friend asks about your paycheck, tell her! The longer we\u2019re all hush-hush about our pay, the longer we can all be lowballed. We must abandon the toxic, individualistic cultural mores that say that talking about money is taboo. We must relinquish long-held cultural norms that discourage us from \u201ctellin\u2019 our business\u201d\u2014because they no longer serve us. If we take a collective approach to owning our worth and demanding that worth, we will all rise, together.", "keywords": ["sistahfriend", "pay", "davis", "lowballed", "paid", "money", "worth", "need", "sykes", "women", "wanda", "know", "black"], "polarity": 0.06734326018808777, "subjectivity": 0.36487456987457},

The Oscar-winning actress and comedian asked everyone to support her in her fight for wages equal to what the likes of Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock and Amy Schumer were offered.\n\nAfter Mo\u2019Nique told her side of things, reports circulated that she had actually been offered $3 million as part of a deal in which she would be required to do a live audition for Netflix executives. That story is said to have originated with internet personality Jawn Murray.\n\nMo\u2019Nique addressed Murray directly in an Instagram post Wednesday, posting a copy of the actual contract Netflix sent, which not only mentions the offer of $500,000 but also includes some questionable terms that would have left Mo\u2019Nique struggling for two years after the special if she had accepted them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the terms presented in the contract Netflix offered Mo\u2019Nique, it would own the copyright of the program and control all exhibition rights. It would own all audio rights. And basically? It would own Mo\u2019Nique.\n\nFor 12 months after the special premiered, Mo\u2019Nique would not be allowed to tape or negotiate another comedy special with anyone else. When that 12 months was up, Netflix would have dibs on her next comedy special, and she would be able to do one with someone else (HBO, for example) only if Netflix passed first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor 24 months after the special premiered, Mo\u2019Nique would not be able to crack any of the jokes she did in the Netflix special anywhere else, and when the 24 months were up\u2014Netflix would have first dibs on those jokes, too.\n\nSo basically, Netflix wanted her to take $500,000 to not be able to do what she is in the business of doing in the first place, and she was supposed to be OK with that?\n\nHell no.\n\nAfter seeing the details of the contract, I completely understand why Mo\u2019Nique was on her \u201cfuck Netflix.\u201d I would be, too, if I were she.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you think now?

According to the cacophony of social media voices, Netflix\u2019s offer was a business decision, not an affront to her \u201cr\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d as the star claimed.\n\nBut was it, though?\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Netflix did not make $20 million from Chappelle\u2019s and Rock\u2019s specials. The service would have to see more than 150,000 new customers who subscribed for at least a year, only to watch the stand-up specials, to recoup $20 million. The publicity and free advertising from the hype surrounding the specials may partially justify the financial commitment to Rock, Chappelle and, in addition, Schumer, but not totally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of Netflix\u2019s corporate strategy is to bill itself as the go-to source for stand-up comedy. It would be hard for the company to sell that idea to customers if its platform didn\u2019t have content from Rock and Chappelle, who are unequivocally considered two of the biggest-name comedians in the world. But Mo\u2019Nique does have a point about Schumer.\n\nMo\u2019Nique\u2019s main point of contention seems to be fellow comedian Schumer\u2019s infamous negotiation with Netflix for her 2016 showcase, The Leather Special, when the young comic famously negotiated an $11 million payday after she found out how much Chappelle and Rock had received.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchumer is the perfect example of those whom we consider \u201cstars\u201d who are mostly creations of media hype and publicity. When Inside Amy Schumer hit the Comedy Central lineup, Schumer immediately became a star. Movie executives thrust millions of dollars at her. The marginally funny comic quickly became the next big thing. Apparently, fans everywhere loved some Amy Schumer.\n\nBut not really.\n\nFewer than 1 million people watch each episode of Inside Amy Schumer. More people watch Love & Hip Hop. The recently canceled Underground drew more viewers than Schumer\u2019s show on a network that was much less visible, especially in the coveted 18-49 demographic. Some people might point out that Inside Amy Schumer won two Emmys. The counterargument to that point is that Mo\u2019Nique owns an award some people like to refer to as a \u201cmotherfucking Oscar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever you think of Schumer\u2019s comedy and whether or not she is as funny as Mo\u2019Nique (she is not), it is hard to ignore the fact that Schumer\u2019s perceived success is because she is a young white woman, making her more sellable to mainstream audiences. Schumer is a bankable celebrity because the show business establishment says she is a show business establishment ... the same establishment that usually rushes to build a pedestal for white owners of golden statues.\n\nThis is how Hollywood works. The Kardashians make hundreds of millions of dollars because they are entertainment moguls with a hugely popular reality show. The black women on \u201cghetto reality TV\u201d should take note except for one fact: More people watch Love & Hip Hop than Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nStraight Out of Compton wasn\u2019t nominated for an Academy Award because it was a black film and too musical, until Straight Outta Wypipo Compton La La Land was nominated for Best Picture the following year.

No one doubts the veracity of the claims by people like Lee Daniels that the Precious star can be combative, but remember that Netflix turned a blind eye to fellow Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey\u2019s belligerence and shelled out millions to support his alleged boy-raping and \u201cnigger\u201d-spewing habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to unpredictability, Netflix is apparently willing to ignore the unpredictable past actions of comedians like Katt Williams and Dave Chappelle. It might be because of their comedic brilliance. After all, the company was willing to ignore the claims of sexual misconduct against Louis C.K., which were an open secret for years, until the accusations became widely known.\n\nOf course, Netflix has the right to offer whatever amount of money to whomever it wishes, but the people who say the offer to Mo\u2019Nique was based on celebrity popularity or some calculated algorithm are either uninformed or intentionally disingenuous.\n\nSo if Mo\u2019Nique wasn\u2019t lowballed because of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, financial considerations or her reputation, why was she offered much less than her contemporaries?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix\u2019s offer to Mo\u2019nique may simply reflect the fact that she might not be as big a star as she thinks she is.

She posted a video on her Instagram account Friday explaining why she was upset.\n\nAs she looked directly into the camera, Mo\u2019Nique said the following:\n\nHey, my loves, I am asking that you stand with me and boycott Netflix for gender bias and color bias. I was offered a $500,000 deal last week to do a comedy special. However, Amy Schumer was offered $11 million; Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle, $20 million.

However, I should get more,\u201d and Netflix agreed. When we asked Netflix to explain the difference, why the money was so different, they said, \u201cWell, we believe that\u2019s what Mo\u2019Nique will bring.\u201d We said, \u2018What about my r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u2019 They said, \u201cWe don\u2019t go off of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201d Then we asked them, \u201cWhat was it about Amy Schumer?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, she sold out Madison Square Garden twice and she had a big movie over the summer. Is that not Amy Schumer\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d And then Netflix said, \u201cBy the way, we believe Mo\u2019Nique is a legend, too.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I get what the legends are getting?

After all, the company was willing to ignore the claims of sexual misconduct against Louis C.K., which were an open secret for years, until the accusations became widely known.\n\nOf course, Netflix has the right to offer whatever amount of money to whomever it wishes, but the people who say the offer to Mo\u2019Nique was based on celebrity popularity or some calculated algorithm are either uninformed or intentionally disingenuous.\n\nSo if Mo\u2019Nique wasn\u2019t lowballed because of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, financial considerations or her reputation, why was she offered much less than her contemporaries?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix\u2019s offer to Mo\u2019nique may simply reflect the fact that she might not be as big a star as she thinks she is. She might have been lowballed because she is a notorious hardhead. But even if she is overvaluing her worth, there is little doubt that Netflix would not offer the same amount to a white man with Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s show business r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Or a white woman. Or a man.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think Mo\u2019Nique deserves the same amount as some of the biggest names in comedy ...\n\nEven if you think she is an unapologetic blowhard who needs to learn how not to throw shade like flash grenades ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if the prospect of black people boycotting Netflix is as likely as Colin Kaepernick emerging from beneath the stage during the Super Bowl halftime show to rip off Janet Jackson\u2019s top, revealing a red H&M \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt, while they all kneel as Justin Timberlake\u2019s falsetto voice hums \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d you must admit:\n\nMo\u2019Nique was right.", "keywords": ["white", "angry", "fear", "netflix", "monique", "woman", "offer", "chappelle", "million", "amy", "right", "rock", "schumer", "comedy", "black"], "polarity": 0.12310167765775246, "subjectivity": 0.45939569257326257},

Microaggressions become too much? Poverty a pain in the ass? Racism got you fucked up?\n\n\n\nWell, black women, there\u2019s now a place to place all of your justifiable but sometimes \u201cproblematic\u201d anger, an actual depository to just vent, let loose and scream (or text) your ass off like Nola Darling did in a recent episode of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It reboot on Netflix.\n\nWe know that as African Americans and women, black women face the double dig of both gender and racial oppression. But because of racialized labels like the \u201cangry black women\u201d as well as socialization to just grin and bear it, black women often swallow or internalize their anger, where it festers and seeps out in destructive ways. Or, too often, when we express anger, we\u2019re dismissed as being emotional.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one University of California, Berkeley, doctoral student, Malika Imhotep, 24, has created a space, the Bank of Hysteria, to deposit (ahem) the wrath that so many of us feel.\n\n\n\nImhotep explains her idea in a callout for participants:\n\nToo often, those angry voices are dismissed as irrational, but we think that anger is valid and should be heard. 510-985-9986 is the number to the Bank of Hysteria Toll-Free Rage Hotline. Call and/or text to invest in your anger. Leave an honest message, say the things you\u2019ve been holding in for fear of being labeled as \u201cangry\u201d or \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d What angers you? What enrages you? What people, places or things have tried your patience or attempted to silence you? Let us help you invest in your rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImhotep says that the Bank of Hysteria grew out of a course she\u2019s taking on ways of using new media tools to produce socially engaged art projects. Imhotep says she was placed in a group focused on gender.\n\n\u201cAnd we started to think about what are the ways we could intervene in popular discourse,\u201d Imhotep told The Root. \u201cWhat is it about women of color, femmes, nonbinary folks that doesn\u2019t get affirmed? Their anger. What does it mean to always be called angry or too emotional or to be written off and not allowed to access that?\u201d\n\nImhotep says that in light of the social unrest and drama on Berkeley\u2019s campus over the past year, her group deemed it necessary to \u201ccreate ways to validate and give platform to anger\u201d\u2014especially from women. Particularly from black women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs black women especially these days, you\u2019re so worried, you\u2019re so preoccupied with the way people read anger and intimidation before you even say anything, and then when something actually unnerves you, you have to negotiate all these different things like, well, they already think I\u2019m about to pop off, so how do I go about expressing myself?\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nImhotep says that Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cThe Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism\u201d speech, given at a feminist conference in 1981 (and also found in the seminal black feminist text Sister Outsider), informed a lot of the project. Lorde gave voice to the fact that often her response to racism is anger, but so often she was not able to express it, which can be destructive to the spirit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actual name of the project came from women being dismissed as hysterical, and the creators\u2019 desire for women to invest in that anger, which led to the banking metaphor. It also riffed on \u201cBank of America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re doing and constructing, kind of like, is a simulated bank-teller booth, and we\u2019ll be printing out rage receipts,\u201d says Imhotep. \u201cWe\u2019ll then be taking all the responses, and so the installation will be a rolling scroll ... of rage receipts of the responses, mixed with some creative use of the receipts on a wall.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project creators\u2014Imhotep, Jess Liu, Becca Milman and Phyllis Thai\u2014also made pins and Bank of Hysteria credit cards, and say the first iteration should go up Dec. 6. But that is only the first phase. Imhotep says that the project will live on (so keep calling and texting) and may appear again at a later date.\n\nInitially, Imhotep says, because the campus is where they initially advertised the project, the first commentary was around transgressions in classroom spaces, with comments such as, \u201cPeople say I don\u2019t look like I major in computer science, but I do and it makes me angry.\u201d But after seeing commentary such as, \u201cI\u2019m still angry about slavery,\u201d she knew she wanted to reach out to black women specifically, who have a complicated relationship with anger.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat I understand personally and from an academic standpoint is that there are ways that we\u2019re forced to view and interact with ourselves as black people and as black women, which creates a fragmentation,\u201d Imhotep explains. \u201cAnd that fragmentation has been talked about by people who have experienced mania, seasonal affective disorder or just \u2018I don\u2019t feel good.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nShe continues, \u201cI think folks bottle it up, and it manifests in serious health issues; or you see people who cannot bottle it up, and that\u2019s when they get labeled as erratic and problematic. Or, somehow, less than respectable.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a phrase, Imhotep says, \u201clet it out\u201d\u2014like Solange in her song \u201cMad\u201d\u2014because holding on to anger can be destructive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt some level, part of what this project [is] is giving folks the space to vent ... helping black folks put a pressure valve on all these things that get contained,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least symbolically.\u201d\n\nTo participate, call or text 510-985-9986 for the Bank of Hysteria Toll-Free Rage Hotline.", "keywords": ["angry", "handscall", "black", "imhotep", "bank", "project", "women", "anger", "hysteria", "ways", "vent", "dont", "think", "throw"], "polarity": -0.15384771677875123, "subjectivity": 0.4692547714099437},

For this season, Vanzant, known for her work with Basketball Wives\u2019 reality star Evelyn Lozada after her violent breakup with former NFL player Chad \u201cOchocinco\u201d Johnson, and also known for helping Chris Brown\u2019s ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran, launched a four-part special titled, \u201cHouse of Healing: The Myth of the Angry Black Woman.\u201d\n\nEight women\u2014including actress Chrystale Wilson, known to some viewers as the stripper Ronnie from Ice Cube\u2019s 1998 film, The Player\u2019s Club, and Lira Galore, the former fiancee of rap mogul Rick Ross\u2014share a house as Vanzant coaches them into their better selves.\n\nThe Root caught up with Vanzant, who has been helping black women heal themselves since the mid-1990s with such best-selling signature books as Acts of Faith and Faith in the Valley, to chat about why she chose this direction and topic and what steps viewers can take to fix their own lives.\n\nThe Root: What prompted the \u201cHouse of Healing\u201d direction, tackling the myth of the \u201cangry black woman\u201d for Fix My Life?\n\nIyanla Vanzant: My intention was to look at a common issue from a variety of perspectives because the women in the house represent a broad spectrum. You got a 20-something to a 40-something. You got single women; you got a married woman. You got mothers. You got women who\u2019ve never been mothers. I wanted to look at a single issue from a variety of perspectives because I think that gives the viewers a deeper connection. From the very beginning, I\u2019ve always said that Fix My Life is not television; it\u2019s participatory work. So to be able to do that is what is giving this particular show the flavor that it has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Why did you choose this topic?\n\nIV: The reason I chose the topic was because I got my feelings hurt one day when I was online and someone wrote that Mrs. Obama was an angry black woman. And they put a picture of her up, and I\u2019m sure she was moving or talking, and you can snap a picture in an instant, and it looked like her face was distorted and her hands were in the air. I didn\u2019t at all see it as angry, but it just brought to my mind that anger has become an identity that has been cast upon us, and we\u2019ve taken it on.\n\nAnd anger is not who you are. Anger may be what you feel. Anger may be what you experience, but it is not who you are, and so many of us walk around saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an angry black woman,\u201d not understanding that we are perpetuating a stereotype that dehumanizes us. Because anger is an emotion, and all humans have emotion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy don\u2019t they ever call us disappointed black women? Why don\u2019t they ever call us neglected black women? Why don\u2019t they ever call us hurt black women or diminished black women? Why do we have to be angry? Look at all of the things that we experience. Look at all of the emotions that we feel. But the one that\u2019s put on us is the one that dehumanizes us.\n\nTR: So what is one of the key ways to combat that?\n\nIV: It\u2019s to look to what\u2019s underneath the anger and that\u2019s what we do in the \u201cHouse of Healing.\u201d We\u2019re looking at what\u2019s underneath the anger because the women, themselves, were not aware. The average human beings on the planet have a very limited emotional vocabulary. We know good, bad, right and wrong, sad, happy. We don\u2019t know diminish, demean, disappointed. We don\u2019t know dismissed. We know frustration, but we don\u2019t know that as an emotional experience, so because of our limited emotional vocabulary, I thought it would be very enlightening to look underneath the anger, because this is really what motivates the behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: So how can this translate to regular viewers? These women have the benefit of living in a house where you\u2019re there to guide and coach them. How do people at home begin that process and make their home a \u201cHouse of Healing\u201d?\n\nIV: Every single week, I have given a worksheet. For every single one of these shows, there is a downloadable worksheet that supports you in getting in touch with what you feel. Now, the thing is, we don\u2019t want to do the work. We want to sit and be voyeurs. We want to criticize. We want to judge. But you have to do the work.\n\nThose women worked their butts off. They did their journaling. They answered the questions that were presented to them. They honored the memories that were frightening and uncomfortable. But the average viewer at home wants to watch everybody else and not do their work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do we do it? I\u2019ve made the worksheets available. How do we do it? Begin to tell yourself the truth. How do we do it? You have to engage in spiritual practice, where you learn how to breathe and how to be still and how not to react to every little thing. It\u2019s about doing the work.

Is it the color of red blood spilling onto concrete? Is it green like the dirty money folded into the back pockets of politicians who would rather incarcerate black youth than educate them?\n\n\n\nDuring The Root\u2019s Black History Month series on poverty and the drug war\u2014in partnership with the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014we continued to excavate the truth from the ruins of targeted and occupied communities that have been ravaged by the so-called war on drugs. We delved into the numbers and reiterated that poverty, police and prisons are forms of structural violence that have been thrust upon black, brown and indigenous communities in the service of white supremacist patriarchal capitalism\u2014that the shame is not ours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no conspiracy that this nation, which holds itself in such high esteem, despite being the prison warden of the world, has conspired against the very communities that were forced to build it on their backs.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance reports:\n\nPeople of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system and are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record. This is particularly the case for drug-law violations.\n\nNearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.\n\nResearch shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory-minimum sentence for black people than for white people charged with the same offense. Among people who received a mandatory-minimum sentence in 2011, 38 percent were Latino and 31 percent were black.\n\nBlack people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups. They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs. Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police-community interactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the color of pain is black, and it is neither fatalistic nor nihilistic to come to that conclusion. It is neither a diminishing nor rejection of black joy, black resilience or black futures to make that plain. From draconian drug policies to disenfranchisement, money-bail bond systems to civil-asset forfeiture, food and housing instability to police officers killing black people with impunity\u2014and preying on vulnerable black women simply because they can\u2014this system was designed to enslave black people and ration out freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, what does justice look like within a white supremacist police state that lies to itself about the depth of its own character? What freedom dreams can we conjure within a system created to criminalize, dehumanize and destroy us?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKassandra Frederique, New York state director at the Drug Policy Alliance, the visionary behind DPA\u2019s Black History Month series, and 2016 The Root 100 honoree, has consistently and unapologetically maintained that the history of the drug war in this country is inextricably linked to black history. She\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without acknowledging that the Nixon administration camouflaged its war on black people by causing hysteria around drugs, nor without acknowledging the Jim Crow era drug policies that continue to define Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without discussing mass incarceration, the disappearing of black men into the jaws of the criminal (in)justice system, the vilification of black mothers suffering through addiction, and the state-sponsored police slaying of black children.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore that the drug war has influenced everything from inhumane immigration policies to racist housing policies. We can\u2019t ignore that generational poverty has been equated to moral bankruptcy in this country; nor can we ignore that harm reduction for some working-class or poor black people is less about battling addiction, and more about navigating institutionalized, systemic anti-blackness. Grief, trauma, addiction, stigma, punishment: This is the cycle that must be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some black people, it is an act of self-perseverance to point to black people doing well by most metrics and say, \u201cLook, all of us aren\u2019t selling weed or living in the hood or in jail.\u201d And it is this line of classist, condescending thinking that led many black people to support tough-on-crime/tough-on-drugs legislation under both President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton without looking at the oppressive conditions that often lead to both. In this country, more than any other, violent drug policy has been carved out of black flesh.\n\nThe color of pain is black, but so is the color of freedom.\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique said. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledge.\n\nAtone.\n\nAct.\n\nThat is what Color of Pain\u2014a Drug Policy Alliance initiative spearheaded by Frederique and Dionna King, policy manager at the New York office of the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014is demanding: Reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Drug Policy Alliance\n\nThe Color of Pain website is an invaluable resource for us all. The necessity of Racial and Ethnic Impact Statements, which \u201c[require] policymakers proposing new legislation or changes to existing legislation to assess the potential impact on racial disparities,\u201d is outlined. The drug war\u2019s destructive path is mapped through all the systems that black people are forced to navigate without the recognition of their humanity: education, social services, mental health, criminal justice system and the child-welfare system.\n\n\n\nAs Black History Month comes to a close, let us remember that black dignity is important all year round; black health is important all year round; black joy is important all year round; black lives matter all year round.

His attorneys filed a motion for bail on Nov. 16, but Judge Genece Brinkley has yet to issue a ruling on that motion.\n\nOn Monday, Meek\u2019s attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition, claiming that Brinkley was ignoring Meek\u2019s post-sentencing motions and making it impossible for him to file an appeal, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania Superior Court denied the rapper\u2019s request to be freed from prison and allowed to post bail, it ruled that Brinkley should immediately rule on Meek\u2019s previous request, saying, \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas is directed to enter a disposition of petitioner\u2019s Nov. 16, 2017, motion for bail without further delay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrinkley sentenced Meek Mill to prison earlier this month after a drug test came back positive for the prescription drug Percocet and the rapper was arrested twice this year\u2014once for an altercation in a St. Louis airport and again for popping wheelies on a motorcycle in New York.\n\nThe criminal charges in both of those arrests were later dropped, but the judge determined that the mere fact he was arrested violated the terms of his probation. She sentenced him to prison even though both a prosecutor and Meek\u2019s probation officer recommended that he not be jailed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Meek\u2019s attorney Joe Tacopina said: \u201cWe are pleased that the Superior Court took immediate action to direct the Court of Common Pleas to decide on the application for bail \u2018without further delay.\u2019 We remain hopeful that Mr. Williams will be promptly released on bail.\u201d\n\nOn Monday the Rev.

Now-former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager was accused of shooting unarmed African-American motorist Walter Scott in the back five times as Scott fled after a traffic stop in a confrontation caught on video.\n\nThe police killings of black men across the nation, including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.; Freddie Gray, who died in police custody in Baltimore; and more recent incidents, such as the police shootings of Philando Castile in Minnesota, Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla., sparked protests around the country and further fractured an already tense relationship between law enforcement and communities of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there were also deadly attacks on police officers. An African-American sniper killed five police officers in Dallas, saying that he wanted to kill whites, particularly white police officers. Another black man killed three police officers in Baton Rouge over the summer. President Barack Obama condemned both attacks, but some law enforcement leaders were angered by what they saw as not enough support to police officers in the president\u2019s comments about the police shootings of black men.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump offered strong support to police officers during the campaign, posting on Facebook back in February that law enforcement officers are not respected in this country. But Trump also referenced the racial divide in the nation in a Facebook posting after the killing of the police officers in Dallas. He secured the endorsements of several law enforcement agencies, including the National Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nBut what all this will mean for policing and police brutality under a President Trump isn\u2019t quite clear. In late October, Trump released a 100-day plan (pdf) that included a Restoring Community Safety Act. Its aim is to reduce crime, drugs and violence by creating a task force on violent crime, increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police, and increasing resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. The plan isn\u2019t on his current presidential transition team\u2019s website, though. Still, many police organizations are looking forward to the Trump administration and are pleased by his nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) for U.S. attorney general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe obviously feel he said all the right things about how he appreciates and supports law enforcement,\u201d National Sheriff\u2019s Association President Greg Champagne tells The Root. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for special treatment; we\u2019re just asking to be treated fairly, and when incidents occur, no rush to judgment. Don\u2019t condemn a police officer because it\u2019s the popular thing to do when a crowd is in turmoil. The criminal-justice system is not an instantaneous process.\u201d\n\nHe says that his organization was among several law enforcement groups that met with Trump\u2019s transition team last week. Among other things, Champagne says, police want to see mental-health reform so that the mentally ill don\u2019t become the responsibility of law enforcement and end up in jails for minor disturbances. His organization also wants to see immigration reform because the number of undocumented immigrants is stressing law enforcement across the country, and the group supports federal-sentencing reform that, he says, doesn\u2019t abandon the safety of the American public.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a good goal to have less people incarcerated, but it needs to be looked at,\u201d Champagne says, \u201cand we need a holistic approach: mental health, poverty in cities, opioids, immigration; all of those things contribute to crime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChampagne says that his agency is among those supporting the reinstatement of the 1033 Program, the federal initiative that allowed the transfer of surplus military equipment from the Department of Defense to local police departments. Images of heavily armed police in military vehicles during the protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown was killed caused consternation among those who felt the response was unnecessarily harsh. But Champagne says the equipment is meant to be used defensively, not offensively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for grenades or cannons. We\u2019re looking for armored vehicles,\u201d Champagne explains, adding that armored equipment is how law enforcement officers are able to get to scenes and take out terrorists like the ones in the San Bernardino, Calif., attack. \u201cWe \u2026 will urge Trump by executive order to undo what Obama did restricting that equipment.\u201d\n\nBut civil rights leaders and activists of color are concerned that under a Trump administration, the Justice Department could move away from the aggressive stance it has taken against police misconduct and discrimination as well as for civil rights under President Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the Los Angeles Times that Sessions \u201cmust be committed to equal justice under the law for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when our country is gripped by a spike in hate crimes, we need an attorney general who will not fan the flames of hate,\u201d Clarke says.\n\nIn October the Justice Department allocated about $119 million to fund a hiring program that allows law enforcement agencies to increase their community-policing capacity and crime-prevention efforts. In May of last year, the Obama administration released the final report (pdf) of the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, aimed at helping to build trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. There are no signs, so far, that anything about those efforts will change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, activists such as the Rev. Ben McBride, deputy director of PICO California, worry that there is still what they call \u201cimplicit bias\u201d against African Americans by some law enforcement officers, even in incidents where no one is killed. McBride spoke with The Root about a traffic stop last month in Richmond, Calif. In a video posted on Facebook, McBride is seen berating three white police officers who stopped a black woman for having expired tags and ordered her car towed instead of giving her a ticket.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no criminal record here; you could\u2019ve used discretion, but you chose not to \u2026 and that, sir, is the reason that black people do not have trust for white police officers in their community where you do not live,\u201d McBride yells at the officers.\n\nHe says that he has heard from black police officers in Oakland, Calif., that some of their white counterparts have been quoting the president-elect\u2019s slogan that he\u2019ll make America great again, and that worries him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a great concern. I have more concern about supporters of Trump in law enforcement and in the community than I do over Trump himself. We have to deal with these people, and they have power to take away life and freedom under the law,\u201d McBride says. \u201cWe recognize that every American has the right to vote for whomever they chose, but we have the responsibility to be aware of those choices and how they impact our lives and personal safety.\u201d\n\nAllison Keyes is an award-winning correspondent, host and author.

Is it the color of red blood spilling onto concrete? Is it green like the dirty money folded into the back pockets of politicians who would rather incarcerate black youth than educate them?\n\n\n\nDuring The Root\u2019s Black History Month series on poverty and the drug war\u2014in partnership with the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014we continued to excavate the truth from the ruins of targeted and occupied communities that have been ravaged by the so-called war on drugs. We delved into the numbers and reiterated that poverty, police and prisons are forms of structural violence that have been thrust upon black, brown and indigenous communities in the service of white supremacist patriarchal capitalism\u2014that the shame is not ours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no conspiracy that this nation, which holds itself in such high esteem, despite being the prison warden of the world, has conspired against the very communities that were forced to build it on their backs.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance reports:\n\nPeople of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system and are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record. This is particularly the case for drug-law violations.\n\nNearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.\n\nResearch shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory-minimum sentence for black people than for white people charged with the same offense. Among people who received a mandatory-minimum sentence in 2011, 38 percent were Latino and 31 percent were black.\n\nBlack people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups. They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs. Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police-community interactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the color of pain is black, and it is neither fatalistic nor nihilistic to come to that conclusion. It is neither a diminishing nor rejection of black joy, black resilience or black futures to make that plain. From draconian drug policies to disenfranchisement, money-bail bond systems to civil-asset forfeiture, food and housing instability to police officers killing black people with impunity\u2014and preying on vulnerable black women simply because they can\u2014this system was designed to enslave black people and ration out freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, what does justice look like within a white supremacist police state that lies to itself about the depth of its own character? What freedom dreams can we conjure within a system created to criminalize, dehumanize and destroy us?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKassandra Frederique, New York state director at the Drug Policy Alliance, the visionary behind DPA\u2019s Black History Month series, and 2016 The Root 100 honoree, has consistently and unapologetically maintained that the history of the drug war in this country is inextricably linked to black history. She\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without acknowledging that the Nixon administration camouflaged its war on black people by causing hysteria around drugs, nor without acknowledging the Jim Crow era drug policies that continue to define Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without discussing mass incarceration, the disappearing of black men into the jaws of the criminal (in)justice system, the vilification of black mothers suffering through addiction, and the state-sponsored police slaying of black children.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore that the drug war has influenced everything from inhumane immigration policies to racist housing policies. We can\u2019t ignore that generational poverty has been equated to moral bankruptcy in this country; nor can we ignore that harm reduction for some working-class or poor black people is less about battling addiction, and more about navigating institutionalized, systemic anti-blackness. Grief, trauma, addiction, stigma, punishment: This is the cycle that must be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some black people, it is an act of self-perseverance to point to black people doing well by most metrics and say, \u201cLook, all of us aren\u2019t selling weed or living in the hood or in jail.\u201d And it is this line of classist, condescending thinking that led many black people to support tough-on-crime/tough-on-drugs legislation under both President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton without looking at the oppressive conditions that often lead to both. In this country, more than any other, violent drug policy has been carved out of black flesh.\n\nThe color of pain is black, but so is the color of freedom.\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique said. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledge.\n\nAtone.\n\nAct.\n\nThat is what Color of Pain\u2014a Drug Policy Alliance initiative spearheaded by Frederique and Dionna King, policy manager at the New York office of the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014is demanding: Reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Drug Policy Alliance\n\nThe Color of Pain website is an invaluable resource for us all. The necessity of Racial and Ethnic Impact Statements, which \u201c[require] policymakers proposing new legislation or changes to existing legislation to assess the potential impact on racial disparities,\u201d is outlined. The drug war\u2019s destructive path is mapped through all the systems that black people are forced to navigate without the recognition of their humanity: education, social services, mental health, criminal justice system and the child-welfare system.\n\n\n\nAs Black History Month comes to a close, let us remember that black dignity is important all year round; black health is important all year round; black joy is important all year round; black lives matter all year round.

This Black History Month, The Root, in partnership with Drug Policy Alliance, takes a deep look at why the war on drugs cannot be divorced from generational poverty, the carceral state and white supremacy.\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to grow, so, too, does the realization that black and brown, poor and working-class communities most harmed by the so-called war on drugs do not have access to this new gold rush.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe profiteers of this war\u2014this storefront operation created for the sole purpose of laundering the institutional, systemic, coordinated assaults on black and brown communities\u2014are primarily white men with access to capital who navigate society unencumbered by the intentional violence of the carceral state. This, subsequently, gives them the freedom to be legal drug dealers, while jails across the nation continue to be filled with black and brown people incarcerated for low-level drug crimes\u2014if police officers don\u2019t get to them first.\n\nThat might be how this white supremacist capitalist system was intended to function, but the Hood Incubator has something else in mind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormed in 2017 in Oakland, Calif., the Hood Incubator, founded by Ebele Ifedigbo, 29, and Lanese Martin, 32, was created in response to the state\u2019s marijuana legalization in order to create pathways to ownership in the cannabis industry for black and brown people most harmed by the drug war.\n\nThe community-centered organization is committed to \u201cbuilding economic and political power for black and brown communities,\u201d and is well on the way to radically transforming an industry guarded by white gatekeepers.\n\n\u201cWhile marijuana use is roughly equal among black[s] and whites nationwide, black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession,\u201d the Hood Incubator states on its website. \u201cNow that cannabis is a thriving $8 billion legal industry [pdf], black people make up less than 5 percent [pdf] of founders and business owners.\n\nIn the interview that follows, Ifedigbo talks to the The Root about the difficulties they\u2019ve faced in shattering racialized stigmas attached to cannabis, breaking through institutionalized barriers, abolition, and why it\u2019s necessary for black and brown people to be at the forefront of the cannabis industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: When I think of the word \u201cincubator,\u201d the concept of incubation in the context of the hood, I think of distilling, healing, growing, becoming, protecting. Explain to me why it is important to you that black people, who have been most severely harmed by the drug war, have access to the growing cannabis industry?\n\n\n\nEbele Ifedigbo: It\u2019s important that black people have access to the growing cannabis industry precisely because we have been the most harmed by cannabis prohibition. There\u2019s the adage of \u201cmore risk, more reward\u201d when it comes to economics and investments. That same principle should hold true when it comes to the marijuana industry: Black communities have objectively taken on the vast majority of the risk and negative consequences associated with marijuana being illegal. We are four times more likely to be arrested for weed-related offenses than white people, despite the fact that marijuana use is equal across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have taken on those consequences and it has had heartbreaking systematic outcomes for our families and communities. So, now, as the industry is legalizing and growing like wildfire, projected to be $20 billion by 2020, black communities should be at the forefront of accessing the rewards and resources that come along with that legalization and growth.\n\nTR: In a nation that renders economically exploited black and brown people disposable, what are some of the institutional barriers you\u2019ve faced in trying to arm our communities with the knowledge and licensure it requires to sell cannabis legally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEI: In the process of developing the model for the Hood Incubator, we did extensive research and perspective gathering to make sure our work effectively addresses the barriers that our people are truly facing. Between Lanese using her background in community organizing and political organizing to do on-the-ground community organizing\u2014hosting early member meetings, attending council meetings with impacted residents, connecting people in different parts of the informal industry\u2014and my census and economic-data-based research, we were able to really hone in on the institutional barriers our folks are up against.\n\nWe found that, almost across the board, black and brown communities face barriers in accessing the 1) networks, 2) technical support and assistance, and 3) financial capital it takes to thrive in the legal industry.\n\nThe legal marijuana space is still very new, so \u201cwho you know\u201d is still a primary success factor. Are you connected to lawmakers? Are you connected to influential investors? Are you backed by community members? It is very difficult to thrive and compete in the marketplace if you are operating in isolation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the state of the market, it is imperative that business owners surround themselves with a community of advisers, subject-matter experts and supporters who can help the business successfully navigate and make decisions in a rapidly growing and fast-paced, but also highly regulated, volatile and risky industry.\n\nOftentimes, black and brown people are cut off from these networks and knowledge bases, or it takes us longer to build the relationships, and that dampens our [collective] ability to keep up in the marijuana industry.\n\nAt the same time, the networks and knowledge bases that we have been able to resiliently amass over time in the informal marijuana industry are often judged negatively when assessed within the traditional frameworks of \u201centrepreneurial success,\u201d and that is used to justify our exclusion from industry opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccess to financial capital is key, too. The marijuana business is capital intensive. The fact that the industry still operates in a gray area only adds to the cost of doing business and makes it more difficult to attract investment across the board. Entrepreneurs need financial capital to endure the ups and downs of the market and grow their businesses over time. But nationwide, less than 1 percent of venture capital funding goes to black founders. From our experiences, black founders in the marijuana industry are facing similar financial barriers.\n\n\n\nThat said, right now we have a wide-open opportunity to address these institutional barriers and shift the narrative. The key question is: How do we create a marijuana industry that fundamentally centers the interests of communities that have taken on the risks that have allowed for the legal industry to even exist in the first place? That is the work that the Hood Incubator takes on. We are working to make that vision real by centering black and brown communities in all the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: One of the things that I\u2019ve witnessed is a kind of internalized hatred and fear and stigma that attaches cannabis to poverty and black criminality. There are some in our communities who believe \u201cjust saying no\u201d is what \u201crespectable\u201d black folks do. Have you witnessed this in your work\u2014and, if so, how have you worked to dismantle those perceptions?\n\n\n\nEI: Yes, we have come across these perspectives in our work. We welcome people with all different perspectives because we recognize that everyone is coming to this marijuana conversation with different experiences and assessments of what marijuana represents and what the promise of the industry is (or is not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that, at the end of the day, if you are black, you have experienced negative impacts from the drug war, either directly or indirectly. And that gives your voice, your questions and your concerns an inherent weight and legitimacy that cannot be denied.\n\nWe create a culture at the Hood Incubator where any of our community members can come to learn and discuss the plant and the industry amongst peers. As a community, when we share our stories and perspectives amongst ourselves, we are all able to both teach and learn in equal measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen engaging folks who are wary of cannabis and what it represents, we center the core promise of the industry. For the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power, especially given the fact that we have paid and continue to pay the costs that it has taken to get to this moment in the legalization movement.\n\nWe believe it would be a huge mistake to shy away from doing the necessary groundwork to ensure that we actually access the tangible economic and sociopolitical benefits that the industry can offer our communities.\n\nWhether an individual chooses personally to consume the plant or not, it is hard to deny the opportunity we have to build something greater from this industry\u2014a legacy of intergenerational wealth and economic sustainability for black families and communities nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power.\n\nTR: This is not just about policy; it is about restorative and transformative justice\u2014and what you are doing is revolutionary. So many black people are still incarcerated, communities decimated, while white people reap the benefits of a narrative shift that has taken place on the backs of black folks. How important is abolition in your work?\n\nEI: As an organization we\u2019re deeply rooted in an understanding of the atrocities of mass incarceration and over-criminalization of black people. When it comes to marijuana, black people are four times more likely to be arrested for a cannabis-related offense then white people, despite equal rates of use across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary. We believe that people are inherently motivated to make positive contributions in society as long as they have all of the resources and support they need. If we can create the set of conditions where everyone has what they need, then we will have no need for a prison system. In our work, we center the principles of access, healing, opportunity and restorative justice.\n\nTR: Where do you see the Hood Incubator and the cannabis industry in five years?\n\nEI: In five years, we see the Hood Incubator operating nationally. Our growth strategy is to go deep in Oakland, in the Bay Area, and in California so we can learn what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and create models of best practice that can be replicated and implemented in cities and states around the country over the next five years. We want to play a key role in shaping what equity means in the marijuana industry, and we plan to support the various stakeholders\u2014community organizations, lawmakers, industry operators\u2014to be effective in the implementation of cannabis-equity initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want initiatives and frameworks that just sound good, we want frameworks that can fundamentally transform power dynamics and effectively turn the marijuana plant from a weapon that has been used to decimate black and under-resourced communities, into a tool that can help to repair the harms we have experienced from the drug war and mass incarceration.\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d Instead, we will be proud of the work that we\u2019ve done collectively to shape the industry in a positive way that ensures justice and real economic opportunity for black and brown communities.\n\nClick here to support the Hood Incubator by becoming a monthly sustainer.\n\n", "keywords": ["cannabis", "communities", "hood", "work", "organization", "drug", "ownership", "calif", "brown", "oakland", "industry", "marijuana", "incubator", "empowers", "black"], "polarity": 0.10657730838765322, "subjectivity": 0.4662252243286725},

Lockhart wrote Monday for vox.com. \u201cOn its face, this doesn\u2019t sound like anything special, but there was something unique about the majority of the people in the room that day: They were mostly black women.\u201dThe mood was jubilant, largely because the night prior, Democrat Doug Jones bested Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama special election, ending a 25-year losing streak for Democratic Senate candidates in the state. Exit polls showed that Jones\u2019s victory was largely due to the high turnout of black voters, especially black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe event began as the results from the election were still trending on Twitter, with streams of praise for #BlackWomen\u2019s performance in the Alabama contest. \u2018What if we just let black women run everything?\u2019 read one popular tweet. . . .\u201d\n\nLockhart also wrote, \u201cWith the beginning of a new year, especially one that will end with a highly anticipated midterm election, the Alabama result offers hope for Democrats eager to regain political power in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cBut for black women, the post-Alabama moment also presents an additional opportunity, a potential turning point in how they are treated in political circles. Both parties have been reminded yet again that black women have been a consistently reliable bloc for the Democrats. In 2018, black women say they want to see a return on their investment. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary C.

It is very hard for large and powerful institutions to undermine their own power and authority. Foucault noted that in his writings. The status-quo is quite comfortable for an institution. Is there an incentive for tribal government to present a perfect image of itself? Absolutely. Does this present an incentive to fudge the facts? It absolutely does. Newsletters are for tribal-programs. Tribal-governments should work with the independent media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, it is always important to be clear, I do not believe our elected officials are inherently corrupt, nor do I believe that the creation of this publication was brought about with nefarious intent. What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["hook", "tour", "america", "violent", "rates", "nearly", "law", "increase", "continues", "enforcement", "drug", "dishonest", "sessions", "crime", "safe", "watch"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

And when the time arrives for these hits to be carried out you\u2019re not going to see a C.I.A. agent with a suit and tie, and a badge that says C.I.A. walk up to someone, and pull the trigger. What they will do is to out-source to local police departments in the region of their target, and to employ those that look like the target of interest to infiltrate the workings in order to set up the environment for the eventual assassination (character, physical/incarceration, exile) to take place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI immediately thought of young Malcolm\u2019s words when, on July 6, 2016, Philando Castile was killed in broad daylight by St. Anthony, Minn., Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez. I thought of his words not because I believe that Castile was specifically the target of a CIA plot, but because the public assassination of black humanity\u2014and the character of black people\u2014has been an ongoing project in this white-settler colonial project that flag wavers call the greatest country on earth.\n\n\n\nThe way we look, the way we talk, the way we attempt to live free in a country founded on our violent oppression, have all been reasons successfully used to render us \u201ckillable\u201d in the eyes of society and to justify our state-sanctioned lynchings.\n\n\u201c ... the character assassination before the physical assassination; so one has to be made killable before the eyes of the public in order for their eventual murder to then be deemed justifiable.\u201d \u2014Malcolm Shabazz\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are born into this world with targets on our backs and often leave this world the same way. Castile had already been pulled over an estimated 46 times before Yanez claimed that the 32-year-old man\u2019s \u201cwide-set nose\u201d made him look like a criminal suspect. Further, he was a legal gun owner in a nation that weaponizes blackness and steals black lives but loves steel weapons.\n\nWhen Castile calmly and respectfully explained that he had a gun in the car, the trigger-happy Yanez \u201cfeared for his life\u201d because a black man with a gun has always been viewed as a clear and present danger. This nation assigns us to that category so that state-sanctioned executions will be deemed necessary. And for those scarce times when blackness alone does not give officers a license to kill, marijuana smoke conjures up the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports:\n\n\u201cI thought, I was gonna die,\u201d Officer Jeronimo Yanez told investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension fifteen hours after the shooting. \u201cAnd I thought if he\u2019s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girl was screaming.\u201d\n\nA wide-nosed black man in a car that allegedly smelled of marijuana had the audacity to carry a legal gun; that made him an enemy of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillable.\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs has been used to escalate a general sense that black people are beasts and that our communities are urban jungles,\u201d asha bandele, senior director of Drug Policy Alliance, told The Root.\n\n\u201cThroughout so many of these horrific police shootings, drugs have been used to justify the slaughter of innocents,\u201d bandele continued. \u201cWe saw it with Michael Brown, we saw it with Trayvon Martin, we saw it with shootings throughout the country, including that of Philando Castile. All you have to do is raise the specter of drugs, and supposedly no other question is supposed to be asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes when drugs are not the issue itself, the criminalization, the use of drugs, drug selling and drug use\u2014a criminalized feature in our nation\u2014is used to justify killing,\u201d bandele continued.\n\nKillable.\n\nBandele points out that the war on drugs is a living, breathing manifestation of the hatred this country holds for black people, and a cover for police hypermilitization and the occupation of black and brown communities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce you declare something a war, you got to declare someone an enemy,\u201d bandele told The Root. The drug war has been used as a justification for police killings of 92-year-old grandmothers in their homes, where all they had to say was, \u2018Oops, wrong house.\u2019 It\u2019s been used to justify the killings of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of war and the continuous war crimes that shape this war directly led to the lynching of Philando Castile,\u201d bandele said.\n\nBandele, like Malcolm Shabazz, was also clear that sometimes skinfolk are used to weed out members of the black community that some people find disposable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to understand how we contribute to deaths like Philando Castile\u2019s when we contribute to stigmatizing people, or determining who\u2019s a decent black person and who\u2019s not a decent black person,\u201d bandele said. \u201cWe may have, in progressive communities, a broader idea of who matters and who doesn\u2019t, but until we accept that every life has value and we see that in our communities, then we\u2019re almost participating in who they say they can kill, and who they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKillable.\n\nThis is why, bandele says, ending the war on drugs, dismantling white supremacy brick by brick and eradicating stigma is the necessary foundational work we need to engage in if we are ever to be free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we want to begin to roll back police militarization significantly, we have to work to end the drug war,\u201d bandele said. \u201cIf we want to disrupt a major tool that they can wield against us, in not only killing us, but them not being held accountable for killing us, we have to end the drug war. If we want to begin to disrupt extraordinary levels of black poverty, then we have to begin to end the drug war.\n\n\u201cIn doing that,\u201d bandele continued, \u201cwe will say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to spend money on over-incarceration or over-surveillance, or any of the other facets that make up mass criminalization. We\u2019re not going to have one more Philando Castile.

Whereas Rebel, with a woman orchestrating the beatdowns, struck more as a modern-day reimagining of the iconic Shaft (which Singleton revamped on the big screen with Samuel L. Jackson nearly 20 years ago), Snowfall raises the stakes considerably. Singleton, who co-created the series, aims to tell the story of one of the most devastating eras in modern black American history\u2014the crack cocaine period. And for the Los Angeles native, this story is very personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s something that has affected so many different people\u2019s lives, that transition from cocaine being a recreational drug for the very well-to-do to it turning into crack, an epidemic that basically affected our communities with people being addicted and also selling, and also changing the drug laws so they can put a whole generation of us in prison,\u201d he told The Root exclusively via telephone during an Uber ride in L.A. \u201cSo it\u2019s really kind of a horror story as far as I\u2019m concerned because, when you talk about crack, it\u2019s like World War II for black people if you lived it.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s the only thing that made black women leave their children,\u201d he says of the epidemic. \u201cSlavery didn\u2019t do it. Jim Crow didn\u2019t do it, but crack did it.\u201d\n\nA lot of Snowfall is a prequel to the crack plague. It\u2019s a different time, one with a slight touch of innocence. The music is even different. \u201cHip-hop hadn\u2019t hit yet,\u201d says Singleton of the early-\u201980s-era series. \u201cWe were all into funk records\u2014Gap Band, Lakeside, Rufus and Chaka Khan\u2014and that\u2019s what the show reflects.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe character of Franklin Saint, a star turn for England\u2019s latest theatrical import, Damson Idris, is a bright teenager who has forgone college away to stick close to his mother, Cissy Saint (The Wire alum Michael Hyatt). In addition to holding down a basic job, he sells weed for his uncle Jerome (Amin Joseph), his mother\u2019s brother. But Franklin has grander ambitions. Busing to a better school puts him in circles he never could have accessed. He sees an opportunity to grow rich in the new drug game with some of the purest cocaine around. Naivete is his biggest mistake, however.\n\nBecause it\u2019s L.A., there\u2019s a Latinx story to tell as well. At the same time Franklin is making moves, so is Lucia Villanueva, played by Emily Rios of Friday Night Lights and Breaking Bad fame. Daring to carve out a role for herself in the family\u2019s drug cartel, Lucia leans on Gustavo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), a frustrated wrestler seeking a better life.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all is the CIA and the controversial claim that the federal agency helped finance the war in Nicaragua by flooding L.A.\u2019s black community with cheap and potent cocaine. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb exposed this connection in a three-part series that ran in the San Jose Mercury News in 1996 but was later discredited, and he was reportedly pushed out of journalism. Webb\u2019s 2004 death by two gunshots to the head was ruled a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of stuff written about this time, especially on the West Coast,\u201d says Singleton. \u201cYou have stuff on the East Coast and definitely in the Latin culture, in South Florida.\u201d That didn\u2019t deter Singleton, his co-creator Eric Amadio and the rest of the team from telling a story that Singleton deems vital.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to think \u2018OK, hey, cocaine is so, so sexy, but crack, crack is not sexy. It\u2019s wack,\u201d he chuckles, without drowning out the seriousness of his words. \u201cCrack has never been sexy, but you\u2019re going to see that transition and how dangerous it gets getting into the game [in Snowfall]. Cocaine is always glamorized in certain ways, but this story has never ever been told before. Ever,\u201d he re-emphasizes.\n\nFX got a lot of our attention last year with the Emmy Award-winning series The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which garnered Singleton his first Emmy nomination for directing its critical \u201cRace Card\u201d episode. There is a cinematic feel to Snowfall that feeds the growing intensity of each episode. Snowfall also pushes the limits, explained Singleton. \u201cThere\u2019s partial nudity. There\u2019s cursing. It\u2019s a little more violent than usual,\u201d he noted while flanked by most of Snowfall\u2019s cast at last month\u2019s American Black Film Festival in Miami.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in L.A., Singleton dismisses descriptions of Snowfall as \u201cThe Wire meets Narcos,\u201d insisting that that\u2019s \u201can easy generalization,\u201d adding that Snowfall is \u201cnothing like either one of those shows.\u201d Although he emphasizes, \u201cthose are great shows,\u201d he says Snowfall is \u201cits own thing.\u201d\n\nSingleton will cop to Snowfall being \u201cthe ghetto Game of Thrones,\u201d crediting his largely unknown cast for helping him achieve that effect. \u201cThese new faces work so well because you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s expendable, who\u2019s going to make it through.\u201d\n\nSnowfall debuts Wednesday at 10 p.m. on FX.", "keywords": ["fx", "snowfall", "crack", "theres", "la", "overtook", "drug", "series", "cocaine", "john", "lot", "sexy", "singleton", "black"], "polarity": 0.08436494897338272, "subjectivity": 0.49774387593664693},

We delved into the numbers and reiterated that poverty, police and prisons are forms of structural violence that have been thrust upon black, brown and indigenous communities in the service of white supremacist patriarchal capitalism\u2014that the shame is not ours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no conspiracy that this nation, which holds itself in such high esteem, despite being the prison warden of the world, has conspired against the very communities that were forced to build it on their backs.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance reports:\n\nPeople of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system and are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record. This is particularly the case for drug-law violations.\n\nNearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.\n\nResearch shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory-minimum sentence for black people than for white people charged with the same offense. Among people who received a mandatory-minimum sentence in 2011, 38 percent were Latino and 31 percent were black.\n\nBlack people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups. They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs. Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police-community interactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the color of pain is black, and it is neither fatalistic nor nihilistic to come to that conclusion. It is neither a diminishing nor rejection of black joy, black resilience or black futures to make that plain. From draconian drug policies to disenfranchisement, money-bail bond systems to civil-asset forfeiture, food and housing instability to police officers killing black people with impunity\u2014and preying on vulnerable black women simply because they can\u2014this system was designed to enslave black people and ration out freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, what does justice look like within a white supremacist police state that lies to itself about the depth of its own character?

She\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without acknowledging that the Nixon administration camouflaged its war on black people by causing hysteria around drugs, nor without acknowledging the Jim Crow era drug policies that continue to define Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without discussing mass incarceration, the disappearing of black men into the jaws of the criminal (in)justice system, the vilification of black mothers suffering through addiction, and the state-sponsored police slaying of black children.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore that the drug war has influenced everything from inhumane immigration policies to racist housing policies. We can\u2019t ignore that generational poverty has been equated to moral bankruptcy in this country; nor can we ignore that harm reduction for some working-class or poor black people is less about battling addiction, and more about navigating institutionalized, systemic anti-blackness. Grief, trauma, addiction, stigma, punishment: This is the cycle that must be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some black people, it is an act of self-perseverance to point to black people doing well by most metrics and say, \u201cLook, all of us aren\u2019t selling weed or living in the hood or in jail.\u201d And it is this line of classist, condescending thinking that led many black people to support tough-on-crime/tough-on-drugs legislation under both President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton without looking at the oppressive conditions that often lead to both. In this country, more than any other, violent drug policy has been carved out of black flesh.\n\nThe color of pain is black, but so is the color of freedom.\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique said. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledge.\n\nAtone.\n\nAct.\n\nThat is what Color of Pain\u2014a Drug Policy Alliance initiative spearheaded by Frederique and Dionna King, policy manager at the New York office of the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014is demanding: Reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Drug Policy Alliance\n\nThe Color of Pain website is an invaluable resource for us all.

The law specifically said that \u201clegalization of illegal drugs is an unconscionable surrender in the war on drugs.\u201d When it was reauthorized in 1998, Congress stipulated that no federal funds be used to study the legalization of marijuana or other Schedule I drugs and that the office had to \u201coppose any attempt to legalize\u201d cannabis.\n\nUnder Obama, officials in the department seriously considered ending the federal prohibition on marijuana. While they didn\u2019t consider making it legal and easily available, former ONDCP Deputy Director Thomas McLellan said that the office was \u201cin favor of decriminalizing but not legalizing.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s hands were ultimately tied by the laws that made the office possible. \u201cIt forced the office to take a policy position that it may or may not agree to,\u201d said Michael Botticelli, former director of the drug czar\u2019s office. Botticelli added that the legislation \u201chamstrings you into a policy position that might be the policy of the day but that might change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the language that created their office, ONDCP officials couldn\u2019t even give their honest opinion about marijuana legislation, which made them look either ignorant of the overwhelming research or hypocritical in the eyes of scientists, criminal-reform advocates and marijuana activists. They were forced to publicly advocate against studying the issue or considering alternatives.\n\nObama\u2019s drug-czar office was also concerned that decriminalization would obstruct its efforts to solve the opioid epidemic that was creeping across the country. Constrained by the letter of the law, the administration took a more nuanced approach. The Justice Department instructed prosecutors to seek the minimum penalty for nonviolent drug offenses. They advocated against mandatory minimums. They increased funding for treatment and education.\n\nWashington, D.C., offered a rare glimpse into the administration\u2019s stance, however. The D.C. City Council\u2019s laws must be approved by Congress, so when District residents voted to legalize marijuana, Botticelli said, \u201cI might not agree about legalization, but I do agree with our own ability to spend our own money the way that we want to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legalization of marijuana is not simply a topic of public health debate; it is also a social justice and criminal-reform issue. While studies show that blacks and whites use pot at about the same rate, the American Civil Liberties Union says that African Americans are about four times more likely to be arrested for possession. A 2013 University of Michigan study showed that blacks are twice as likely as whites to be charged with a crime that carries a mandatory minimum sentence in similar circumstances. The Sarasota Herald Tribune studied unequal sentencing in Florida and found:\n\nIn Manatee County, judges sentence whites convicted of felony drug possession to an average of five months behind bars. They give blacks with identical charges and records more than a year.\n\nThere is someone who could fix this. On May 15, Congress sent a bill to committee to reauthorize the ONDCP. Maybe the one person who could fix this will step in and pressure his party to end the idiocy that is marijuana prohibition.

This Black History Month, The Root, in partnership with Drug Policy Alliance, takes a deep look at why the war on drugs cannot be divorced from generational poverty, the carceral state and white supremacy.\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to grow, so, too, does the realization that black and brown, poor and working-class communities most harmed by the so-called war on drugs do not have access to this new gold rush.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe profiteers of this war\u2014this storefront operation created for the sole purpose of laundering the institutional, systemic, coordinated assaults on black and brown communities\u2014are primarily white men with access to capital who navigate society unencumbered by the intentional violence of the carceral state. This, subsequently, gives them the freedom to be legal drug dealers, while jails across the nation continue to be filled with black and brown people incarcerated for low-level drug crimes\u2014if police officers don\u2019t get to them first.\n\nThat might be how this white supremacist capitalist system was intended to function, but the Hood Incubator has something else in mind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormed in 2017 in Oakland, Calif., the Hood Incubator, founded by Ebele Ifedigbo, 29, and Lanese Martin, 32, was created in response to the state\u2019s marijuana legalization in order to create pathways to ownership in the cannabis industry for black and brown people most harmed by the drug war.\n\nThe community-centered organization is committed to \u201cbuilding economic and political power for black and brown communities,\u201d and is well on the way to radically transforming an industry guarded by white gatekeepers.\n\n\u201cWhile marijuana use is roughly equal among black[s] and whites nationwide, black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession,\u201d the Hood Incubator states on its website. \u201cNow that cannabis is a thriving $8 billion legal industry [pdf], black people make up less than 5 percent [pdf] of founders and business owners.\n\nIn the interview that follows, Ifedigbo talks to the The Root about the difficulties they\u2019ve faced in shattering racialized stigmas attached to cannabis, breaking through institutionalized barriers, abolition, and why it\u2019s necessary for black and brown people to be at the forefront of the cannabis industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: When I think of the word \u201cincubator,\u201d the concept of incubation in the context of the hood, I think of distilling, healing, growing, becoming, protecting. Explain to me why it is important to you that black people, who have been most severely harmed by the drug war, have access to the growing cannabis industry?\n\n\n\nEbele Ifedigbo: It\u2019s important that black people have access to the growing cannabis industry precisely because we have been the most harmed by cannabis prohibition. There\u2019s the adage of \u201cmore risk, more reward\u201d when it comes to economics and investments. That same principle should hold true when it comes to the marijuana industry: Black communities have objectively taken on the vast majority of the risk and negative consequences associated with marijuana being illegal. We are four times more likely to be arrested for weed-related offenses than white people, despite the fact that marijuana use is equal across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have taken on those consequences and it has had heartbreaking systematic outcomes for our families and communities. So, now, as the industry is legalizing and growing like wildfire, projected to be $20 billion by 2020, black communities should be at the forefront of accessing the rewards and resources that come along with that legalization and growth.\n\nTR: In a nation that renders economically exploited black and brown people disposable, what are some of the institutional barriers you\u2019ve faced in trying to arm our communities with the knowledge and licensure it requires to sell cannabis legally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEI: In the process of developing the model for the Hood Incubator, we did extensive research and perspective gathering to make sure our work effectively addresses the barriers that our people are truly facing. Between Lanese using her background in community organizing and political organizing to do on-the-ground community organizing\u2014hosting early member meetings, attending council meetings with impacted residents, connecting people in different parts of the informal industry\u2014and my census and economic-data-based research, we were able to really hone in on the institutional barriers our folks are up against.\n\nWe found that, almost across the board, black and brown communities face barriers in accessing the 1) networks, 2) technical support and assistance, and 3) financial capital it takes to thrive in the legal industry.\n\nThe legal marijuana space is still very new, so \u201cwho you know\u201d is still a primary success factor. Are you connected to lawmakers? Are you connected to influential investors? Are you backed by community members? It is very difficult to thrive and compete in the marketplace if you are operating in isolation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the state of the market, it is imperative that business owners surround themselves with a community of advisers, subject-matter experts and supporters who can help the business successfully navigate and make decisions in a rapidly growing and fast-paced, but also highly regulated, volatile and risky industry.\n\nOftentimes, black and brown people are cut off from these networks and knowledge bases, or it takes us longer to build the relationships, and that dampens our [collective] ability to keep up in the marijuana industry.\n\nAt the same time, the networks and knowledge bases that we have been able to resiliently amass over time in the informal marijuana industry are often judged negatively when assessed within the traditional frameworks of \u201centrepreneurial success,\u201d and that is used to justify our exclusion from industry opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccess to financial capital is key, too. The marijuana business is capital intensive. The fact that the industry still operates in a gray area only adds to the cost of doing business and makes it more difficult to attract investment across the board. Entrepreneurs need financial capital to endure the ups and downs of the market and grow their businesses over time. But nationwide, less than 1 percent of venture capital funding goes to black founders. From our experiences, black founders in the marijuana industry are facing similar financial barriers.\n\n\n\nThat said, right now we have a wide-open opportunity to address these institutional barriers and shift the narrative. The key question is: How do we create a marijuana industry that fundamentally centers the interests of communities that have taken on the risks that have allowed for the legal industry to even exist in the first place? That is the work that the Hood Incubator takes on. We are working to make that vision real by centering black and brown communities in all the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: One of the things that I\u2019ve witnessed is a kind of internalized hatred and fear and stigma that attaches cannabis to poverty and black criminality. There are some in our communities who believe \u201cjust saying no\u201d is what \u201crespectable\u201d black folks do. Have you witnessed this in your work\u2014and, if so, how have you worked to dismantle those perceptions?\n\n\n\nEI: Yes, we have come across these perspectives in our work. We welcome people with all different perspectives because we recognize that everyone is coming to this marijuana conversation with different experiences and assessments of what marijuana represents and what the promise of the industry is (or is not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that, at the end of the day, if you are black, you have experienced negative impacts from the drug war, either directly or indirectly. And that gives your voice, your questions and your concerns an inherent weight and legitimacy that cannot be denied.\n\nWe create a culture at the Hood Incubator where any of our community members can come to learn and discuss the plant and the industry amongst peers. As a community, when we share our stories and perspectives amongst ourselves, we are all able to both teach and learn in equal measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen engaging folks who are wary of cannabis and what it represents, we center the core promise of the industry. For the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power, especially given the fact that we have paid and continue to pay the costs that it has taken to get to this moment in the legalization movement.\n\nWe believe it would be a huge mistake to shy away from doing the necessary groundwork to ensure that we actually access the tangible economic and sociopolitical benefits that the industry can offer our communities.\n\nWhether an individual chooses personally to consume the plant or not, it is hard to deny the opportunity we have to build something greater from this industry\u2014a legacy of intergenerational wealth and economic sustainability for black families and communities nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power.\n\nTR: This is not just about policy; it is about restorative and transformative justice\u2014and what you are doing is revolutionary. So many black people are still incarcerated, communities decimated, while white people reap the benefits of a narrative shift that has taken place on the backs of black folks. How important is abolition in your work?\n\nEI: As an organization we\u2019re deeply rooted in an understanding of the atrocities of mass incarceration and over-criminalization of black people. When it comes to marijuana, black people are four times more likely to be arrested for a cannabis-related offense then white people, despite equal rates of use across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary. We believe that people are inherently motivated to make positive contributions in society as long as they have all of the resources and support they need. If we can create the set of conditions where everyone has what they need, then we will have no need for a prison system. In our work, we center the principles of access, healing, opportunity and restorative justice.\n\nTR: Where do you see the Hood Incubator and the cannabis industry in five years?\n\nEI: In five years, we see the Hood Incubator operating nationally. Our growth strategy is to go deep in Oakland, in the Bay Area, and in California so we can learn what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and create models of best practice that can be replicated and implemented in cities and states around the country over the next five years. We want to play a key role in shaping what equity means in the marijuana industry, and we plan to support the various stakeholders\u2014community organizations, lawmakers, industry operators\u2014to be effective in the implementation of cannabis-equity initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want initiatives and frameworks that just sound good, we want frameworks that can fundamentally transform power dynamics and effectively turn the marijuana plant from a weapon that has been used to decimate black and under-resourced communities, into a tool that can help to repair the harms we have experienced from the drug war and mass incarceration.\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d Instead, we will be proud of the work that we\u2019ve done collectively to shape the industry in a positive way that ensures justice and real economic opportunity for black and brown communities.\n\nClick here to support the Hood Incubator by becoming a monthly sustainer.\n\n", "keywords": ["cannabis", "communities", "hood", "work", "organization", "drug", "ownership", "calif", "brown", "oakland", "industry", "marijuana", "incubator", "empowers", "black"], "polarity": 0.10657730838765322, "subjectivity": 0.4662252243286725},

Hart also did not shy away from fiercely criticizing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, known for spearheading a deadly war on drugs in his country.\n\n\n\nDuterte became furious when reporters asked him about Hart\u2019s statements, calling Hart a \u201cfool\u201d and rejecting his research as nothing more than American \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Hart] said shabu does not damage the brain. That\u2019s why that son of a bitch who has gone crazy came here to make announcements,\u201d Duterte told Philstar. (\u201cShabu\u201d is a slang term used in Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to describe methamphetamine.)\n\nAgnes Callamard, the director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University and a United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, is an opponent of Duterte\u2019s drug war.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallamard, who also spoke during the policy forum, quoted one of Hart\u2019s points on Twitter. This resulted in Duterte slamming her as being in collusion with \u201cthat black guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should go [on] a honeymoon with that black guy, the American. I will pay for their travel,\u201d Duterte told reporters at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. \u201cThey should be together and discuss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his decadeslong research on drug addiction, Hart has openly discussed his experimentation with methamphetamine. He has also been unrelenting in cutting through stigmatizing rhetoric that has, in large part, fueled the war on drugs. He never wavers in pointing out the similarities between the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug Adderall and meth, as well as presenting evidence that cocaine and tobacco have similar effects on the fetus.\n\nTwo of the above substances are legal: Adderall, which is beloved by Big Pharma, and tobacco, which has been legally pushed in black and brown communities (pdf) for decades while discriminatory drug policies\u2014specifically around crack and marijuana\u2014have been used to terrorize and occupy those same communities.\n\nHart fearlessly pushes back against respectability politics and shame in black communities, demanding a shift in dialogue that includes human beings having autonomy over what they put into their own bodies; following the data on what is dangerous to consume and in what quantities; realizing that not all drug use is problematic; zeroing in on the drug war as an intentional and institutional war on the most vulnerable, oppressed and marginalized communities both domestic and abroad; and calling out state violence, specifically hypermilitarized policing, as more dangerous for black people than drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe most important conversation that I have with [my sons], in terms of drugs, is they are more likely to be arrested for drugs than their white friends,\u201d Hart said in conversation with asha bandele, senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance, during a Facebook Live chat on The Root.\n\n\u201cThe most potential negative impact or consequence is the police, not the drugs themselves,\u201d Hart continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s 2016 partner-gathering at Columbia University, Hart also urged attendees not to be distracted by the simplistic, media-driven narrative of a \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs.\n\n\u201cThey may be gentler on the [white] user, but black people are disproportionately arrested for the selling of opiates,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s comfortable to arrest black and brown bodies. Always pay attention to who\u2019s getting arrested.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is one thing that Hart always does, it\u2019s make it plain; being in the Philippines, of course, didn\u2019t change that.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Duterte signed an executive order in February authorizing the creation of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs.\n\nICAD consists of at least 21 state agencies, from \u201cpolice, military and coast guard to health, education and social welfare.\u201d Though the government claims that the purpose of the multipronged agency is to rehabilitate users and suppress dealers large and small, it has disproportionately targeted impoverished communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 8,000 people have been killed since the drugs crackdown started eight months ago, 2,555 of them in what police say were shootouts during raids. [ICAD] says that 48,000 drugs suspects were arrested,\u201d Reuters reports. Duterte has reportedly threatened to kill more.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nBe clear: From the U.S., to Mexico, to Honduras, to Ghana, to Thailand, to the Philippines, the war on drugs is global.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Democracy Now! interview, Hart talked about the death threats he received for unpacking the misleading rhetoric around shabu and for speaking out against Duterte\u2019s drug war in the Philippines.\n\nFrom Democracy Now!:\n\nWhen I was in the Philippines, the thing that I discovered is that it\u2019s a lot worse than I originally thought it was. Duterte operates in intimidation. And so, not only is he the problem, but there are other political officials who are afraid to speak out. They are the problem. And Duterte has taken a page out of the 1980s U.S. drug war in that he\u2019s using drugs to separate people, the issue of drugs to separate the poor people from the people who have means. And he is allowing or providing the environment so people could kill, as you pointed out, kill people who are engaged in drug use and in drug trafficking. And people are afraid to speak out against this wrong because Duterte has no qualms about having people\u2019s lives be threatened. In fact, I discovered that people are being killed for as little as $100. It ranges from about $100 to $500 to have someone killed. And so, actually, I left the Philippines early because my life was threatened because of me speaking out against what Duterte was saying about drugs and what he\u2019s doing. And so, we have it bad in the United States, but the Philippines, I have never seen anything like the Philippines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the entire interview below:\n\nPredictably, neither Donald Trump nor anyone in his regime has repudiated Duterte\u2019s vile statements about Hart, a U.S. citizen; nor has he voiced any concern about the death threats the acclaimed scientist has received.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Trump recently praised Duterte, gushed over their \u201cvery friendly\u201d conversations and invited him to the White House over vehement objections from human rights groups.\n\nGIven that Hart is equally vocal in his opposition to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 blatant push to escalate the drug war in the United States, Trump\u2019s silence should come as no surprise.\n\nTruth tellers such as Hart continue to put their lives on the line to end this inhumane war that has cost so many so much. History tells us that threats against black leaders deemed dangerous by those in power are rarely idle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be thankful for Hart\u2019s life and his continued revolutionary work.", "keywords": ["president", "war", "crazy", "hart", "black", "university", "philippines", "policy", "guy", "drug", "drugs", "gone", "neuroscientist", "son", "duterte", "threats", "speaking"], "polarity": -0.03149721706864564, "subjectivity": 0.43651473922902484},

First, create and sustain oppressive conditions for poor, black and brown communities. Implement policing tactics and drug policies that criminalize already pathologized poor, black and brown people\u2014people who are never presumed innocent in the eyes of society nor the law.\n\nMake it so that \u201claw and order\u201d dictates incarceration for the pettiest of crimes\u2014indeed, racialize crime itself\u2014then give people the option to either stay in jail or pay for their freedom as they await court dates that are often egregiously delayed. This often means paying private bail bondsmen a nonrefundable fee\u20141o percent of the total bail set\u2014to avoid sitting behind bars.\n\nIf one has the financial means, the choice is clear. If one does not, which is often the case by design, it can be a matter of life and death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was the case for Kalief Browder, who in 2010 was arrested and charged with grand larceny for the alleged theft of a backpack. Kalief was only 16 years old when he was locked away in New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex for more than 1,000 days, almost 800 of those days spent in solitary confinement. Despite being repeatedly, viciously, psychologically and physically assaulted while in jail, Kalief refused to plead guilty to a crime he did not commit.\n\nAfter appearing in court more than 30 times and attempting suicide at least five times, Kalief was eventually released in 2013 when his case was dismissed because of lack of evidence. But irreparable damage had been done. On June 6, 2015, Kalief Browder hanged himself from his bedroom window. He was only 22 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis mother, Venida Browder, suffered a fatal heart attack in October 2016. Cause of death: a broken heart. The state had stolen her son away from his family, snatched him off the street like a predator, and she could not afford the $3,000 ransom it demanded in exchange for his freedom.\n\nThis was also the case with Sandra Bland. On July 9, 2015, Texas State Trooper Brian Encinia pulled her over for allegedly failing to signal before switching lanes. Bland had the nerve to be free in his presence\u2014had the nerve to know her rights. Encinia physically assaulted her before placing her under arrest for allegedly resisting arrest, when his real problem was that she had resisted the racist and gendered notion that she didn\u2019t have autonomy over her own body, or the right to navigate the world freely in it.\n\n\n\nBland was held in the Waller County, Texas, jail because she could not afford the $500 price tag placed on her freedom. On July 13, 2015, she was found hanging in her jail cell under suspicious circumstances. She was 28 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere can be no doubt: This money-bail system\u2014a blood-sucking beast that devours any pretense of justice\u2014not only disrupts black lives but also renders black bodies disposable commodities.\n\nAccording to the Prison Policy Initiative, more than \u201c2.3 million people in the U.S are incarcerated in 1,719 state prisons, 102 federal prisons, 901 juvenile correctional facilities, 3,163 local jails, and 76 Indian Country jails as well as in military prisons, immigration detention facilities, civil commitment centers, and prisons in the U.S. territories.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite men have the highest incomes before incarceration, while black women have the lowest incomes before incarceration, PPI reports. Black men in jail have a preincarceration median income 64 percent lower than that of their nonincarcerated counterparts.\n\nThere are more than 11 million jail arrests made in the U.S. each year; at any given time, approximately 70 percent of the total jail population has not been convicted of a crime. They either cannot afford bail, or they will make bail in a few hours or days. The New York Times reports that in New York City, even when bail is set at $500 or less, 85 percent of defendants were unable to afford bail.\n\nFurther, even though there are significantly fewer drug convictions on the state and local levels, compared with federal prisons, that does not stop drug arrests from being made in predominantly poor, working-class, black and brown communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2015, 87 percent of defendants in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court had to post bail in order to be released, The Nation\u2019s Dani McClain reports. She writes that \u201cof the defendants who could afford to post bail, 97 percent used a bail bondsman. New Orleans bondsmen earned $4.7 million in payments from defendants that year.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, this is nothing short of modern-day debtors\u2019 prisons. In addition to not being able to afford bail, incarcerated people have to contend with a \u201cpay to stay\u201d scheme that also holds them responsible for their room, board, clothing and medical treatment. Poor people are expected to finance their own confinement, even though the vast majority of them wouldn\u2019t be behind bars if they could afford their freedom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe racism embedded in this process is clear.\n\nUCLA\u2019s Million Dollar Hoods research team recently released a report (pdf) that detailed the bias and bigotry inherent in requiring money bail from poor people who pose a low risk to society. According to the report, in Los Angeles:\n\n\n\nOf the $193.8 million paid to bail bond agents, Latinos paid $92.1 million, African Americans paid $40.7 million, and whites paid $37.9 million. But a recent study by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights documents that it is women\u2014the mothers, aunts, grandmothers, friends and wives of the accused\u2014who are most likely to contract with a bail bond agent on behalf of those in custody. If so, the estimated $193.8 [million] paid in nonrefundable bail bond deposits were disproportionately paid by women, namely black women and Latinas. Moreover, each community likely paid much more when accounting for post-arraignment payments, the service fees charged by bail bond companies, and, in some cases, asset seizures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only are black women 44 percent of the nation\u2019s jail population (pdf), but they are too often left carrying the financial, psychological and emotional weight when the state comes for their partners.\n\nIn 2017, the Pretrial Justice Institute released a state scorecard grading states\u2019 pretrial systems, and the sobering numbers reveal the sheer scope of this inhumane infrastructure with tentacles throughout the country.\n\n\n\nAlabama is one of the states in the deep South that scored an F, but because of intense grassroots efforts, change is visible. Equal Justice Under Law has worked to ensure the end of the money-bail system in seven communities, including Clanton and Dothan, Ala., where the Rev. Kenneth Glasgow, founder and president of the Ordinary People Society, has worked for decades against the disenfranchisement of formerly incarcerated people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlasgow has also been on the front line of the bail-reform efforts in Dothan, partnering last year with Southerners on New Ground, which is led by black lesbian feminist organizer Mary Hooks, to bail out black mothers in time for Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nMore than 25 organizations joined SONG\u2019s massive, revolutionary action (pdf), including the Movement for Black Lives, Project NIA, Color of Change and Dream Defenders. The National Bailout Campaign has since grown to include the LGBTQ+ community and has shifted the narrative around mass incarceration and mass criminalization in this nation.\n\nAnd Alabama is not the only state where change is brewing.\n\nIn 2016, a federal class action lawsuit filed by Equal Justice Under Law and the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law against Jackson, Miss., ended with a settlement that effectively ended the misdemeanor money-bail system in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, a federal judge ruled the money-bail system in Harris County, Texas, to be unconstitutional. Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, the Civil Rights Corps and the Texas Fair Defense Project have filed a class action suit against Dallas County\u2019s money-bail system.\n\nNowhere has progress been more evident than in the state of New Jersey, the only state to score an A on the Pretrial Justice Institute\u2019s state scorecard.\n\nDrug Policy Alliance created the New Solutions Campaign in 2008 in response to New Jersey\u2019s \u201cthen out-of-control prison growth.\u201d A 2013 DPA report (pdf) found that almost 40 percent of the individuals being held in New Jersey jails were there solely because they could not afford to pay bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed comprehensive bail-reform legislation, which went into effect in January 2017. By the end of May, \u201cjail populations across the state had declined 19 percent ... a 36 percent drop statewide compared to May of 2015\u2014with declines of as much as 49 percent in some counties.\u201d\n\nThese victories cannot be overstated, but pushback to progress is inevitable in a white supremacist capitalist nation built on genocide, land theft and slavery. For example, because of \u201ctechnical violations,\u201d which may include failure to pay a fine, the prison population continues to grow in Mississippi despite bail reforms. And Houston Council Member Michael Kubosh, who also happens to be a bail bondsman, criticized the ending of Harris County\u2019s money-bail system as \u201cgiving criminals a get-out-of-jail-free card\u201d\u2014as if it is not criminal for a public figure to have a private, financial interest in which way public policy swings.\n\n\n\nThese victories cannot be overstated, but pushback to progress is inevitable in a white supremacist capitalist nation built on genocide, land theft and slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is about much more than numbers; it is about communities collapsing under a brutal weight that has been on them for generations. It is about the lacerated legacies of people who are trapped in cycles of poverty and debt they were never meant to break. It is about occupation and punishment; inequity and discrimination.\n\nIt is about slavery shape-shifting so that institutions can still profit off the bodies of black people.\n\nAttempting to reform a system that is not broken, but working exactly as intended, will forever be a Herculean task. Prison abolition is required for true restorative and transformative justice to be achieved, but until that day comes, it is imperative that poor, working-class, black and brown communities are not forced into illegal debtors\u2019 prisons solely to maintain the very systems hell-bent on destroying them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting on Feb. 14\u2014Black Love Day\u2014organizations working to #EndMoneyBail and pretrial detention in Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia and Los Angeles, as well as Alabama and Texas, will coordinate a month of \u201cBail Outs\u201d in observance of Black History Month and International Women\u2019s Month.\n\nThe coalition of organizations has published a tool kit encouraging communities to bail out black people who would otherwise languish in jail because they are unable to afford bail.

The new guidelines state that \u201cprosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\u201d later defining such offenses as \u201cthose that carry the most substantial ... sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d\n\nBefore issuing the directive, Sessions informed federal prison officials that they should expect the rates of incarceration to rise, although the Justice Department did not elaborate on whether Sessions made the phone call while wearing his Klansman\u2019s hood or if he simply turned it to the side and listened through the eyeholes.\n\nThe policy is an about-face from the Obama-era Justice Department led by Holder. To avoid triggering mandatory minimums, Holder explicitly forbade prosecutors from reporting the quantity of drugs involved in cases with nonviolent offenders not affiliated with gangs or drug cartels. The Obama administration sought to reduce the federal prison population by ending the decadeslong war on drugs.\n\nA 2012 study by the University of Michigan Law School found that prosecutors were twice as likely to file charges carrying mandatory minimums against blacks (pdf) as they were against whites. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (pdf) and the United States Sentencing Commission (pdf), blacks and whites use drugs at about the same rates, but blacks are six times more likely to do prison time for illegal drug use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, every scientific study ever done shows that incarceration rates have no correlation with lowering drug use, but like most Republicans, the gargoyle DNA embedded in Sessions\u2019 blood probably won\u2019t allow his troglodyte brain to consider scientific fact.\n\nI guess this means that Snoop Dogg probably shouldn\u2019t apply for that new opening as director of the FBI.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["war", "renew", "department", "rates", "prison", "emerges", "pdf", "mandatory", "middle", "prosecutors", "drug", "sessions", "jeff", "justice", "gollum", "drugs", "earth", "federal"], "polarity": 0.11483585858585858, "subjectivity": 0.5468569624819625},

You understand what I\u2019m saying?

Of course we did.\n\nOf course they did.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of that intentional decision, draconian anti-black drug policies have continued to both pathologize and criminalize black communities.

Communities where education is under attack, quality health care is scarce, employment doesn\u2019t provide a livable wage, and housing is often unaffordable and derelict are the communities most affected by drug policies meant to harm, not heal.\n\nThere is more danger in encountering a police officer while high on marijuana than there is contained in the drug itself. Once police are authorized to occupy poor and working-class black communities, suspicion of drug possession is often weaponized against its occupants. That alleged suspicion becomes just cause for police to gun down black people in the street, or in their cars, or in their homes; it becomes the reason that these extrajudicial killings are waved away by prosecutors and grand juries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts. Black and brown communities are blatantly targeted for broken-windows policing and surveillance. Despite the New York City Police Department\u2019s fraudulent claim otherwise, the department is one of the biggest perpetrators of these racist tactics.\n\n\n\nNow that opioid addiction is at epidemic levels and considered a crisis for white America, politicians have called for a \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs that protects white drug users (and sellers) while still criminalizing black users and sellers\u2014black sellers who often have been left no other choice to provide for their families.\n\n\n\nBlack mothers who have been harmed by the state over and over again, who then seek solace in drug use, are vilified, criminalized and abandoned. Susan Burton, whose son was killed when a Los Angeles police officer ran him over and kept driving, needed relief from her pain. And for nearly 20 years, she cycled in and out of jail on nonviolent drug charges, before ultimately creating A New Way of Life Reentry Project, which currently helps 32 women and about four children re-enter society with the support system they need.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women struggling with poverty and drug addiction have been targeted by police officers and raped. They are told that giving the state ownership of their bodies and their voices is the only way they can be free.\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not all.\n\n\n\nCivil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize money and property of those suspected of criminal activity\u2014even if there is no conviction\u2014disproportionately targets black people living in poverty. Once they are incarcerated, often after being arrested for low-level drug offenses, they are held hostage by a cash bail system that punishes people for their inability to pay their way out of jail. Be clear: These are modern-day debtor\u2019s prisons, which were outlawed in this country nearly 200 years ago and ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983\u2014unless, it seems, you\u2019re black and poor.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more egregious is the \u201cpay-to-stay\u201d scheme, which holds incarcerated people responsible for their room, board, clothing and medical treatment. Following release on either probation or parole, they are required for pay for their own supervision. The financial pressure that this often places on families is insurmountable, and the cycle continues.\n\n\n\nFurther, if someone is arrested on felony charges, they often lose their right to vote.\n\n\n\nAs the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Melissa Franqui notes, 1 in 13 black Americans of voting age is disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, a rate four times greater than that of nonblack people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s in America and in the United States that classifies you and declares you a citizen: that\u2019s your right to vote,\u201d said pastor Kenneth Glasgow, founder and president of the Ordinary People Society, a faith-based organization in Dothan, Ala., which fights for the re-enfranchisement of formerly incarcerated people.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo if I get a felony that takes away my right to vote, so that also takes away my citizenship,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cSo, what is this war on drugs really about?\u201d\n\n\n\nThis war on black, brown, indigenous, working-class and poor people is functioning exactly as intended. It turns bodies into profit margins, justice into collateral, and freedom into a privileged commodity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should almost be expected that many black people have internalized these anti-black, institutional assaults. Poverty in this capitalist nation is considered a moral failing, despite the reality that it has been constructed to sustain white supremacy by any means necessary. We have been told that the shame is ours, but the burden is imagined.\n\n\n\nIf I get a felony that takes away my right to vote, so that also takes away my citizenship. So, what is this war on drugs really about? \u2014Kenny Glasgow\n\nThis Black History Month, The Root and Drug Policy Alliance will disrupt the systems of harm and abuse that seek to dehumanize black people.

Nate Turner, Rev. Sojourner Truth, Rev. Harriet Tubman, Rev. William Barber and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d Carruthers said emphatically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is sacred work,\u201d Carruthers continued. \u201cOur work is righteous.\u201d\n\nDeborah Small, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University, brought the house down with her keynote speech, \u201cDrug Policy Is a Human Right.\u201d I\u2019ve written previously about the connection between slavery and the war on drugs, but Small brilliantly took it back to the very beginning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a country that built their economy promoting addiction for profit,\u201d Small said.\n\n\u201cTobacco, sugar, rum,\u201d those were the first drugs, and plantation owners were the dealers. Enslaved Africans were forced to build the supply.\n\n\u201cBeasts of burdens, that\u2019s why we were brought here,\u201d Small said. \u201cThere is something perverse about being brought here [for that purpose] and then having everything taken away by addiction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall also tackled rape as a foundation of slavery, and how that also fueled the drug war before it even had a name.\n\n\u201cWe were first forced to produce children we didn\u2019t want, and they took them and sold them to someone else,\u201d Small said. \u201cWhy as a community have we been willing to accept that for so many years?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpting not to shy away from how victimization and complicity can go hand in hand, Small used the John Ridley film 12 Years a Slave to paint the picture.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a scene where [Solomon Northup] was hanging by a thread. They couldn\u2019t lynch him. [Other enslaved Africans] eventually started walking around going about their business because they believed they couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Small said to the hushed crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s conditioning, a legacy of slavery.\u201d\n\nIn an interview leading up to the Not One Step Back strategy session, bandele said that holding the event in Georgia held special significance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe South has borne the brunt of mass incarceration,\u201d bandele said. \u201cDPA held a conference in Louisiana [the prison capital of the world] in 2007, and now we\u2019re coming back to the Deep South at a time when the U.S. attorney general is from Alabama. Black people are 32 percent of Georgia\u2019s population but 76 percent of those incarcerated for marijuana offenses. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\u201d\n\nMarc Lamont Hill moderated an important panel that took a deep dive into prison abolition and envisioning a nation beyond prisons and punishment. DPA\u2019s shift in strategy from focusing primarily on eradicating mass incarceration to encompassing the reverberating effects of mass criminalization of black, brown and poor people was a thread that was evident thoughout the session.\n\nClosing out the day was Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who was greeted with thunderous applause. Waters pulled no punches, charging the Los Angeles Police Department with living on drug kingpin Rick Ross\u2019 payroll during the height of the crack epidemic, and for occupying and entrapping black and brown youths simply because they could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were just smoking a little grass, drinking a little 40 oz.,\u201d Waters said to brittle laughter weighed down by the truth of it all. \u201cThey weren\u2019t bothering anybody.\u201d\n\nJust as important as the brilliant panels, the deep community ties that are necessary to sustain this work were strengthened and forged anew. Several organizers spoke about the daily stresses that come with the territory, the feelings of depletion and failure, as more black and brown people are gunned down by police officers who claimed they \u201cfit the description.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe all-encompassing rage as more mothers are arrested, their children thrown into the foster care system, can sometimes become too much. The hot tears that fall as more fathers are thrown behind bars, then thrust back into society without access to employment or housing, can make the strongest person feel weak.\n\n\n\nBut what is so special about this gathering is that those fathers were there speaking for themselves. Those mothers were there speaking for themselves. Those drug users who were stripped of their freedom were there speaking for themselves. There was no judgment, just love, and the ever-present belief that we will win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cALL OF US!\u201d shouted Dorsey Nunn at the conclusion of the weekend.\n\n\u201cOR NONE!\u201d shouted all of those gathered in response.\n\nAnd that revolutionary love is how we not only survive but thrive.\n\nThe Not One Step Back strategy session was sponsored by the Drug Policy Alliance, Georgia State University\u2019s Department of African American Studies, Morehouse School of Medicine, Amnesty International, the Ordinary People\u2019s Society, Self-Care Agency, SisterCARE Alliance, the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and Peachtree NORML.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDPA will be in Atlanta again Oct. 11-14 for the International Drug Policy Reform Conference.

Is it the color of red blood spilling onto concrete?

We delved into the numbers and reiterated that poverty, police and prisons are forms of structural violence that have been thrust upon black, brown and indigenous communities in the service of white supremacist patriarchal capitalism\u2014that the shame is not ours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no conspiracy that this nation, which holds itself in such high esteem, despite being the prison warden of the world, has conspired against the very communities that were forced to build it on their backs.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance reports:\n\nPeople of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal justice system and are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record. This is particularly the case for drug-law violations.\n\nNearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.\n\nResearch shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory-minimum sentence for black people than for white people charged with the same offense. Among people who received a mandatory-minimum sentence in 2011, 38 percent were Latino and 31 percent were black.\n\nBlack people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups. They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs. Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police-community interactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the color of pain is black, and it is neither fatalistic nor nihilistic to come to that conclusion. It is neither a diminishing nor rejection of black joy, black resilience or black futures to make that plain. From draconian drug policies to disenfranchisement, money-bail bond systems to civil-asset forfeiture, food and housing instability to police officers killing black people with impunity\u2014and preying on vulnerable black women simply because they can\u2014this system was designed to enslave black people and ration out freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, what does justice look like within a white supremacist police state that lies to itself about the depth of its own character? What freedom dreams can we conjure within a system created to criminalize, dehumanize and destroy us?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKassandra Frederique, New York state director at the Drug Policy Alliance, the visionary behind DPA\u2019s Black History Month series, and 2016 The Root 100 honoree, has consistently and unapologetically maintained that the history of the drug war in this country is inextricably linked to black history. She\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without acknowledging that the Nixon administration camouflaged its war on black people by causing hysteria around drugs, nor without acknowledging the Jim Crow era drug policies that continue to define Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without discussing mass incarceration, the disappearing of black men into the jaws of the criminal (in)justice system, the vilification of black mothers suffering through addiction, and the state-sponsored police slaying of black children.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore that the drug war has influenced everything from inhumane immigration policies to racist housing policies. We can\u2019t ignore that generational poverty has been equated to moral bankruptcy in this country; nor can we ignore that harm reduction for some working-class or poor black people is less about battling addiction, and more about navigating institutionalized, systemic anti-blackness. Grief, trauma, addiction, stigma, punishment: This is the cycle that must be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some black people, it is an act of self-perseverance to point to black people doing well by most metrics and say, \u201cLook, all of us aren\u2019t selling weed or living in the hood or in jail.\u201d And it is this line of classist, condescending thinking that led many black people to support tough-on-crime/tough-on-drugs legislation under both President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton without looking at the oppressive conditions that often lead to both. In this country, more than any other, violent drug policy has been carved out of black flesh.\n\nThe color of pain is black, but so is the color of freedom.\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique said. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledge.\n\nAtone.\n\nAct.\n\nThat is what Color of Pain\u2014a Drug Policy Alliance initiative spearheaded by Frederique and Dionna King, policy manager at the New York office of the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014is demanding: Reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Drug Policy Alliance\n\nThe Color of Pain website is an invaluable resource for us all.

In L.A. County, 40 percent of female inmates are Latino while 32 percent are Black. The men\u2019s facilities\u2019 population is currently 50% Latino and 30% Black\u2014over 80% people of color. While Black people make up less than 9% of L.A. County\u2019s population, they are almost a third of the county jail population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen they talk about building a jail, on the surface, they claim to be talking about beds\u2014mental-health beds, substance abuse beds, medical beds, high-security beds,\u201d Khan-Cullors, who is also a 2017 The Root 100 honoree, said in a statement to The Root.\n\n\u201cBut we know that those beds are intended to expand the carceral state by incarcerating more marginalized people for profit,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat is tradition in this country, and the numbers show that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is why Tuesday\u2019s action included placing beds in front of Los Angeles County\u2019s Hall of Administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe 100 replica beds we\u2019ve created are a far cry from the upwards of 6,000 beds that the L.A. County Board of Supervisors is trying to build,\u201d Khan-Cullors said. \u201cThis visual was a plea to divest from the $3.5 billion jail plan and invest in health care, youth centers, infrastructure, education, career development, and other resources that benefit our communities and address the years of governmental neglect and fundamental conditions that have caused deep-seated harm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Jayda Raspberry, organizing director at Dignity and Power Now, the demonstration was deeply personal.\n\n\u201cFor me, those beds represent torture, trauma, embarrassment, isolation, shame and death,\u201d said Raspberry, who was incarcerated at the California Institution for Women for six years. \u201cIt was such a brilliant action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose beds represented undocumented black and Latino people, as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cL.A. County leads the nation in deportations with over 35,000 since 2008 by allowing Immigration Customs Enforcement [ICE] access to the largest jail system on earth,\u201d Johnathan Perez, development coordinator at Immigrant Youth Coalition, told The Root. \u201cThat makes L.A. County jails the most common places for an immigration raid to take place.\u201d\n\nPerez continued: \u201cUndocumented people and legal permanent residents are, in effect, double punished; people who served their sentence and are ready to come home are instead met with a deportation officer. When we presented 100 jail beds, it signified a crossroads for this generation: Do we choose a path where we can build more jail beds than homes for the houseless, or do we choose to reimagine what our future looks like?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Khan-Cullors, divesting from systems and institutions that harm, and investing in communities, families and individuals most severely impacted in this white supremacist capitalist society, is critical. Despite what fiscal reports may say, if the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors fails to act accordingly, it will be admitting to moral bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that the Board of Supervisors should have a commission to study alternatives to jails,\u201d said Khan-Cullors. \u201cWith $3.5 billion, we could support people who are houseless and getting them homes. We could support children who have little access to getting healthy food.

Her appreciation for her newfound national status is contagious. In an MSNBC interview with Waters, Joy-Ann Reid talked about Waters\u2019 \u201cone-woman resistance to the normalization of Donald Trump,\u201d and it is a role that the congresswoman from California\u2019s 43rd District takes extremely seriously.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople in the coal-mine country who believed Trump, I want them to listen to who he is and what he\u2019s doing and how he lies every single day,\u201d Waters said to me as we sat across from each other Saturday afternoon in a conference room at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey need to evaluate who they\u2019re going to vote for in the next presidential election based on everything they\u2019ve learned about what they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Waters said between sips of hot tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dynamic congresswoman was there to keynote the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Not One Step Back strategy session, a community-building gathering not only to raise awareness about the war on drugs but also to hammer out ways to effectively fight Trump\u2019s regime\u2014which includes Confederacy and Ku Klux Klan sympathizer U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Of course, Sessions and his supporters angrily claim that he fought to take down the KKK, but observers at the time\u2014and common sense\u2014say otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Waters\u2019 resistance receipts go back so much further than this current administration.\n\nNo conversation about the political landscape of South Central Los Angeles is complete without talking about Maxine Moore Waters.\n\nThe most senior of the 12 black women currently serving in Congress and the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Waters was first elected to the California Assembly in 1976, where she served for 14 years. She was then elected to be the U.S. representative for California\u2019s 29th Congressional District (Jan. 3, 1991-Jan. 3, 1993) before being redistricted to the 35th District (Jan. 3, 1993-Jan. 3, 2013). She ultimately landed in the 43th District in 2013.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, Waters is an OG in the political arena, and her fierce resistance to white supremacy goes much deeper and broader than Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nIn 1986, after a brutal seven-year battle, it was Waters who successfully led the state of California in the divestment of $8.3 billion of the state\u2019s pension funds from any companies doing business in apartheid South Africa.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, as Los Angeles erupted with revolutionary rage after LAPD officers beat Rodney King and got away with it, white mainstream media and politicians called it a \u201criot.\u201d It was Waters who said that social and economic conditions stemming from injustice sparked the uprising: \u201c[Riots] sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable. So I call it a rebellion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1994, Waters was one of only 12 out of 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill, which, as I\u2019ve reported previously, was authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) and voted on by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt).\n\nAfter the San Jose Mercury News\u2019 Gary Webb exposed the clandestine connection between President Ronald Reagan, the CIA and Nicaragua\u2019s Contras\u2014and how that \u201cdark alliance\u201d funneled guns and drugs into L.A.\u2019s black and brown communities\u2014it was Waters and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who demanded a full federal investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether [the CIA] delivered the kilo of cocaine themselves or turned their back on it to let somebody else do it,\u201d Waters said in 1997. \u201cThey\u2019re guilty just the same.\u201d\n\n\n\nWebb was later found with two bullets through his brain\u2014an unlikely \u201csuicide\u201d\u2014but Waters\u2019 fight to expose and eradicate the war on drugs, which targets black and brown communities, continues to this day, as evidenced by her presence at the Drug Policy Alliance strategy session.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Republican leadership slipped through a bill to extradite freedom fighter Assata Shakur from Cuba, where she had sought political asylum\u2014and remains today. Waters mistakenly supported this bill because Shakur was listed not by her chosen name but by her former name, Joanne Chesimard. Once Waters realized this deception, she penned a letter to then-Cuban President Fidel Castro explaining what happened and clarifying her position:\n\n\n\nI oppose this measure is because I respect the right of Assata Shakur to seek political asylum. Assata Shakur has maintained that she was persecuted as a result of her political beliefs and political affiliations. [...] In a sad and shameful chapter of our history, during the 1960s and 1970s, many civil rights, Black Power and other politically active groups were secretly targeted by the FBI for prosecution based on their political beliefs. The groups and individuals targeted included Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, officials of the American Friends Service Committee, National Council of Churches and other civil rights, religious and peace movement leaders. However, the most vicious and reprehensible acts were taken against the leaders and organizations associated with the Black Power or Black Liberation Movement. Assata Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party, one of the leading groups associated with the Black Liberation Movement. The Black Panther Party was the primary target of U.S. domestic government political harassment and persecution during this era. This illegal, clandestine political persecution was wrong in 1973, and remains wrong today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome through, Auntie.\n\n\n\nWaters also opposed the Iraq War in 2009, when it was unpopular in some political circles to do so. With Waters\u2019 lengthy and consistent record of being on the right sight of history, despite all of the vitriol thrown in her direction, we began our wide-ranging conversation at the core: courage.\n\n\n\nThe Root: Congresswoman Waters, how do you sustain your courage, your conviction, in the face of so much rampant and perverse institutional violence? And when I say \u201cviolence,\u201d I\u2019m talking about the violence of silence, the violence of complicity, economic and systemic violence that says every single day that black lives do not matter?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine Waters: Well, you know, it\u2019s not something that I have to think about. I have 12 brothers and sisters. I came from St. Louis and I\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\n\nWhen I was little, we were on welfare at one point. Social workers would come to our home, and they were powerful. They could tell you what you could do, what you couldn\u2019t do; they would look in your refrigerator, look under the bed, all of that in the day. I thought at the time that I really wanted to be a social worker so that I could help people, because I saw exactly how they related to poor families. Later on in life, I learned that public policy was made by politicians. And I knew I wanted to be a part of the solution.\n\nTR: During the [Not One Step Back] \u201cStrength, Courage and Wisdom\u201d panel, Dr. Iva Carruthers, co-founder of the Samuel DeWiW Proctor Conference, said so powerfully that black mothers, particularly black mothers of sons, have to have courage each and every day. They have to have the courage to say, \u201cWe charge genocide.\u201d I agree, we must charge genocide, but I want to talk about what that means for our girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you have a son and a daughter. Sexual assault is the second-most-reported form of police brutality. Black women have to navigate not only white supremacy, capitalism and state violence but patriarchy and misogyny, and how all of these things intersect. How do we, as Tarana Burke, senior director of programs for Girls for Gender Equity, says, continue to \u201cring the alarm\u201d for our black girls?\n\nMW: Well, let me just move forward a little bit before I talk about that. I really do believe that black women are really emerging as leaders in this country. I feel it, and I feel it in ways that continue to be unveiled every day. There is an emergence of black girls in our colleges and universities. I see young black women lawyers, and how good I feel about that.\n\nMy message to black girls is, you are special and you are important. Love yourself for who you are, how you look and move on. Do not be influenced or undermined or disparaged by others who would say that you are not enough or not who they want you to be. Black girls are equally as deserving of protection as black boys, and we must do our best to support them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nTR: I know you were an assistant Head Start [a federally funded education program for low-income students] teacher in Watts in the 1960s during the Watts Rebellion. You\u2019ve said that you had mostly black teachers doing your formative years.\n\nMW: Yes, that\u2019s right.\n\nTR: So let\u2019s about the charter school experiment. I know the Democratic Party has had clashing views on that, leaning more toward supporting privatization under President Barack Obama, to now creating a more progressive education platform. Still, I wonder about this education experiment and how charter schools are framed as \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the parent\u2019s choice as it\u2019s white supremacy\u2019s choice. Which black children get to jump through these hoops to be grateful tokens? Who gets pushed out? How important is it to you now, during this heightened moment of state violence, that in many ways is reflective of the climate during the Watts Rebellion, to focus on reinvesting in public education?\n\n\n\nMW: I\u2019ve been worried about the privatization of education and charter schools for quite some time, and I\u2019ve watched what has happened with charter schools and how they have been promoted by certain people in this country. Charter schools and private schools tend to cherry-pick, and they pick kids that they think are going to be successful anyway. And they pick kids that they believe are not going to be so-called problems.\n\nTR: I also look at Mayor Rahm Emanuel closing schools in Chicago and betting on pre-K education with Goldman Sachs and their tricky social-impact bonds. New Orleans is disappearing black school-age children, and black teachers are undervalued and underpaid ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMW: Well, I don\u2019t trust Rahm Emanuel; that\u2019s the first thing.\n\nTR: Hello!\n\n\n\nMW: And he\u2019s a politician\u2019s politician who knows the game very well. He raises tremendous sums of money; he\u2019s connected not only through the [Hillary] Clinton campaign and Barack Obama\u2019s campaign, but also his brother out in Hollywood, with the entertainment industry. The kinds of decisions that I think he has made in Chicago are decisions that do not bode well absolutely for the school system and for African Americans and for those kids out there involved with guns. He believes he has real involvement in the black community with people he\u2019s never talked to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the things kids know, they know when you\u2019re afraid of them, and when you\u2019re real and when you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not afraid of them and you\u2019re willing to go, you can walk through any community and sit on any stoop. You get in a playground and just listen and just talk, and then be prepared to stand up for them at the right time. So this business of consolidating those schools, closing down schools, means Emanuel doesn\u2019t understand what communities are.\n\n\n\nTR: bell hooks taught us about the politics of location and the margins being a place of resistance. So I want to bring in the half of the country that didn\u2019t vote or voted third party. W.E.B. Du Bois said there are no two parties and only one evil exists. Malcolm X talked about the fox and the wolf. Angela Davis consistently teaches us that we need a new party. We see everything from the mass-incarceration boom under Bill Clinton to Obama\u2019s destabilization of Libya and the bombings in Yemen, Syria and Sudan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we have an entrenched regional caste system where black folks in the Deep South don\u2019t have access to health care despite the Affordable Care Act. What do you say to those people who do not trust Democrats or a system that isn\u2019t broken but is working exactly as intended?\n\nMW: I understand the distrust, and I also do not like the way the traditional party has worked in so many ways. When you look at how the Democratic Party is organized and you go to the state central meetings or the county, you know, it does not represent America. There\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\n\nWhat is it about politics that makes you think that you have to depend on others, the ones who have done it traditionally, to be able to change it or to make it what you want it to be? Another party is possible if [people] are willing to work for another party. And if millennials are willing to challenge the Democratic Party and they\u2019re willing to say we\u2019re going to have our own conventions, that is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: There is a lot of talk about identity politics and \u201cthe white working class,\u201d as if white people in poverty have not been and are not today capable of viciousness. Whiteness is the most toxic identity. There are people invested in sustaining white supremacy on both sides of the aisle. Trump is just the current representative. How do we have an American reckoning, a resistance that lives beyond and encompasses more than 45?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nMW: There are politicians, whether they\u2019re Democrats or Republicans, who have neglected their constituents in their neighborhoods. Still, we really do need to think seriously about how the result of that election is being analyzed and what people are saying about what happened, and all of that has been said about those who are dissatisfied with the Democratic Party. They\u2019re not talking about all the people who have fought in the civil rights movement for voting rights and civic participation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, if you\u2019re talking about small towns and you\u2019re talking about rural communities, most of those are represented by white men. What have these white men done for people in those small towns? What kind of public policy do they engage in on their behalf? I don\u2019t want us to see some big shift of where all of a sudden we\u2019ve done too much for [black people]; now we have to do something else, no. I hope those people who voted for Trump will come to their senses so that at 2018, they\u2019ll know better who to vote for at the local level and at the state level, and God willing, they will know that we need to get rid of him, out of office, now.\n\n\n\nAfter giving me a hug and chatting for a few minutes, Waters exited the conference room to go and give a 45-minute keynote address. She was met with thunderous applause. Afterward, she stood, in heels, for close to an hour shaking hands and taking pictures with young people who traveled to see their favorite auntie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Waters] is probably safe for another 10 years,\u201d Rob Stutzman, former communications director of California\u2019s Republican Party, said gleefully in 2002 as redistricting threatened to upend her base constituency.\n\nHe\u2014like so many others\u2014was wrong.\n\nIf one thing is clear, Maxine Waters is also a warrior, as most black aunties are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she\u2019s not going anywhere.", "keywords": ["maxine", "white", "party", "violence", "political", "oneonone", "theyre", "exclusive", "youre", "waters", "trump", "bigger", "know", "rep", "schools", "black"], "polarity": 0.04819279420343249, "subjectivity": 0.44555709066347393},

Under the new policy, if police find someone in possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana, officers issue a summons instead of making an arrest, so long as that person has identification and no outstanding warrants. Police are authorized to make arrests if marijuana is burning, if the type of possession indicates intent to sell, if the individual has an outstanding warrant, or if the individual is in a location meriting special consideration, like a school. As a result of this new policy, arrests for marijuana possession are down 37% \u2014 from almost 29,000 in 2013 to approximately 18,000 in 2016. This has translated into approximately 9,600 fewer arrests of Black and Latino New Yorkers for marijuana possession in 2016 as compared to 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office statement further reads in part:\n\nA report released last month by the Drug Policy Alliance \u2014 a group committed to legalization \u2014 ignores these changes and the resulting reductions in marijuana possession arrests of Black and Latino New Yorkers. The report ignores how this administration\u2019s approach to enforcement has resulted in both a safer city and fairer enforcement of state criminal law, which continues to prohibit recreational marijuana use. It also ignores the fact that New Yorkers makes tens of thousands of calls to 911 each year to complain about marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, even with marijuana-arrest rates down, the racial discrimination in those rates persists. Overwhelmingly, black and Latino residents are still being arrested at much higher rates than their white counterparts. As for those \u201ctens of thousands of calls to 911 each year to complain about marijuana,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office conveniently leaves out the gentrification of traditionally black and brown working-class and poor neighborhoods, which has coincided with an increase in calls to police.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office also conveniently leaves out that more arrests are made in black and brown neighborhoods in response to those calls, while in predominantly white neighborhoods, arrests are few and far between.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, we, the gullible public, are supposed to believe that white people don\u2019t smoke weed as much as black people, when all data points to the contrary. It is discrimination, period. The Root previously delved into those numbers:\n\nLast month, upon reading my article about the \u201cUnjust and Unconstitutional\u201d report, Peter Donald, the New York City Police Department\u2019s assistant commissioner for communication and public information, shot me a brief email, which read, \u201cI can see you did a nice job of trying to even spin the facts and data we sent your way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I\u2019m untangling the web of bullshit being spun by de Blasio and the NYPD. (Keep up, Donald.)\n\nDrug Policy Alliance New York State Director Kassandra Frederique is doing the same. Frederique released the following statement:\n\nMayor de Blasio is not disputing the data published in our report, he is trying to spin his poor record to look as though he has made some progress. In reality, New York City was the marijuana arrest capital of the world under Bloomberg and still holds that dubious title under de Blasio today. The 18,000 arrests in 2016 alone and outrageous racial disparities are a disgrace to the city and a blight on the mayor\u2019s record. The unjust and racially-targeted arrests are devastating Black and Latino communities across the city. The mayor\u2019s efforts to discredit the report and the Drug Policy Alliance by calling us legalizers, is a desperate attempt to distract the public from the facts of his abysmal record. Our report is based on data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. Rather than attack his critics, the mayor should attack the problem of racially-targeted arrests. For the record, the Drug Policy Alliance is committed to marijuana legalization to increase access for patients and end targeted policing in communities of color. And we\u2019re not alone; nearly 60 percent of Americans also support legalization. It\u2019s time for the mayor to get out of the spin cycle and back to work. Over the past two decades, more than 700,000 lives were irrevocably damaged by racially-targeted marijuana arrest policies. The mayor must end the biased policing practices that have ruined the lives of so many young Black and Latino New Yorkers now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever de Blasio and the \u201chenchpeople\u201d in blue want to spin this, he has not followed through with his campaign promises; the NYPD is not all of a sudden more humane and just; black and brown people are still violently targeted and living in occupied communities; and \u201cwhitey\u2019s on the moon.\u201d\n\nRead more at Medium.com.", "keywords": ["spin", "calls", "report", "record", "nyc", "blasio", "york", "city", "policy", "drug", "attempting", "mayor", "marijuana", "marijuanaarrests", "arrests", "mayors", "black"], "polarity": -0.03807573807573807, "subjectivity": 0.40421736671736663},

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.); author and political commentator Marc Lamont Hill; Black Lives Matter co-founder and organizer Patrisse Kahn Cullors; and some of the most committed activists, policymakers and community leaders in the country, this is a sleeves-rolled-up strategizing and planning session that makes the stakes clear and DPA\u2019s position plain:\n\n\n\nWe, as a country, those of us invested in freedom and liberation, equity and justice, cannot and will not take one step back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a declaration of determination, resistance and revolution.

Even if had been, anti-blackness is entrenched and intentional. Drugs are just the top layer, the proxy target. For this reason, we must be fiercely committed to dismantling systems of violence that relentlessly batter black, brown, and indigenous communities in the name of protecting them.\n\nBeloved author, activist and organizer asha bandele, who is also senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance, sat down with The Root to discuss DPA\u2019s Not One Step Back strategy session and the cumulative and pervasive scars deeply etched into black and brown communities by the perpetuators of the war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: The Drug Policy Alliance has consistently fought back against the violence, both structurally and physically, that has been inflicted on black and brown people across the country. So let\u2019s start with the very core of the so-called war on drugs. How did we get here?\n\n\n\nasha bandele: It\u2019s important to say not only what the drug war is but to place it into the right frame. The drug war, as it was initiated by then-President Richard Nixon in 1971, was the legal response to black resistance in the South during the Civil Rights Movement. At that moment, we were at the height of the moral mountain. Legal segregation had technically ended with the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and then Nixon put forward this set of policies that were supposed to be colorblind, right?\n\nBut they weren\u2019t. They were manufactured to go after black people; they manufactured the evidence about drugs and they manufactured the evidence about who the perpetrators were. Nobody wanted to see their kid high and endangering their lives, which is why so many black people bought into the idea of this drug war. Now, we know that white people use and sell drugs more than black people do. But black and brown people were the people who went to jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me about the significance of holding the Not One Step Back strategizing session in Atlanta.\n\nab: The South has borne the brunt of mass incarceration. DPA held a conference in Louisiana [the prison capital of the world] in 2007, and now we\u2019re coming back to the Deep South at a time when the U.S. attorney general is from Alabama. Black people are 32 percent of Georgia\u2019s population, but 76 percent of those incarcerated for marijuana offenses. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: The stigma attached to drug use leaches onto systems of oppression. Both are damaging to black and brown communities. There is a robust activist community in the South. It is where many of our ancestors are buried, and ground zero of the liberation struggle. But we\u2019re also talking about the Bible Belt, where there\u2019s still respectability politics. Some people are still ashamed of family members, sometimes even of themselves, because of drug addiction.\n\n\n\nThe fight for black and brown people to have autonomy over our bodies takes place right beside the critical need to recognize and dismantle systems of oppression strengthened by our trauma, including economic violence, that can lead to self-medication.\n\nab: That\u2019s exactly right; so when we\u2019re talking about African Americans, we\u2019re talking about a group of people who have lived under the stigma of simply being born. Just being born here, we were told that we were inferior and lazy. Now, the vulgarity of the drug war, with all the brainwashing it\u2019s done, is that it\u2019s convinced us to hate our own family and hate our own people. As long as we\u2019re talking about drugs, we don\u2019t have to talk about poverty. We don\u2019t have to talk about trauma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are struggling to maintain dignity within a white supremacist framework, but that dignity is maintained at the expense of those who are the most vulnerable. What we know for sure is that the use of drugs is not the final arbiter of whether or not a life is undone. If that were the case, then during the Wall Street era in the \u201980s and \u201990s, what happened to all those white boys who were using cocaine?\n\nTR: And that\u2019s so real. Drug use for some is a choice; for some it\u2019s an addiction. But this country\u2019s addiction to pathologizing and criminalizing blackness is the biggest addiction of all. It seems to be much easier for those in power or angling for power to address the symptoms and not the illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of the drug war, with all the brainwashing it\u2019s done, is that it\u2019s convinced us to hate our own family and hate our own people. As long as we\u2019re talking about drug abuse, we don\u2019t have to talk about poverty. We don\u2019t have to talk about trauma.\u201d\n\nab: Yes! People don\u2019t have access to healthy food; people still don\u2019t have clean water\u2014not just in Flint, Michigan, but across this country. That requires real structural change. Extreme poverty in the United States is defined as a family of four living on less than $13,000 a year. And in many ways, we actually still believe that this is a free country. We believe this even as so many of us suffer this way. We still believe it even as we watch people getting shot down by police officers who suffer no consequences.\n\nTR: This administration is following in the time-honored American tradition of ruthlessly dehumanizing black people. Has DPA had to change course in the wake of Trump\u2019s unexpected Electoral College win?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: Well, I think that, like most people, we thought that Hillary Clinton would win. We thought that we would continue working to end mass incarceration. Now, we find that we\u2019re going to have to defend and protect a lot of our victories. We don\u2019t want the Trump administration going into Colorado, or any of the other states where marijuana has been legalized, and start arresting people again. We don\u2019t want people being deported. All these issues are on the table with this administration, so we\u2019re going to have to play some defense.\n\nWhen they go low, we go hard. We don\u2019t give up ground. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\n\nTR: So many lives have been disrupted or ended. There has been so much pain and devastation. At the heart of this combat is the reality that black lives matter to us, holding fast to the vision that black lives must matter in policies and practices that shape this country going forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: That\u2019s exactly right. I buried my stepson. I don\u2019t want to watch another son, daughter, or child go in the ground for a ridiculous set of policies that we\u2019ve somehow accepted. We need to pull apart these dangerous myths about drugs and the drug war so that we can face them with courage and with character. We must determine who we need to be in this moment. We haven\u2019t tried treating everybody as human. It\u2019s time that we do.\n\nNot only is it time to declare that we\u2019re not taking one step back; this is a warning to those who continue to occupy our communities with hypermilitarized police forces weighed down with weapons and prejudice\u2014and backed by white supremacist policies and practices\u2014that it\u2019s in their best interest not to take one more step forward.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more about Not One Step Back here.", "keywords": ["white", "talking", "war", "step", "policy", "goes", "drug", "talks", "justice", "brown", "drugs", "hard", "incarceration", "country", "dont", "mass", "black"], "polarity": 0.09057836520434948, "subjectivity": 0.4553643294588175},

One set of laws for white people, one set of laws for people of color,\u201d Queens College professor Harry Levine, the author of the report, said in the Drug Policy Alliance press release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, de Blasio ran for mayor on a progressive platform, which included reducing the so-called war on drugs that has been used as an institutionalized weapon to decimate swaths of black and brown communities.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 10 of that year, he said the following:\n\nThere have been, in some cases, disastrous consequences for individuals and families. It hurts their chances to get a good job, to get housing. It hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan; it can literally follow them the rest of their lives. I think the fact that you will see fewer unnecessary arrests will be good for New York City as a whole. It will be good for New Yorkers of color and young people of color\u2014there is no question about that. We\u2019ll see how the numbers come out over time, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind it will be a very substantial impact. And for a lot of young people it means they will not have this reality holding them back; a summons is not going to affect their future. An arrest, could. And we want to avoid that unnecessary burden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cunnecessary burden\u201d has not been avoided; in fact, in the first three years of the de Blasio administration, the New York City Police Department made more than 60,000 criminal arrests for the lowest-level marijuana possession offense, according to the damning report.\n\nFurther, the NYPD has arrested black and Latino residents at astronomical rates. White people, per usual, prove that they have a monopoly on state-recognized freedom by presenting their \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d cards and skipping down boulevards lined with chalk outlining the bodies of our slain.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s New York was supposed to be cleansed and sanitized of the filth that was Rudolph Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, Ray Kelly, Bill Bratton and the state-sanctioned killers with badges they loved to protect and place on pedestals. Instead, de Blasio simply placed air freshener over the stench of decomposing dreams of justice while pointing to his brilliant, black feminist wife and accomplished children as proof that he was not like those other white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t already know, \u201cUnjust and Unconstitutional\u201d proves that de Blasio is merely a fox among wolves, skinning and grinning for the benefit of those who want to believe that neoliberalism is the answer to the blatant, Klan-ish tactics that have become par for the course for the Republican Party.\n\nKey findings from the report include the following:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 In the first three years of the de Blasio administration, the NYPD made over 60,000 criminal arrests for the lowest-level marijuana possession offense, an average of 20,000 marijuana arrests a year.\n\n\u00b7 The NYPD\u2019s marijuana arrests under de Blasio suffer from the same overwhelming racial disparities as under Bloomberg\u2014about 86 percent of the arrests for marijuana possession are of blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 As in previous years, in 2016 and in the first four months of 2017, 81 percent of the people arrested for marijuana were age 16 to 34, 58 percent were 16 to 25 and 27 percent were age 16 to 20. \u00b7 Residents of New York City\u2019s public housing developments constitute the single largest group of people arrested. In 2016, NYPD housing police made 21 percent of the city\u2019s total of 18,121 arrests for marijuana possession and 92 percent of those arrested were blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 Of New York City\u2019s 76 neighborhood police precincts, 37 neighborhoods have a majority of black and Latino residents. They have about half the city\u2019s population but provide 66 percent of the marijuana possession arrests and 92 percent of the people arrested are blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 Police in New York also target neighborhoods in midtown and lower Manhattan with active nightlife. Although pedestrians in those areas are predominately white, police arrest blacks and Latinos at very high rates. \u00b7 In 2016, in Greenwich Village, 69 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession were blacks and Latinos. In Chelsea, 77 percent were blacks and Latinos. In Soho-Tribeca-Wall Street, 73 percent were blacks and Latinos. In tourist-heavy Little Italy and Chinatown, 66 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession were blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 In 2016, police enforcement targeted people of color, especially blacks, everywhere in New York City. In Manhattan, blacks are 13 percent of the residents but 45 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession. In Queens, blacks are 18 percent of the residents but 49 percent of the people arrested for marijuana. And in Staten Island, blacks are 10 percent of the residents but 49 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession. \u00b7 The rates of NYPD arrests for marijuana possession per 100,000 of the population are extremely skewed. In Queens, police arrest blacks at seven times the rate of whites. In Manhattan, they arrest blacks at 10 times the rate of whites. And in Staten Island, the NYPD arrests blacks at 15 times the rate of whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s marijuana-arrest crusade has resulted in significant harms for those who are most vulnerable and has been used as a justification for the hyperpolicing of communities of color,\u201d said Kassandra Frederique, New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for the New York City marijuana arrests to continue at this level in 2017,\u201d Frederique continued. \u201cMayor de Blasio pledged to end biased policing practices\u2014if the end looks like more than 61,000 arrests on his watch and the same level of severe racial disparities, then the mayor has failed to carry out his campaign promises to black New Yorkers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin Finan, de Blasio\u2019s first-deputy press secretary, told The Root that marijuana arrests have dropped 37 percent since the start of de Blasio\u2019s administration and that that should count for something.\n\n\u201cThis administration has led a dramatic shift away from unnecessary arrests for low-level marijuana offenses in favor of summonses,\u201d Finan said. \u201cThe NYPD responds to quality-of-life offenses where and when they are observed, many of which are reported by members of the public.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, the drop in marijuana arrests coincides with now-retired U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin\u2019s ruling in 2013 that the police practice of stop and frisk was unconstitutional. The drop in arrests can easily be interpreted as a by-product of the legal end of the racially discriminatory and violent policy\u2014even if the policy still holds true in practice\u2014rather than anything that de Blasio has done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even with marijuana-arrest rates down, the racial discrimination in those rates persists, as the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Frederique notes. Overwhelmingly, black and Latino residents are still being arrested at much higher rates than their white counterparts.\n\nAccording to Peter Donald, the NYPD\u2019s assistant commissioner for communication and public information, however, it isn\u2019t that the NYPD is racist; it\u2019s that black and brown people commit more crimes and are more likely to call the police. The NYPD, God bless \u2019em, is just doing its job.\n\n\u201cWhere the department makes arrests for drug activity is nearly identical to where we receive drug complaints,\u201d Donald told The Root. \u201cThat is to say [that] those who call 911 or 311 and ask for a police response, get a police response. We respond to calls for service and help the community where they are demanding it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve included two heat maps below, one [on the right] which shows where the complaints are coming from,\u201d Donald continued, \u201cand the second [on the left], that shows where we make arrests [from 2014]. As you can see, they are nearly identical.\u201d\n\nNo, in fact, they aren\u2019t identical at all\u2014but they are extraordinarily revealing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cheat\u201d is hottest in predominantly black and Latino poor and working-class areas of the city, such as Harlem and the Bronx. It appears that for almost every complaint in those areas that Donald said the maps represent, an arrest was made.\n\nIt gets really interesting in Brooklyn, one of the most gentrified areas of the United States. Where neighborhoods where black and brown people are known to reside\u2014Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, East New York, Canarsie, et al.\u2014arrest rates are high and seem to correspond with the alleged calls made by neighborhood residents. In neighborhoods where white people are known to reside\u2014Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton, Bath Beach, et al.\u2014where calls also have allegedly been made by neighborhood residents, arrests did not follow.\n\nIt bears repeating that black and brown poor and working-class neighborhoods are becoming heavily gentrified; so it is questionable, at best, that it is black and brown people who are calling the police because people are outside smoking marijuana. More than likely, the increase in police calls is the result of gentrifiers doing the calling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, look at Staten Island (represented by the land mass in the top left of the maps): There are almost no low-level marijuana arrests in Staten Island, according to the above \u201cheat\u201d maps; the whiteness of it is glaring.\n\nDonald also made the argument that police \u201cproactively\u201d make arrests in neighborhoods where low-level crimes take place, but he didn\u2019t say why those neighborhoods were being hyperpoliced in the first place.\n\nWe know why, though. We\u2019ve always known.\n\n\u201cThe report says the \u2018Jim Crow era policies\u2019 and \u2018discriminatory marijuana arrests,\u2019\u201d Donald told The Root. \u201cThe Drug Policy Alliance report goes on to say \u2018strongly criticized the NYPD\u2019s racist marijuana possession arrests.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith what proof?\u201d Donald continued. \u201cHow do these statements stand up to your scrutiny?\u201d\n\nVery well, in fact. I\u2019m not sure what Donald hoped to accomplish by sharing these \u201cidentical\u201d maps, but he failed miserably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich leads us to conviction rates. As Politico reports:\n\n\n\nIn New York City in 2016, 15.8 percent of marijuana possession cases involving white people ended in conviction and sentencing, while 32.3 percent of the cases involving black people and and 30 percent of the cases involving Hispanic people ended in conviction. Over that time, 67.4 percent of cases involving white people resulted in ACD [adjournment in contemplation of dismissal], while 56.7 percent of cases involving black people and 59.2 percent of cases involving Hispanic people ended in ACD.\n\nThe discrimination evident in arrest and conviction rates persists despite marijuana use among black and white people being roughly equal. While de Blasio\u2019s office touted the \u201cdramatic shift\u201d to ACD to The Root, there was no acknowledgment of the racial disparities therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnjust and Unconditional\u201d further exposes why it is so critical that we discuss white power structures and not simply white privilege; that we expose discrimination and not simply point to disparities. This is an intentional occupation of black and brown communities; a continual profiteering from generational poverty inflicted by a white supremacist capitalist society.\n\n\n\nThis report is more evidence, as if any were needed, that slavery and, by extension, Jim Crow never ended\u2014it was simply redesigned by shape-shifters to avoid detection.\n\nSo-called liberal white men like de Blasio can be dangerous because they appear likable and nice, with warm smiles on their faces and the expectation of gratitude in their voices. Too many people falsely believe that that niceness and politeness is substantive and progressive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nAs \u201cUnjust and Unconditional\u201d\u2014and the flimsy defense and denial offered by de Blasio\u2019s office and the NYPD\u2014illuminates, numbers may not always tell the full story, but they don\u2019t lie.\n\nClick here to read \u201cUnjust and Unconstitutional: 60,000 Jim Crow Marijuana Arrests in Mayor de Blasio\u2019s New York.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "possession", "arrested", "report", "rates", "nyc", "finds", "higher", "york", "targeted", "jim", "blasio", "crow", "residents", "laws", "marijuana", "arrests", "whites", "blacks", "black"], "polarity": 0.03103192536429531, "subjectivity": 0.42639133698671255},

And when the time arrives for these hits to be carried out you\u2019re not going to see a C.I.A. agent with a suit and tie, and a badge that says C.I.A. walk up to someone, and pull the trigger. What they will do is to out-source to local police departments in the region of their target, and to employ those that look like the target of interest to infiltrate the workings in order to set up the environment for the eventual assassination (character, physical/incarceration, exile) to take place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI immediately thought of young Malcolm\u2019s words when, on July 6, 2016, Philando Castile was killed in broad daylight by St. Anthony, Minn., Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez. I thought of his words not because I believe that Castile was specifically the target of a CIA plot, but because the public assassination of black humanity\u2014and the character of black people\u2014has been an ongoing project in this white-settler colonial project that flag wavers call the greatest country on earth.\n\n\n\nThe way we look, the way we talk, the way we attempt to live free in a country founded on our violent oppression, have all been reasons successfully used to render us \u201ckillable\u201d in the eyes of society and to justify our state-sanctioned lynchings.\n\n\u201c ... the character assassination before the physical assassination; so one has to be made killable before the eyes of the public in order for their eventual murder to then be deemed justifiable.\u201d \u2014Malcolm Shabazz\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are born into this world with targets on our backs and often leave this world the same way. Castile had already been pulled over an estimated 46 times before Yanez claimed that the 32-year-old man\u2019s \u201cwide-set nose\u201d made him look like a criminal suspect. Further, he was a legal gun owner in a nation that weaponizes blackness and steals black lives but loves steel weapons.\n\nWhen Castile calmly and respectfully explained that he had a gun in the car, the trigger-happy Yanez \u201cfeared for his life\u201d because a black man with a gun has always been viewed as a clear and present danger. This nation assigns us to that category so that state-sanctioned executions will be deemed necessary. And for those scarce times when blackness alone does not give officers a license to kill, marijuana smoke conjures up the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports:\n\n\u201cI thought, I was gonna die,\u201d Officer Jeronimo Yanez told investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension fifteen hours after the shooting. \u201cAnd I thought if he\u2019s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girl was screaming.\u201d\n\nA wide-nosed black man in a car that allegedly smelled of marijuana had the audacity to carry a legal gun; that made him an enemy of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillable.\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs has been used to escalate a general sense that black people are beasts and that our communities are urban jungles,\u201d asha bandele, senior director of Drug Policy Alliance, told The Root.\n\n\u201cThroughout so many of these horrific police shootings, drugs have been used to justify the slaughter of innocents,\u201d bandele continued. \u201cWe saw it with Michael Brown, we saw it with Trayvon Martin, we saw it with shootings throughout the country, including that of Philando Castile. All you have to do is raise the specter of drugs, and supposedly no other question is supposed to be asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes when drugs are not the issue itself, the criminalization, the use of drugs, drug selling and drug use\u2014a criminalized feature in our nation\u2014is used to justify killing,\u201d bandele continued.\n\nKillable.\n\nBandele points out that the war on drugs is a living, breathing manifestation of the hatred this country holds for black people, and a cover for police hypermilitization and the occupation of black and brown communities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce you declare something a war, you got to declare someone an enemy,\u201d bandele told The Root. The drug war has been used as a justification for police killings of 92-year-old grandmothers in their homes, where all they had to say was, \u2018Oops, wrong house.\u2019 It\u2019s been used to justify the killings of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of war and the continuous war crimes that shape this war directly led to the lynching of Philando Castile,\u201d bandele said.\n\nBandele, like Malcolm Shabazz, was also clear that sometimes skinfolk are used to weed out members of the black community that some people find disposable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to understand how we contribute to deaths like Philando Castile\u2019s when we contribute to stigmatizing people, or determining who\u2019s a decent black person and who\u2019s not a decent black person,\u201d bandele said. \u201cWe may have, in progressive communities, a broader idea of who matters and who doesn\u2019t, but until we accept that every life has value and we see that in our communities, then we\u2019re almost participating in who they say they can kill, and who they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKillable.\n\nThis is why, bandele says, ending the war on drugs, dismantling white supremacy brick by brick and eradicating stigma is the necessary foundational work we need to engage in if we are ever to be free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we want to begin to roll back police militarization significantly, we have to work to end the drug war,\u201d bandele said. \u201cIf we want to disrupt a major tool that they can wield against us, in not only killing us, but them not being held accountable for killing us, we have to end the drug war. If we want to begin to disrupt extraordinary levels of black poverty, then we have to begin to end the drug war.\n\n\u201cIn doing that,\u201d bandele continued, \u201cwe will say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to spend money on over-incarceration or over-surveillance, or any of the other facets that make up mass criminalization. We\u2019re not going to have one more Philando Castile. Not on our watch.\u201d\n\nBandele gets to the root of the matter.\n\nBlack people have been shamed for financial poverty in a nation that is morally bankrupt; still, reparations for theft of our land, our labor and our lives is considered too much to ask for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are told that our lives come with white supremacist conditions.

And it is clear that the writers of WGN\u2019s Underground, the exceptional runaway hit show that tracks the movements on the Underground Railroad, have been, too.\n\n\n\nThere are spoilers here, so proceed at your own risk.\n\nOver the course of two seasons, viewers have been able to witness not just the larger struggle for freedom that enslaved black people fought\u2014and continue to fight\u2014but the more intimate struggle for identity, love and interpersonal relationships that took place behind the blood-soaked cotton walls of oppression.\n\nI have been riveted by Underground\u2019s treatment of sex and love. That black women and men still yearned for touch, for release, despite their chains is not something that is often discussed. Showing black bodies as erotic and beautiful and sensual while they\u2019re covered literally and figuratively with the scars of white supremacist violence is groundbreaking and necessary work. Read the article \u201cSearching for Climax: Black Erotic Lives in Slavery and Freedom,\u201d the brilliant work of Treva B. Lindsey and Jessica Marie Johnson, for more on this.\n\n\n\nWhile there is a clear trajectory from black bodies as erotic and vilified during slavery to black bodies being fetishized and criminalized now, it is the season 2 character arc of Ernestine, played by the incomparable Amirah Vann, that pushes \u201cthe underground\u201d squarely into the present as it collides with the war on drugs.\n\n\n\nErnestine has lost everything.\n\n\n\nHer son Sam has been hanged to pave the way for Tom Macon\u2019s political and racist ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacon, her rapist, master of the Macon Plantation in Georgia, is dead\u2014which is a loss of tenuous protection.\n\nJames, her son with Macon, has been forced out into the fields after enjoying the superficial privileges of being raised in \u201cthe Big House.\u201d\n\n\n\nRosalee, her daughter with Macon, ran away to freedom and is risking her life as an abolitionist under the tutelage of Harriet \u201cMoses\u201d Tubman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Ernestine, who played \u201cgood nigger\u201d for the sake of her children and herself, has been sold by Macon\u2019s viciously insecure and jealous wife to a South Carolina plantation. For the first time that we\u2019ve seen, Stine is in the field, thick scars on her back, suffering abuse from her new lover, Hicks, and fighting the urge to kill herself by breathing in\u2014and subsequently becoming addicted to\u2014laudanum, or \u201ctincture of opium.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the reality for many black women battling addiction and being criminalized for it today.\n\n\n\nIn a previous interview with The Root, Samuel K. Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014and I discussed this nuanced and painful reality in depth.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, Roberts is a pioneer in reframing the concept of harm reduction to encompass what harm reduction looks like for black people, and it focuses on much more than the ways in which society can make it safer for those addicted to drugs to seek help and rehabilitate. Harm reduction of color is focused on how critical it is to dismantle white supremacist systems of oppression that often lead black people\u2014black women specifically, in this context\u2014to self-medicate.\n\nRoberts said:\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s. Black women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a previous interview with The Root, Susan Burton\u2014founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project, a not-for-profit organization that currently helps 32 women re-enter society after incarceration equipped with the support system they need\u2014and I discussed the many ways that societal stigma around drug use and mental health, oppressive and violent conditions, and a criminal injustice system conspire to keep black women in a cycle of enslavement in which drugs often provide the only relief.\n\nBurton became addicted to crack cocaine in 1981 after a Los Angeles police officer ran over her 5-year-old son as he played outside their home and never looked back.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\u201cI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton continued:\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking. So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you see Ernestine?\n\nOnce Burton conquered her addiction, broke her chains, she dedicated her life to freeing other women from the same. Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, calls her Harriet Tubman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parallels between her story and Underground\u2019s second season, in which Harriet Tubman is played by Aisha Hinds, are clear.\n\n\n\nDuring this season, viewers watch black women fight against their chains, both visible and invisible. We watch Stine suffer through intimate partner violence, grieve the loss of her children and the loss of her identity. We watch her self-medicate in order to survive the genocidal system of slavery.\n\n\n\nWe watch her give up, walk into cleansing waters, weighted down by stone (which is a poignant metaphor for the weigh she carries), to find release\u2014only to be saved by a community of those who love her, who remind her that isolation is often a death sentence in and of itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is clear that every single conversation from this day forward about black women and the war on drugs should include Underground.\n\nIt is reminder that slavery has not ended; it has only shape-shifted. It is a reminder that the harm society causes\u2014the violence black women face, the systems designed to bury us beneath its foundation\u2014is the criminal, not us.\n\n\n\nIt is those systems that deserve our scorn, our rage and our judgment, not black women who self-medicate in order to survive it all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis season\u2019s Underground is a much-needed reminder that the shame has never been ours.", "keywords": ["war", "violence", "seasons", "judge", "underground", "woman", "women", "conversation", "pain", "system", "drugs", "master", "watch", "black"], "polarity": 0.03678967955827457, "subjectivity": 0.45862148641074263},

Hart also did not shy away from fiercely criticizing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, known for spearheading a deadly war on drugs in his country.\n\n\n\nDuterte became furious when reporters asked him about Hart\u2019s statements, calling Hart a \u201cfool\u201d and rejecting his research as nothing more than American \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Hart] said shabu does not damage the brain. That\u2019s why that son of a bitch who has gone crazy came here to make announcements,\u201d Duterte told Philstar. (\u201cShabu\u201d is a slang term used in Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to describe methamphetamine.)\n\nAgnes Callamard, the director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University and a United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, is an opponent of Duterte\u2019s drug war.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallamard, who also spoke during the policy forum, quoted one of Hart\u2019s points on Twitter. This resulted in Duterte slamming her as being in collusion with \u201cthat black guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should go [on] a honeymoon with that black guy, the American. I will pay for their travel,\u201d Duterte told reporters at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. \u201cThey should be together and discuss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his decadeslong research on drug addiction, Hart has openly discussed his experimentation with methamphetamine. He has also been unrelenting in cutting through stigmatizing rhetoric that has, in large part, fueled the war on drugs. He never wavers in pointing out the similarities between the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug Adderall and meth, as well as presenting evidence that cocaine and tobacco have similar effects on the fetus.\n\nTwo of the above substances are legal: Adderall, which is beloved by Big Pharma, and tobacco, which has been legally pushed in black and brown communities (pdf) for decades while discriminatory drug policies\u2014specifically around crack and marijuana\u2014have been used to terrorize and occupy those same communities.\n\nHart fearlessly pushes back against respectability politics and shame in black communities, demanding a shift in dialogue that includes human beings having autonomy over what they put into their own bodies; following the data on what is dangerous to consume and in what quantities; realizing that not all drug use is problematic; zeroing in on the drug war as an intentional and institutional war on the most vulnerable, oppressed and marginalized communities both domestic and abroad; and calling out state violence, specifically hypermilitarized policing, as more dangerous for black people than drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe most important conversation that I have with [my sons], in terms of drugs, is they are more likely to be arrested for drugs than their white friends,\u201d Hart said in conversation with asha bandele, senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance, during a Facebook Live chat on The Root.\n\n\u201cThe most potential negative impact or consequence is the police, not the drugs themselves,\u201d Hart continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s 2016 partner-gathering at Columbia University, Hart also urged attendees not to be distracted by the simplistic, media-driven narrative of a \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs.\n\n\u201cThey may be gentler on the [white] user, but black people are disproportionately arrested for the selling of opiates,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s comfortable to arrest black and brown bodies. Always pay attention to who\u2019s getting arrested.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is one thing that Hart always does, it\u2019s make it plain; being in the Philippines, of course, didn\u2019t change that.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Duterte signed an executive order in February authorizing the creation of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs.\n\nICAD consists of at least 21 state agencies, from \u201cpolice, military and coast guard to health, education and social welfare.\u201d Though the government claims that the purpose of the multipronged agency is to rehabilitate users and suppress dealers large and small, it has disproportionately targeted impoverished communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 8,000 people have been killed since the drugs crackdown started eight months ago, 2,555 of them in what police say were shootouts during raids. [ICAD] says that 48,000 drugs suspects were arrested,\u201d Reuters reports. Duterte has reportedly threatened to kill more.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nBe clear: From the U.S., to Mexico, to Honduras, to Ghana, to Thailand, to the Philippines, the war on drugs is global.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Democracy Now! interview, Hart talked about the death threats he received for unpacking the misleading rhetoric around shabu and for speaking out against Duterte\u2019s drug war in the Philippines.\n\nFrom Democracy Now!:\n\nWhen I was in the Philippines, the thing that I discovered is that it\u2019s a lot worse than I originally thought it was. Duterte operates in intimidation. And so, not only is he the problem, but there are other political officials who are afraid to speak out. They are the problem. And Duterte has taken a page out of the 1980s U.S. drug war in that he\u2019s using drugs to separate people, the issue of drugs to separate the poor people from the people who have means. And he is allowing or providing the environment so people could kill, as you pointed out, kill people who are engaged in drug use and in drug trafficking. And people are afraid to speak out against this wrong because Duterte has no qualms about having people\u2019s lives be threatened. In fact, I discovered that people are being killed for as little as $100. It ranges from about $100 to $500 to have someone killed. And so, actually, I left the Philippines early because my life was threatened because of me speaking out against what Duterte was saying about drugs and what he\u2019s doing. And so, we have it bad in the United States, but the Philippines, I have never seen anything like the Philippines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the entire interview below:\n\nPredictably, neither Donald Trump nor anyone in his regime has repudiated Duterte\u2019s vile statements about Hart, a U.S. citizen; nor has he voiced any concern about the death threats the acclaimed scientist has received.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Trump recently praised Duterte, gushed over their \u201cvery friendly\u201d conversations and invited him to the White House over vehement objections from human rights groups.\n\nGIven that Hart is equally vocal in his opposition to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 blatant push to escalate the drug war in the United States, Trump\u2019s silence should come as no surprise.\n\nTruth tellers such as Hart continue to put their lives on the line to end this inhumane war that has cost so many so much.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary SimplyPure. Next, we spoke with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr. about the history of the drug war and how it violently pierces black history in the United States. Here, we bring you the story of Susan Burton, founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, Susan Burton\u2019s 5-year-old son, her baby, ran into the street outside their home in South Los Angeles and was killed when a Los Angeles police officer struck him with his car.\n\n\n\nAnd he kept going.\n\n\u201cThe policeman never even stayed around,\u201d Burton, 64, told The Root. \u201cIt was almost like it was a hit-and-run. And all I knew is when I was sitting in the hospital, a whole army of police officers descended into the hospital.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey never ever ever even said, \u2018Ms. Burton, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Burton said, hurt and anger still evident in her voice. \u201cAnd that just added, you know, another layer of pain and feeling like ... like, worthless that these people didn\u2019t even acknowledge me.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton could not escape her grief, so she sought refuge in crack cocaine, the only relief she could find from an all-encompassing, debilitating pain that no mother should ever have to bear. And for nearly 20 years, she spiraled in addiction as she cycled in and out of prison on nonviolent drug charges.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, as Burton exited prison for the sixth time, a prison guard said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you back in a little while.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe would not return, but her road would not be easy.\n\n\n\nBurton could not find a job because of her criminal record. She could not access food stamps or housing assistance. Determined to stay drug-free despite the immense hardships she faced, she entered into a rehabilitation facility, and upon her release, a friend helped her find a job caring for an elderly woman.\n\n\n\nAnd a vision was born.\n\n\n\nBurton knew there were other women like her in need of assistance, love and support to navigate a world slowly killing them from the inside. So she began inviting women she knew who had been recently released from prison to stay at her home in South Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe transformed her home into a refuge, a warm place to heal and start over. In 2000 she incorporated her growing efforts into A New Way of Life Reentry Project, which currently assists 32 women and about four children re-enter society with the support system they need. Since 1998, the organization has helped more than 1,000 women discover a new way of life, serving about 60 women per year.\n\nBlack women, in particular, have to fight to be mothers in a white supremacist society we were not meant to survive free. We have to fight to raise our children in relative safety, to provide for them, to feed them and clothe them, to educate them, to love them in a society that threatens to snatch their lives away from us while we reach for them with desperate hands.\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when you compound these conditions with the carceral state and the drug war in which black women are primary targets, not simply adjacent to the criminalization of black men? What happens when we are pathologized as bad mothers, unstable mothers, unworthy mothers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens when our lives become fathomless pits of institutionalized cruelty, grief and despair, and drugs offer the only fleeting relief available?\n\n\u201cEvery time I was released, I swore I wasn\u2019t going back,\u201d said Burton in a 2010 CNN interview. \u201cBut I know now that without the resources and support, it\u2019s next to impossible. ... If you don\u2019t have a new door to walk through, the only thing is the old door.\u201d\n\nIn the conversation below, Burton talks about the stigma placed on black mothers, the institutional barriers black women face trying to access freedom for themselves and, if they have them, for their children, and how whiteness functions with deliberate cruelty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Addiction and poverty are symptoms of the malignancy of white supremacy, but society, especially when it comes to black women, never wants to treat the disease, it wants to criminalize the people suffering from it. Speak to those issues that black women face on an intimate level.\n\nSusan Burton: What I see overall is poverty in this country treated as a weakness and people who are impoverished are used by other people to enhance their wealth. For instance, in my community, there are places with payday loans on every corner. There is over-policing and excessive use of force and just excessive police presence and lack of services, trauma services, services to address violence. So everything is always met with a gun or handcuffs by law enforcement.\n\n\n\nAnd I mean, there\u2019s just better ways to address the poverty, which is a symptom of everything else. Poverty produces symptoms of other things like drug use and violence. People want to escape through drug use. And instead of treating and supporting people to divert them from drug use or understanding that this is their body\u2014and what they put in their body you should not be able to control it or demonize it or criminalize it\u2014they are punished. Punishment on top of suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I completely respect and understand that this may be difficult for you to discuss, and I don\u2019t want to place an emotional burden on you at all. So, if we can, I\u2019d like to talk about your son. You began to self-medicate, and that path led you into the criminal-justice system?\n\n\n\nSB: When I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center, and see, it was a policeman that killed my son. It was an LAPD detective that killed my son. I felt so angry and hurt that they never even acknowledged it, never even acknowledged me and what they took from me. My son.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking right now about reproductive justice. You had an LAPD officer take your son from you, steal your son\u2019s life from you, from him, and then you have them killing us, gunning down our children in the streets, and then you have them criminalizing parents in these conditions that this white supremacist society\u2014that hates women, hates blackness, hates poverty\u2014creates in the first place. And then you have police officers with a license to kill.\n\n\n\nSB: Yes, and then, speaking on reproductive justice, they are locking us up in our reproductive years. So many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal, what they\u2019re doing. And out here in California, 6 percent of the overall population is black women, but black women make up 29 percent of the prison population. It is genocidal.\n\n\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: From fiscal years 2005-06 to 2012-13, the state of California sterilized women without proper consent, a state audit found. At least 35 black women were sterilized during this time period, but the number is potentially much higher. Most of the women who were coerced into undergoing tubal ligation had low education levels and had been pregnant multiple times. California banned forced sterilization in 1979.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Also, the system is so quick to label black women as \u201cbad mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\nSB: Exactly. I have a woman here, Ingrid, who just got out of prison. She ran into the store to grab milk and Pampers for her baby, and came back out and got arrested for child endangerment. She was sent to prison for three years. Still in the midst, I believe that what she was suffering from was postpartum depression. The way black women with mental-health issues are treated in this country is just horrible.\n\n\n\nTR: Some years ago, I reported on a black mother, Frankea Dabbs, who was clearly suffering from mental illness after experiencing immense trauma in her life. She left her 10-month-old daughter on a subway platform and was instantly vilified. But we have white women who kill their children and empathy is widespread. And, according to a 2009 study conducted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health study:\n\n\n\nThe rates of mental-health problems are higher than average for black women because of psychological factors that result directly from their experience as black Americans. These experiences include racism, cultural alienation, and violence and sexual exploitation. ... African Americans in low-income, urban communities are at high risk for exposure to traumatic events, including having relatives murdered and their own experience with physical and sexual assaults, all of which are associated with the onset of post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: And that depression, that grief, often leads to drug abuse, right? And you know, those drugs just didn\u2019t pop up in our community. They were sent to our community. I\u2019m really clear that, that the amount of drugs that came into our community didn\u2019t come in there by our community members. You know, this was a deliberate tearing apart of our black community. And everything they\u2019ve done to us has been deliberate.\n\nWhen I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I\u2019m watching now, the opiate use by other folks and, all of a sudden, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, we have a health problem here.\u201d But with the cocaine use, we had a criminal problem. So I\u2019m watching that and saying, you know, this is what they do. This is what white folks do, you know, they criminalize black people, they offer support to other people. I\u2019ve watched the breaking down of our family structures through incarceration and separation and criminalization of our communities.\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because a woman is criminalized doesn\u2019t mean she is unfit or she\u2019s not a good mom. But I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nSo many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal what they\u2019re doing.\n\nTR: And that\u2019s another way the criminal injustice system robs black women of motherhood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\n\n\nTR: And that leverage is also used to assault black women, right? Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force, and women of color are more likely to be attacked. So, you look at someone like [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw, who targeted women like you, with prior charges. He targeted black women that he knew were vulnerable, black women (and one black girl) who were fearful of the criminal-justice system, and he raped them.\n\n\n\nSB: This goes on, and I know that you know that to law enforcement, black women are criminal. At every level, they abuse women, whether it\u2019s rape, you know, whether it\u2019s strip searches, whether it\u2019s dehumanizing them. I walk into a jail now to visit women, and the women are trained to turn from me and look at the wall. And I just want to cry for them. So all of these are forms of violence and dehumanization. All of them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You said something earlier about how society should not police what people put into their bodies, and that\u2019s such an important point. We talk about the shame and the stigma attached to what is put into our bodies. They will criminalize the body; they will shackle the body, and they will do all these things to control us, as opposed to looking at this system that really needs to be broken, because it\u2019s functioning exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. They won\u2019t address poverty, but they\u2019ll police those living in poverty. They won\u2019t address public schools that are intentionally allowed to fail in the service of privatization, but they will keep the school-to-prison pipeline running smoothly.\n\n\n\nSB: That\u2019s exactly it. It is a system that needs to be interrupted. When I, when my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that. I\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life. They hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\n\n\n\nI know that given my circumstances, there could have been services and trauma centers available to help me through such a difficult time, but there was not. So what I do now is free women up from that same system. If I can, I help them get their baby back; I do that. I take them to court. I write letters. I stand in front of that judge. I help them meet that court requirement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause what I know is, I can\u2019t get my baby back, but I can help another woman get hers. I can\u2019t take back the years, the time stolen from me, but I can stop another woman from giving all of her years. And that\u2019s what I do.\n\n", "keywords": ["susan", "freedom", "war", "liberator", "prison", "baby", "woman", "women", "drug", "burton", "system", "drugs", "son", "motherhood", "know", "black"], "polarity": -0.05518481947605659, "subjectivity": 0.43063863971080474},

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["approved", "teachers", "moving", "florida", "legislature", "forward", "dangerous", "armed", "school", "program", "children", "laws", "educators", "students", "especially", "gun", "schools", "black"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), 78, is small of stature but commands attention whenever she strides into a room. Her gaze is direct and inquisitive, with flashes of steely resolve serving as a clear reminder not to take her kindness for weakness.\n\n\n\n\u201cAuntie Maxine,\u201d the term of endearment that millennials have lovingly bestowed upon her, is amusingly accurate. You recognize this black woman because at some point in your life, you have been loved by a black woman who looks just like her. The black women who lovingly cleaned your scrapes and bruises, went to war on your behalf, but did not hesitate to get you all the way together when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaters is experiencing a season of political pop-culture relevance, and it is easy to tell that the veteran educator, community organizer and politician is loving every moment of it. Her appreciation for her newfound national status is contagious. In an MSNBC interview with Waters, Joy-Ann Reid talked about Waters\u2019 \u201cone-woman resistance to the normalization of Donald Trump,\u201d and it is a role that the congresswoman from California\u2019s 43rd District takes extremely seriously.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople in the coal-mine country who believed Trump, I want them to listen to who he is and what he\u2019s doing and how he lies every single day,\u201d Waters said to me as we sat across from each other Saturday afternoon in a conference room at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey need to evaluate who they\u2019re going to vote for in the next presidential election based on everything they\u2019ve learned about what they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Waters said between sips of hot tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dynamic congresswoman was there to keynote the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Not One Step Back strategy session, a community-building gathering not only to raise awareness about the war on drugs but also to hammer out ways to effectively fight Trump\u2019s regime\u2014which includes Confederacy and Ku Klux Klan sympathizer U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Of course, Sessions and his supporters angrily claim that he fought to take down the KKK, but observers at the time\u2014and common sense\u2014say otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Waters\u2019 resistance receipts go back so much further than this current administration.\n\nNo conversation about the political landscape of South Central Los Angeles is complete without talking about Maxine Moore Waters.\n\nThe most senior of the 12 black women currently serving in Congress and the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Waters was first elected to the California Assembly in 1976, where she served for 14 years. She was then elected to be the U.S. representative for California\u2019s 29th Congressional District (Jan. 3, 1991-Jan. 3, 1993) before being redistricted to the 35th District (Jan. 3, 1993-Jan. 3, 2013). She ultimately landed in the 43th District in 2013.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, Waters is an OG in the political arena, and her fierce resistance to white supremacy goes much deeper and broader than Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nIn 1986, after a brutal seven-year battle, it was Waters who successfully led the state of California in the divestment of $8.3 billion of the state\u2019s pension funds from any companies doing business in apartheid South Africa.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, as Los Angeles erupted with revolutionary rage after LAPD officers beat Rodney King and got away with it, white mainstream media and politicians called it a \u201criot.\u201d It was Waters who said that social and economic conditions stemming from injustice sparked the uprising: \u201c[Riots] sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable. So I call it a rebellion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1994, Waters was one of only 12 out of 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill, which, as I\u2019ve reported previously, was authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) and voted on by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt).\n\nAfter the San Jose Mercury News\u2019 Gary Webb exposed the clandestine connection between President Ronald Reagan, the CIA and Nicaragua\u2019s Contras\u2014and how that \u201cdark alliance\u201d funneled guns and drugs into L.A.\u2019s black and brown communities\u2014it was Waters and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who demanded a full federal investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether [the CIA] delivered the kilo of cocaine themselves or turned their back on it to let somebody else do it,\u201d Waters said in 1997. \u201cThey\u2019re guilty just the same.\u201d\n\n\n\nWebb was later found with two bullets through his brain\u2014an unlikely \u201csuicide\u201d\u2014but Waters\u2019 fight to expose and eradicate the war on drugs, which targets black and brown communities, continues to this day, as evidenced by her presence at the Drug Policy Alliance strategy session.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Republican leadership slipped through a bill to extradite freedom fighter Assata Shakur from Cuba, where she had sought political asylum\u2014and remains today. Waters mistakenly supported this bill because Shakur was listed not by her chosen name but by her former name, Joanne Chesimard. Once Waters realized this deception, she penned a letter to then-Cuban President Fidel Castro explaining what happened and clarifying her position:\n\n\n\nI oppose this measure is because I respect the right of Assata Shakur to seek political asylum. Assata Shakur has maintained that she was persecuted as a result of her political beliefs and political affiliations. [...] In a sad and shameful chapter of our history, during the 1960s and 1970s, many civil rights, Black Power and other politically active groups were secretly targeted by the FBI for prosecution based on their political beliefs. The groups and individuals targeted included Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, officials of the American Friends Service Committee, National Council of Churches and other civil rights, religious and peace movement leaders. However, the most vicious and reprehensible acts were taken against the leaders and organizations associated with the Black Power or Black Liberation Movement. Assata Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party, one of the leading groups associated with the Black Liberation Movement. The Black Panther Party was the primary target of U.S. domestic government political harassment and persecution during this era. This illegal, clandestine political persecution was wrong in 1973, and remains wrong today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome through, Auntie.\n\n\n\nWaters also opposed the Iraq War in 2009, when it was unpopular in some political circles to do so. With Waters\u2019 lengthy and consistent record of being on the right sight of history, despite all of the vitriol thrown in her direction, we began our wide-ranging conversation at the core: courage.\n\n\n\nThe Root: Congresswoman Waters, how do you sustain your courage, your conviction, in the face of so much rampant and perverse institutional violence? And when I say \u201cviolence,\u201d I\u2019m talking about the violence of silence, the violence of complicity, economic and systemic violence that says every single day that black lives do not matter?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine Waters: Well, you know, it\u2019s not something that I have to think about. I have 12 brothers and sisters. I came from St. Louis and I\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\n\nWhen I was little, we were on welfare at one point. Social workers would come to our home, and they were powerful. They could tell you what you could do, what you couldn\u2019t do; they would look in your refrigerator, look under the bed, all of that in the day. I thought at the time that I really wanted to be a social worker so that I could help people, because I saw exactly how they related to poor families. Later on in life, I learned that public policy was made by politicians. And I knew I wanted to be a part of the solution.\n\nTR: During the [Not One Step Back] \u201cStrength, Courage and Wisdom\u201d panel, Dr. Iva Carruthers, co-founder of the Samuel DeWiW Proctor Conference, said so powerfully that black mothers, particularly black mothers of sons, have to have courage each and every day. They have to have the courage to say, \u201cWe charge genocide.\u201d I agree, we must charge genocide, but I want to talk about what that means for our girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you have a son and a daughter. Sexual assault is the second-most-reported form of police brutality. Black women have to navigate not only white supremacy, capitalism and state violence but patriarchy and misogyny, and how all of these things intersect. How do we, as Tarana Burke, senior director of programs for Girls for Gender Equity, says, continue to \u201cring the alarm\u201d for our black girls?\n\nMW: Well, let me just move forward a little bit before I talk about that. I really do believe that black women are really emerging as leaders in this country. I feel it, and I feel it in ways that continue to be unveiled every day. There is an emergence of black girls in our colleges and universities. I see young black women lawyers, and how good I feel about that.\n\nMy message to black girls is, you are special and you are important. Love yourself for who you are, how you look and move on. Do not be influenced or undermined or disparaged by others who would say that you are not enough or not who they want you to be. Black girls are equally as deserving of protection as black boys, and we must do our best to support them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nTR: I know you were an assistant Head Start [a federally funded education program for low-income students] teacher in Watts in the 1960s during the Watts Rebellion. You\u2019ve said that you had mostly black teachers doing your formative years.\n\nMW: Yes, that\u2019s right.\n\nTR: So let\u2019s about the charter school experiment. I know the Democratic Party has had clashing views on that, leaning more toward supporting privatization under President Barack Obama, to now creating a more progressive education platform. Still, I wonder about this education experiment and how charter schools are framed as \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the parent\u2019s choice as it\u2019s white supremacy\u2019s choice. Which black children get to jump through these hoops to be grateful tokens? Who gets pushed out? How important is it to you now, during this heightened moment of state violence, that in many ways is reflective of the climate during the Watts Rebellion, to focus on reinvesting in public education?\n\n\n\nMW: I\u2019ve been worried about the privatization of education and charter schools for quite some time, and I\u2019ve watched what has happened with charter schools and how they have been promoted by certain people in this country. Charter schools and private schools tend to cherry-pick, and they pick kids that they think are going to be successful anyway. And they pick kids that they believe are not going to be so-called problems.\n\nTR: I also look at Mayor Rahm Emanuel closing schools in Chicago and betting on pre-K education with Goldman Sachs and their tricky social-impact bonds. New Orleans is disappearing black school-age children, and black teachers are undervalued and underpaid ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMW: Well, I don\u2019t trust Rahm Emanuel; that\u2019s the first thing.\n\nTR: Hello!\n\n\n\nMW: And he\u2019s a politician\u2019s politician who knows the game very well. He raises tremendous sums of money; he\u2019s connected not only through the [Hillary] Clinton campaign and Barack Obama\u2019s campaign, but also his brother out in Hollywood, with the entertainment industry. The kinds of decisions that I think he has made in Chicago are decisions that do not bode well absolutely for the school system and for African Americans and for those kids out there involved with guns. He believes he has real involvement in the black community with people he\u2019s never talked to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the things kids know, they know when you\u2019re afraid of them, and when you\u2019re real and when you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not afraid of them and you\u2019re willing to go, you can walk through any community and sit on any stoop. You get in a playground and just listen and just talk, and then be prepared to stand up for them at the right time. So this business of consolidating those schools, closing down schools, means Emanuel doesn\u2019t understand what communities are.\n\n\n\nTR: bell hooks taught us about the politics of location and the margins being a place of resistance. So I want to bring in the half of the country that didn\u2019t vote or voted third party. W.E.B. Du Bois said there are no two parties and only one evil exists. Malcolm X talked about the fox and the wolf. Angela Davis consistently teaches us that we need a new party. We see everything from the mass-incarceration boom under Bill Clinton to Obama\u2019s destabilization of Libya and the bombings in Yemen, Syria and Sudan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we have an entrenched regional caste system where black folks in the Deep South don\u2019t have access to health care despite the Affordable Care Act. What do you say to those people who do not trust Democrats or a system that isn\u2019t broken but is working exactly as intended?\n\nMW: I understand the distrust, and I also do not like the way the traditional party has worked in so many ways. When you look at how the Democratic Party is organized and you go to the state central meetings or the county, you know, it does not represent America. There\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\n\nWhat is it about politics that makes you think that you have to depend on others, the ones who have done it traditionally, to be able to change it or to make it what you want it to be? Another party is possible if [people] are willing to work for another party. And if millennials are willing to challenge the Democratic Party and they\u2019re willing to say we\u2019re going to have our own conventions, that is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: There is a lot of talk about identity politics and \u201cthe white working class,\u201d as if white people in poverty have not been and are not today capable of viciousness. Whiteness is the most toxic identity. There are people invested in sustaining white supremacy on both sides of the aisle. Trump is just the current representative. How do we have an American reckoning, a resistance that lives beyond and encompasses more than 45?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nMW: There are politicians, whether they\u2019re Democrats or Republicans, who have neglected their constituents in their neighborhoods. Still, we really do need to think seriously about how the result of that election is being analyzed and what people are saying about what happened, and all of that has been said about those who are dissatisfied with the Democratic Party. They\u2019re not talking about all the people who have fought in the civil rights movement for voting rights and civic participation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, if you\u2019re talking about small towns and you\u2019re talking about rural communities, most of those are represented by white men. What have these white men done for people in those small towns? What kind of public policy do they engage in on their behalf? I don\u2019t want us to see some big shift of where all of a sudden we\u2019ve done too much for [black people]; now we have to do something else, no.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. Here we speak with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to reduce the harm of white supremacy? How can we, as a society, look beyond drug abuse as an illness and reckon with anti-black oppression, punishment and capitalism as the cruelest addictions in this country?\n\n\n\nIn that context, white supremacy is the pusher, but black people aren\u2019t the ones with the habit.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014is an expert in the field of African-American and public health history and politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts is currently researching a book project on the history of drug-addiction policy and politics from the 1950s to the present, a period that encompasses the various heroin epidemics between the 1950s and the 1980s, therapeutic communities, radical recovery movements, methadone maintenance treatment and harm-reduction approaches.\n\n\n\nRoberts\u2019 focus on harm reduction for people of color encompasses much more than ensuring individual safety; rather, it is about dismantling systems that are unsafe for black people in the United States of America.\n\n\n\nIn our wide-ranging interview, Roberts and I discussed radical recovery; the critical need for \u201charm reduction of color\u201d to end the so-called war on drugs, which has always been a war against the most oppressed and has targeted black and brown communities; and why \u201cwhite flight\u201d is a misnomer that gives entirely too much credit to whiteness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Let\u2019s talk about the critical need for harm reduction of color. Because that specificity and intentionality, that reframing, is not something that is discussed enough.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr.: Yes, HROC, harm reduction of color, is a specific view. Harm-reduction-of-color critique in particular is concerned with structural inequality. So it recognizes the whole social issues of drugs and the political aspects of drugs as being bound up with structures that are in place, with the effect and the function of maintaining inequality for people of color and communities of color.\n\n\n\nFrom this view, we see that there\u2019s a connection between a failing education system, hypervigilant state security systems, the mass carceral state, and deindustrialization and lack of job opportunities. Those are all connected structurally in our harm-reduction-of-color critique. I emphasize harm reduction of color because there are harm-reduction organizations that are just about helping people stay safe as they use drugs, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But that\u2019s very different from what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a protest movement in many ways, or at least an advocacy movement that will ... do that seamless analysis of gender and sexual oppression, economic subjugation and mass incarceration, police brutality\u2014you know, the whole nine. HROC is a political analysis that draws from a decadeslong history of radical movements from the \u201960s and \u201970s and forward, but also drawn more immediately from the energy and analyses offered by the various movements, including the Movement for Black Lives.\n\n\n\nTR: Absolutely, and a large part of that is eradicating the racialized stigma attached to drug use. Not just the stigma, but also poverty, criminalization and addiction ... it\u2019s a lot to dismantle and to reckon with. And in the context of white supremacy, these are radical notions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. An HROC perspective recognizes that stigma actually has a function. That if you\u2019re gonna rationalize locking up 2 million people at any given point in time, as this country has, you have to have an ideology that convinces people that they\u2019re OK with that. So you need to have a series of stigmas about there being violent, predatorial, bad mothers; drains on the welfare state, cheats, you know, unwilling to work, animalistic\u2014all of those things, you know; potential or active terrorists. You need to have all of those in place if you\u2019re gonna get people to sign off on all that, because let\u2019s be clear: Putting together a carceral state is not easy.\n\n\n\nHas anyone been successful convincing the American public to put tens of billions of dollars behind the educational system? No. It\u2019s a lot to convince people to put in that kind of money. So you have to have them scared, and you have to have them thinking that the people against whom the stigmas are being mobilized are really not worthy of any sympathy or any respect, really.\n\nTR: What really stood out to me while reading over your synopsis of your book research was the term \u201cradical recovery.\u201d I\u2019m thinking here about mothers who may lose their job or the father who may have his children taken away. People stand to pay a steep price for speaking out about their addictions, and that can suppress recovery. Can you talk a little bit about the history of radical recovery in movement spaces?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Well, since the ... mid- to late \u201960s, we\u2019ve had a number of instances in which organizations have tied the issue of drugs, drug use, drug policy, to larger socioeconomic and political questions. So the radical part here is, we\u2019re not just talking about plain recovery. A lot of recovery programs are not political, and that\u2019s fine. In fact, some are actually very much, assertively anti-political. In most of your 12-step programs, you don\u2019t come in there talking politics, you know what I mean? Because for them, that detracts or distracts you from your own responsibility and problems.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s other organizations that were supported by the Black Panthers and the Young Lords. There was a group called White Lightning, which was an anti-racist, largely white organization. These organizations and other, smaller ones, made the connection between drug use in what was then called America\u2019s ghettos and later called inner cities, or center cities where jobs are basically fleeing. You know, we talk about white flight from neighborhoods, but it\u2019s not so much white flight that\u2019s a problem; it\u2019s capital flight.\n\n\n\nThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people. It\u2019s that all the money left, right? All the jobs left. At the same time, for a young, employable population, if one of the only games in town is the drug trade, well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Exactly, and that carried right on over into later decades.\n\n\n\nSKR: Right. In the \u201980s and \u201990s, you know, a number of things happened. First we get HIV ... by the early 1980s, heroin has taken such a toll in black communities\u2014not just heroin use itself, but also the police ramifications that many in our mainstream leadership pushed, the politics of respectability.\n\n\n\nThey basically washed their hands of people who used drugs, and they washed their hands of the issues, any issue besides law and order. And then you combine that with [Ronald] Reagan\u2019s war on drugs, which wasn\u2019t just about locking people up for using drugs; it actually ended up remaking governance itself. And what I mean by that is, imagine a period of time where the surest way you\u2019re gonna get grants from the federal government is to do drug interdiction. Not education, public health\u2014remember, Reagan was cutting down all those; not job training, not community development\u2014Reagan was slashing budgets for all that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one thing, if you needed anybody from the federal government to balance your municipal budget, you had to ... basically ask for drug money or drug fighting, drug-war money. So after a few decades of that, then if all you\u2019re carrying is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people.\u201d\n\nTR: Absolutely; the same held true for Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularization of John DiIulio Jr.\u2019s term \u201csuperpredator.\u201d Under Clinton, states began passing their own version of \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, and they were awarded Truth-in-Sentencing grants to build and expand prisons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. Clinton had the same enthusiasm for all those policies.\n\n\n\nTR: So let\u2019s talk about this country\u2019s commitment to punishment, capitalism and anti-blackness and how it has fueled the so-called drug war\u2014because we know it\u2019s really a war on the most targeted black and brown communities in the country. Now we have this \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs for white users, but it remains punishment for black people who sell drugs.\n\n\n\nSKR: So we do have to be careful here. Since 1973, with the Rockefeller drug laws, our impulse to separate drug users from so-called drug dealers is actually a pretty artificial one. Most people who use drugs at some point have sold drugs, even if mostly casually. And most people who sell drugs really are doing it just for side money and to support their own habit. So what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s very difficult to separate drug dealers from drug users.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of people who just use drugs and they never sold it. There are people out there who sell drugs and don\u2019t use. But with the majority, there is this overlap. The number of people that we would describe as \u201cking pins\u201d or major distributors is a pretty small number. So we have to be careful with separating the user from the seller, because all discretion is with the prosecution.\n\n\n\nTR: That\u2019s an excellent point. White drug use is primarily a public health issue, even though these white people also sell small quantities of drugs. Black drug sellers, even in small quantities, are hypercriminalized because our judicial system chooses to not see them as users. And if it does, there is stigma attached.\n\n\n\nSKR: And that\u2019s the danger of it, right? Because so much of it is in the eye of the beholder. At what point is somebody a user and at what point are they a dealer? If we decide as a society that we\u2019re going to take a public health approach to drug using, but continue to take a draconian approach to drug dealing, then we really haven\u2019t [done] as much reform as we\u2019ve thought. We can\u2019t demonize one and empathize with the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you have a white woman who has developed a heroin problem and on the side she\u2019s selling a little bit of heroin to maintain her own habit, somebody might say, \u201cOh, this poor woman; we need to get her a program because she\u2019s not really a dealer.\u201d You can take a black woman in the same case, but it\u2019ll conjure up all these myths of crack moms and black women are terrible mothers, and she gets the book thrown at her.\n\n\n\nHalf a measure of reform is not the full thing. For most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking here about [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw and how he targeted black women, specifically black women with criminal charges or who had battled some form of addiction and were afraid of being incarcerated. He used his power to do that. We could also look at women who are addicted to drugs and how some of them are not involved in sex work because it\u2019s something that they want to do, necessarily, but something that they need to do to survive.\n\nYou look at what [former Gov.] Mike Pence did in Indiana, stopping the needle-exchange programs and limiting women\u2019s access to reproductive choices, and how that affected women of color and exploded the HIV rate. There is a dangerous intersection of criminalization and misogyny, particularly as it pertains to black women. Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this is not only a public health issue for black women, or a criminal issue, but a feminist issue.\n\n\n\nSKR: Absolutely. There\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s.\n\n\n\nBlack women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Absolutely. Poverty is also a systemic illness that affects personal wellness in black and brown working-class communities and those living in deep poverty. And while there has been some movement on policy around the country, do you think there has been progress eradicating the intentional stigmas that fuel this oppression?\n\nSKR: Yes, one of the many inspiring things about the Movement for Black Lives is the high proportion of black women, queer and/or trans, in the leadership of these organizations. Because with them comes a very complex and sophisticated analysis of various problems and an ability to connect all those.\n\n\n\nSo if you want to talk to someone, if you want to get some of the most sophisticated analysis of sexual violence and sexual politics, drug policy, war on the poor and war on black people, you talk to a trans activist of color who works with homeless youth. Because they\u2019ve seen all of those things, and it can show how they all seamlessly work in this really hideous system that\u2019s essentially designed to brutalize entire populations. These are individuals that were not in the forefront of black political mobilization even 15 years ago, let alone 50 years ago, at the height of the civil rights movement. We are in a really creative movement in terms of black politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\u201d\n\nTR: There are a lot of tentacles deeply rooted in the history of black people in the United States that have been shaped by the so-called war on drugs. What does winning this war look like to you?\n\n\n\nSKR: Massive investment in education, obviously, right? But we also need to think about how we plan an economy where there are industries waiting for people who have that education. And that\u2019s gonna take a lot of political will as well. And we need to think about our health infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you started off our conversation, where you were saying poverty as a disease ... being poor is probably the most dangerous threat to your health. ... And so we ... need to really work on that infrastructure. Most of the issues that we attribute to drug use will be vastly mitigated if we paid more attention to these other things. When you give people more tools with which they can be in control of their lives, they tend to not be as harmful to themselves or to others. And, in this moment, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there.\n\n\n\nThe so-called war on drugs has been exposed for the capitalist money grab and the white supremacist assault that it is. And this I know to be true: It is our duty to win. We will not allow stigma to infest our communities, and we will continue to fight back when we see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will have greater empathy for those who make the decision to self-medicate the pain of struggling to survive in an anti-black society. And we will focus on radical recovery because the shame is not ours, and it never has been.\n\nWe will look at poverty as an illness and not a moral failing, and we will insist, to others and to ourselves, that our humanity in the face of intentional institutional violence and oppression is always worth fighting for.", "keywords": ["jr", "white", "radical", "war", "roberts", "flight", "scholar", "need", "policy", "drug", "women", "history", "recovery", "k", "drugs", "really", "samuel", "black"], "polarity": 0.045231531208974815, "subjectivity": 0.4546037713330948},

High School , some 91 miles northwest of Atlanta.\n\nThe incident unfolded around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday after some students attempted to get into Randal Davidson\u2019s classroom, but he refused to let them in, Dalton police spokesperson Bruce Frazier confirmed.\n\nThe students told the principal, who then came to the door and started to use his key to open it, however, Davidson forced the door closed on the principal. It was at that point that the principal heard a gunshot, sending terrified students scattering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had officers inside the building quickly,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nOfficers evacuated a hallway and secured the area. One student was hurt during the evacuation and had to be treated for an ankle injury.\n\nSome 30-45 minutes after the shot went off, law enforcement got Davidson to surrender, and he was taken into custody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had any dealings with him before,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nDavidson was well known as the longtime radio voice of Dalton High School football and basketball.

That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve. The state\u2019s Senate Appropriations Committee gave the nod to a similar bill later the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what if that armed teacher was in fact the aggressor instead of the savior?\n\nThe situation in Georgia could have ended a lot differently.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary SimplyPure. Next, we spoke with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr. about the history of the drug war and how it violently pierces black history in the United States. Here, we bring you the story of Susan Burton, founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, Susan Burton\u2019s 5-year-old son, her baby, ran into the street outside their home in South Los Angeles and was killed when a Los Angeles police officer struck him with his car.\n\n\n\nAnd he kept going.\n\n\u201cThe policeman never even stayed around,\u201d Burton, 64, told The Root. \u201cIt was almost like it was a hit-and-run. And all I knew is when I was sitting in the hospital, a whole army of police officers descended into the hospital.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey never ever ever even said, \u2018Ms. Burton, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Burton said, hurt and anger still evident in her voice. \u201cAnd that just added, you know, another layer of pain and feeling like ... like, worthless that these people didn\u2019t even acknowledge me.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton could not escape her grief, so she sought refuge in crack cocaine, the only relief she could find from an all-encompassing, debilitating pain that no mother should ever have to bear. And for nearly 20 years, she spiraled in addiction as she cycled in and out of prison on nonviolent drug charges.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, as Burton exited prison for the sixth time, a prison guard said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you back in a little while.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe would not return, but her road would not be easy.\n\n\n\nBurton could not find a job because of her criminal record. She could not access food stamps or housing assistance. Determined to stay drug-free despite the immense hardships she faced, she entered into a rehabilitation facility, and upon her release, a friend helped her find a job caring for an elderly woman.\n\n\n\nAnd a vision was born.\n\n\n\nBurton knew there were other women like her in need of assistance, love and support to navigate a world slowly killing them from the inside. So she began inviting women she knew who had been recently released from prison to stay at her home in South Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe transformed her home into a refuge, a warm place to heal and start over. In 2000 she incorporated her growing efforts into A New Way of Life Reentry Project, which currently assists 32 women and about four children re-enter society with the support system they need. Since 1998, the organization has helped more than 1,000 women discover a new way of life, serving about 60 women per year.\n\nBlack women, in particular, have to fight to be mothers in a white supremacist society we were not meant to survive free. We have to fight to raise our children in relative safety, to provide for them, to feed them and clothe them, to educate them, to love them in a society that threatens to snatch their lives away from us while we reach for them with desperate hands.\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when you compound these conditions with the carceral state and the drug war in which black women are primary targets, not simply adjacent to the criminalization of black men? What happens when we are pathologized as bad mothers, unstable mothers, unworthy mothers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens when our lives become fathomless pits of institutionalized cruelty, grief and despair, and drugs offer the only fleeting relief available?\n\n\u201cEvery time I was released, I swore I wasn\u2019t going back,\u201d said Burton in a 2010 CNN interview. \u201cBut I know now that without the resources and support, it\u2019s next to impossible. ... If you don\u2019t have a new door to walk through, the only thing is the old door.\u201d\n\nIn the conversation below, Burton talks about the stigma placed on black mothers, the institutional barriers black women face trying to access freedom for themselves and, if they have them, for their children, and how whiteness functions with deliberate cruelty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Addiction and poverty are symptoms of the malignancy of white supremacy, but society, especially when it comes to black women, never wants to treat the disease, it wants to criminalize the people suffering from it. Speak to those issues that black women face on an intimate level.\n\nSusan Burton: What I see overall is poverty in this country treated as a weakness and people who are impoverished are used by other people to enhance their wealth. For instance, in my community, there are places with payday loans on every corner. There is over-policing and excessive use of force and just excessive police presence and lack of services, trauma services, services to address violence. So everything is always met with a gun or handcuffs by law enforcement.\n\n\n\nAnd I mean, there\u2019s just better ways to address the poverty, which is a symptom of everything else. Poverty produces symptoms of other things like drug use and violence. People want to escape through drug use. And instead of treating and supporting people to divert them from drug use or understanding that this is their body\u2014and what they put in their body you should not be able to control it or demonize it or criminalize it\u2014they are punished. Punishment on top of suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I completely respect and understand that this may be difficult for you to discuss, and I don\u2019t want to place an emotional burden on you at all. So, if we can, I\u2019d like to talk about your son. You began to self-medicate, and that path led you into the criminal-justice system?\n\n\n\nSB: When I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center, and see, it was a policeman that killed my son. It was an LAPD detective that killed my son. I felt so angry and hurt that they never even acknowledged it, never even acknowledged me and what they took from me. My son.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking right now about reproductive justice. You had an LAPD officer take your son from you, steal your son\u2019s life from you, from him, and then you have them killing us, gunning down our children in the streets, and then you have them criminalizing parents in these conditions that this white supremacist society\u2014that hates women, hates blackness, hates poverty\u2014creates in the first place. And then you have police officers with a license to kill.\n\n\n\nSB: Yes, and then, speaking on reproductive justice, they are locking us up in our reproductive years. So many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal, what they\u2019re doing. And out here in California, 6 percent of the overall population is black women, but black women make up 29 percent of the prison population. It is genocidal.\n\n\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: From fiscal years 2005-06 to 2012-13, the state of California sterilized women without proper consent, a state audit found. At least 35 black women were sterilized during this time period, but the number is potentially much higher. Most of the women who were coerced into undergoing tubal ligation had low education levels and had been pregnant multiple times. California banned forced sterilization in 1979.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Also, the system is so quick to label black women as \u201cbad mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\nSB: Exactly. I have a woman here, Ingrid, who just got out of prison. She ran into the store to grab milk and Pampers for her baby, and came back out and got arrested for child endangerment. She was sent to prison for three years. Still in the midst, I believe that what she was suffering from was postpartum depression. The way black women with mental-health issues are treated in this country is just horrible.\n\n\n\nTR: Some years ago, I reported on a black mother, Frankea Dabbs, who was clearly suffering from mental illness after experiencing immense trauma in her life. She left her 10-month-old daughter on a subway platform and was instantly vilified. But we have white women who kill their children and empathy is widespread. And, according to a 2009 study conducted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health study:\n\n\n\nThe rates of mental-health problems are higher than average for black women because of psychological factors that result directly from their experience as black Americans. These experiences include racism, cultural alienation, and violence and sexual exploitation. ... African Americans in low-income, urban communities are at high risk for exposure to traumatic events, including having relatives murdered and their own experience with physical and sexual assaults, all of which are associated with the onset of post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: And that depression, that grief, often leads to drug abuse, right? And you know, those drugs just didn\u2019t pop up in our community. They were sent to our community. I\u2019m really clear that, that the amount of drugs that came into our community didn\u2019t come in there by our community members. You know, this was a deliberate tearing apart of our black community. And everything they\u2019ve done to us has been deliberate.\n\nWhen I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I\u2019m watching now, the opiate use by other folks and, all of a sudden, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, we have a health problem here.\u201d But with the cocaine use, we had a criminal problem. So I\u2019m watching that and saying, you know, this is what they do. This is what white folks do, you know, they criminalize black people, they offer support to other people. I\u2019ve watched the breaking down of our family structures through incarceration and separation and criminalization of our communities.\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because a woman is criminalized doesn\u2019t mean she is unfit or she\u2019s not a good mom. But I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nSo many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal what they\u2019re doing.\n\nTR: And that\u2019s another way the criminal injustice system robs black women of motherhood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\n\n\nTR: And that leverage is also used to assault black women, right? Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force, and women of color are more likely to be attacked. So, you look at someone like [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw, who targeted women like you, with prior charges. He targeted black women that he knew were vulnerable, black women (and one black girl) who were fearful of the criminal-justice system, and he raped them.\n\n\n\nSB: This goes on, and I know that you know that to law enforcement, black women are criminal. At every level, they abuse women, whether it\u2019s rape, you know, whether it\u2019s strip searches, whether it\u2019s dehumanizing them. I walk into a jail now to visit women, and the women are trained to turn from me and look at the wall. And I just want to cry for them. So all of these are forms of violence and dehumanization. All of them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You said something earlier about how society should not police what people put into their bodies, and that\u2019s such an important point. We talk about the shame and the stigma attached to what is put into our bodies. They will criminalize the body; they will shackle the body, and they will do all these things to control us, as opposed to looking at this system that really needs to be broken, because it\u2019s functioning exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. They won\u2019t address poverty, but they\u2019ll police those living in poverty. They won\u2019t address public schools that are intentionally allowed to fail in the service of privatization, but they will keep the school-to-prison pipeline running smoothly.\n\n\n\nSB: That\u2019s exactly it. It is a system that needs to be interrupted. When I, when my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that. I\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life. They hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\n\n\n\nI know that given my circumstances, there could have been services and trauma centers available to help me through such a difficult time, but there was not. So what I do now is free women up from that same system. If I can, I help them get their baby back; I do that. I take them to court. I write letters. I stand in front of that judge. I help them meet that court requirement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause what I know is, I can\u2019t get my baby back, but I can help another woman get hers. I can\u2019t take back the years, the time stolen from me, but I can stop another woman from giving all of her years. And that\u2019s what I do.\n\n", "keywords": ["susan", "freedom", "war", "liberator", "prison", "baby", "woman", "women", "drug", "burton", "system", "drugs", "son", "motherhood", "know", "black"], "polarity": -0.05518481947605659, "subjectivity": 0.43063863971080474},

That\u2019s what they call us; those are the lies they tell about us.\n\n\n\nThe war on drugs\u2014a war on the most vulnerable and targeted black and brown communities in the United States of America\u2014shapes black history just as much as it shapes our present struggle for liberation from a white supremacist capitalist state. One cannot discuss black history in its entirety without discussing the war on drugs\u2014and dismantling that war will shape our future.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 this truth led Kassandra Frederique\u2014New York State director for the Drug Policy Alliance, visionary and 2016 The Root 100 honoree\u2014to create a series dedicated to drug-policy reformers to place the urgent need for justice squarely in the Black History Month narrative.\n\n\n\nAt its conception, DPA\u2019s Black History Month series was the birth of awareness for Frederique, who has been at the forefront of the war against drugs since 2009.\n\n\n\nIn February 2012, New York City Police Officer Richard Haste gunned down 18-year-old Ramarley Graham in his grandmother\u2019s home after targeting him on the street. Haste alleged that Graham was selling marijuana and used that unsubstantiated allegation as a rationalization for his cold-blooded execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen traces of THC, the chemical found in marijuana, were discovered in Trayvon Martin\u2019s system during the autopsy of his body, racists used that fact to justify George Zimmerman profiling, stalking and ultimately killing him on that rainy night in Sanford, Fla.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew in that moment if we didn\u2019t connect the way the drug war was killing us, then we were complicit in disappearing their lives,\u201d Frederique says.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right. In 2015 the New York Times declared 1.5 million black men between the ages of 25 and 54 \u201cmissing.\u201d Because of early death and incarceration, there are 1.5 million more black women who are not behind bars than men in that age group. That disparity for whites is virtually nonexistent. One in every 13 black Americans has lost voting rights because of disenfranchisement laws. In 2014 the imprisonment rate for black American women was more than twice that of white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese oppressive conditions under an expanded police state can be traced directly to the so-called war on drugs, which is a systemic tool of enslavement. It has ravaged black and Latinx working-class communities, leaving white communities relatively unscathed. It has been positioned as a necessary response to crime and poverty when we know it to be a primary cause.\n\nFor Frederique, it has been critical to connect those dots for people who might not see the broader and deeper picture. And what better time than February?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black History Month project started out as an apology,\u201d Frederique tells The Root. \u201cFrom me to myself, to the future black drug-policy reformers that were on their way. I believed this narrative that what was happening to us\u2014incarceration, addiction, family destabilization\u2014was a result of us \u2018getting for what we asked for.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had always asked for a more definitive commitment from our movement on racial justice but I guess I always feared that they would throw back in my face that \u2018we did this,\u2019\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cI think back to my earlier years in this movement and wondered if I was assertive enough, if I asked all the questions that I needed to, did I study our movement hard enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow when I speak at forums, and attendees ask me what I think the role of black America was in the drug war, I reply, \u2018Yes, we wanted some of us to be locked up, but we also wanted treatment and we never got that part,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\n\n\nTroubled History\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, when Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill passed in 1994, it was with the help of 23 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were expecting a reinvestment in the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to that never happening, the bill was stripped of the Racial Justice Act, which would have allowed death row inmates to use data showing racial inequities in sentencing. The bill was also stripped of $3.3 billion\u2014two-thirds of it from prevention programs. A provision that would have made 16,000 low-level drug offenders eligible for early release was also removed.\n\n\u201cThey urinated on us and told us it was raining,\u201d Frederique says. \u201cBut I am not as gracious with our leaders of the past; Charlie Rangel\u2019s apology in [Ava DuVernay\u2019s documentary] 13th is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe threw away whole parts of our community, and we need to examine that as well, because that is our history. It just isn\u2019t all of it, and there is power in telling the full story,\u201d Frederique continues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederique also notes that it\u2019s important to recognize that drug-policy reform is not an industry of white saviors. It is so easy to believe otherwise, only because black pioneers have largely been erased from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we are meant to believe that benevolent white folks are how we got to where we are at now in our war against the war on drugs,\u201d she tells The Root.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, there are tons of brave white drug-policy reformers who forged paths for the drug war to end, like Ethan Nadelmann, Craig Reinarman and Ira Glasser, but they all read Troy Duster\u2019s book,\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cBeny Primm mentored Deborah Peterson Small. There was and is a resistance that has always been black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique adds. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nDrug policy is race policy. And to honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country.\n\n\n\nWe begin next week with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. James, the first black woman to own a cannabis dispensary, says that it\u2019s time for black America not only to look at the economic opportunities that the cannabis industry represents but also to do the necessary work of eradicating the stigma surrounding drug use: \u201cAll of the people that come to the dispensaries and all of the lawyers and all of the doctors and all of the elected officials that pretend like they don\u2019t know what weed is and they don\u2019t smoke cannabis need to come to the table and get real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get real.", "keywords": ["white", "war", "visionary", "narratives", "kassandra", "root", "policy", "history", "frederique", "drug", "series", "talks", "drugs", "owning", "drugpolicy", "month", "black"], "polarity": 0.04329440400868974, "subjectivity": 0.4161604268747125},

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount?

Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014is an expert in the field of African-American and public health history and politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts is currently researching a book project on the history of drug-addiction policy and politics from the 1950s to the present, a period that encompasses the various heroin epidemics between the 1950s and the 1980s, therapeutic communities, radical recovery movements, methadone maintenance treatment and harm-reduction approaches.\n\n\n\nRoberts\u2019 focus on harm reduction for people of color encompasses much more than ensuring individual safety; rather, it is about dismantling systems that are unsafe for black people in the United States of America.\n\n\n\nIn our wide-ranging interview, Roberts and I discussed radical recovery; the critical need for \u201charm reduction of color\u201d to end the so-called war on drugs, which has always been a war against the most oppressed and has targeted black and brown communities; and why \u201cwhite flight\u201d is a misnomer that gives entirely too much credit to whiteness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Let\u2019s talk about the critical need for harm reduction of color. Because that specificity and intentionality, that reframing, is not something that is discussed enough.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr.: Yes, HROC, harm reduction of color, is a specific view. Harm-reduction-of-color critique in particular is concerned with structural inequality. So it recognizes the whole social issues of drugs and the political aspects of drugs as being bound up with structures that are in place, with the effect and the function of maintaining inequality for people of color and communities of color.\n\n\n\nFrom this view, we see that there\u2019s a connection between a failing education system, hypervigilant state security systems, the mass carceral state, and deindustrialization and lack of job opportunities. Those are all connected structurally in our harm-reduction-of-color critique. I emphasize harm reduction of color because there are harm-reduction organizations that are just about helping people stay safe as they use drugs, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But that\u2019s very different from what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a protest movement in many ways, or at least an advocacy movement that will ... do that seamless analysis of gender and sexual oppression, economic subjugation and mass incarceration, police brutality\u2014you know, the whole nine. HROC is a political analysis that draws from a decadeslong history of radical movements from the \u201960s and \u201970s and forward, but also drawn more immediately from the energy and analyses offered by the various movements, including the Movement for Black Lives.\n\n\n\nTR: Absolutely, and a large part of that is eradicating the racialized stigma attached to drug use. Not just the stigma, but also poverty, criminalization and addiction ... it\u2019s a lot to dismantle and to reckon with. And in the context of white supremacy, these are radical notions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. An HROC perspective recognizes that stigma actually has a function. That if you\u2019re gonna rationalize locking up 2 million people at any given point in time, as this country has, you have to have an ideology that convinces people that they\u2019re OK with that. So you need to have a series of stigmas about there being violent, predatorial, bad mothers; drains on the welfare state, cheats, you know, unwilling to work, animalistic\u2014all of those things, you know; potential or active terrorists. You need to have all of those in place if you\u2019re gonna get people to sign off on all that, because let\u2019s be clear: Putting together a carceral state is not easy.\n\n\n\nHas anyone been successful convincing the American public to put tens of billions of dollars behind the educational system? No. It\u2019s a lot to convince people to put in that kind of money. So you have to have them scared, and you have to have them thinking that the people against whom the stigmas are being mobilized are really not worthy of any sympathy or any respect, really.\n\nTR: What really stood out to me while reading over your synopsis of your book research was the term \u201cradical recovery.\u201d I\u2019m thinking here about mothers who may lose their job or the father who may have his children taken away. People stand to pay a steep price for speaking out about their addictions, and that can suppress recovery. Can you talk a little bit about the history of radical recovery in movement spaces?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Well, since the ... mid- to late \u201960s, we\u2019ve had a number of instances in which organizations have tied the issue of drugs, drug use, drug policy, to larger socioeconomic and political questions. So the radical part here is, we\u2019re not just talking about plain recovery. A lot of recovery programs are not political, and that\u2019s fine. In fact, some are actually very much, assertively anti-political. In most of your 12-step programs, you don\u2019t come in there talking politics, you know what I mean? Because for them, that detracts or distracts you from your own responsibility and problems.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s other organizations that were supported by the Black Panthers and the Young Lords. There was a group called White Lightning, which was an anti-racist, largely white organization. These organizations and other, smaller ones, made the connection between drug use in what was then called America\u2019s ghettos and later called inner cities, or center cities where jobs are basically fleeing. You know, we talk about white flight from neighborhoods, but it\u2019s not so much white flight that\u2019s a problem; it\u2019s capital flight.\n\n\n\nThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people. It\u2019s that all the money left, right? All the jobs left. At the same time, for a young, employable population, if one of the only games in town is the drug trade, well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Exactly, and that carried right on over into later decades.\n\n\n\nSKR: Right. In the \u201980s and \u201990s, you know, a number of things happened. First we get HIV ... by the early 1980s, heroin has taken such a toll in black communities\u2014not just heroin use itself, but also the police ramifications that many in our mainstream leadership pushed, the politics of respectability.\n\n\n\nThey basically washed their hands of people who used drugs, and they washed their hands of the issues, any issue besides law and order. And then you combine that with [Ronald] Reagan\u2019s war on drugs, which wasn\u2019t just about locking people up for using drugs; it actually ended up remaking governance itself. And what I mean by that is, imagine a period of time where the surest way you\u2019re gonna get grants from the federal government is to do drug interdiction. Not education, public health\u2014remember, Reagan was cutting down all those; not job training, not community development\u2014Reagan was slashing budgets for all that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one thing, if you needed anybody from the federal government to balance your municipal budget, you had to ... basically ask for drug money or drug fighting, drug-war money. So after a few decades of that, then if all you\u2019re carrying is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people.\u201d\n\nTR: Absolutely; the same held true for Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularization of John DiIulio Jr.\u2019s term \u201csuperpredator.\u201d Under Clinton, states began passing their own version of \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, and they were awarded Truth-in-Sentencing grants to build and expand prisons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. Clinton had the same enthusiasm for all those policies.\n\n\n\nTR: So let\u2019s talk about this country\u2019s commitment to punishment, capitalism and anti-blackness and how it has fueled the so-called drug war\u2014because we know it\u2019s really a war on the most targeted black and brown communities in the country. Now we have this \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs for white users, but it remains punishment for black people who sell drugs.\n\n\n\nSKR: So we do have to be careful here. Since 1973, with the Rockefeller drug laws, our impulse to separate drug users from so-called drug dealers is actually a pretty artificial one. Most people who use drugs at some point have sold drugs, even if mostly casually. And most people who sell drugs really are doing it just for side money and to support their own habit. So what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s very difficult to separate drug dealers from drug users.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of people who just use drugs and they never sold it. There are people out there who sell drugs and don\u2019t use. But with the majority, there is this overlap. The number of people that we would describe as \u201cking pins\u201d or major distributors is a pretty small number. So we have to be careful with separating the user from the seller, because all discretion is with the prosecution.\n\n\n\nTR: That\u2019s an excellent point. White drug use is primarily a public health issue, even though these white people also sell small quantities of drugs. Black drug sellers, even in small quantities, are hypercriminalized because our judicial system chooses to not see them as users. And if it does, there is stigma attached.\n\n\n\nSKR: And that\u2019s the danger of it, right? Because so much of it is in the eye of the beholder. At what point is somebody a user and at what point are they a dealer? If we decide as a society that we\u2019re going to take a public health approach to drug using, but continue to take a draconian approach to drug dealing, then we really haven\u2019t [done] as much reform as we\u2019ve thought. We can\u2019t demonize one and empathize with the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you have a white woman who has developed a heroin problem and on the side she\u2019s selling a little bit of heroin to maintain her own habit, somebody might say, \u201cOh, this poor woman; we need to get her a program because she\u2019s not really a dealer.\u201d You can take a black woman in the same case, but it\u2019ll conjure up all these myths of crack moms and black women are terrible mothers, and she gets the book thrown at her.\n\n\n\nHalf a measure of reform is not the full thing. For most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking here about [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw and how he targeted black women, specifically black women with criminal charges or who had battled some form of addiction and were afraid of being incarcerated. He used his power to do that. We could also look at women who are addicted to drugs and how some of them are not involved in sex work because it\u2019s something that they want to do, necessarily, but something that they need to do to survive.\n\nYou look at what [former Gov.] Mike Pence did in Indiana, stopping the needle-exchange programs and limiting women\u2019s access to reproductive choices, and how that affected women of color and exploded the HIV rate. There is a dangerous intersection of criminalization and misogyny, particularly as it pertains to black women. Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this is not only a public health issue for black women, or a criminal issue, but a feminist issue.\n\n\n\nSKR: Absolutely. There\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s.\n\n\n\nBlack women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Absolutely. Poverty is also a systemic illness that affects personal wellness in black and brown working-class communities and those living in deep poverty. And while there has been some movement on policy around the country, do you think there has been progress eradicating the intentional stigmas that fuel this oppression?\n\nSKR: Yes, one of the many inspiring things about the Movement for Black Lives is the high proportion of black women, queer and/or trans, in the leadership of these organizations. Because with them comes a very complex and sophisticated analysis of various problems and an ability to connect all those.\n\n\n\nSo if you want to talk to someone, if you want to get some of the most sophisticated analysis of sexual violence and sexual politics, drug policy, war on the poor and war on black people, you talk to a trans activist of color who works with homeless youth. Because they\u2019ve seen all of those things, and it can show how they all seamlessly work in this really hideous system that\u2019s essentially designed to brutalize entire populations. These are individuals that were not in the forefront of black political mobilization even 15 years ago, let alone 50 years ago, at the height of the civil rights movement. We are in a really creative movement in terms of black politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\u201d\n\nTR: There are a lot of tentacles deeply rooted in the history of black people in the United States that have been shaped by the so-called war on drugs. What does winning this war look like to you?\n\n\n\nSKR: Massive investment in education, obviously, right? But we also need to think about how we plan an economy where there are industries waiting for people who have that education. And that\u2019s gonna take a lot of political will as well. And we need to think about our health infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you started off our conversation, where you were saying poverty as a disease ... being poor is probably the most dangerous threat to your health. ... And so we ... need to really work on that infrastructure. Most of the issues that we attribute to drug use will be vastly mitigated if we paid more attention to these other things. When you give people more tools with which they can be in control of their lives, they tend to not be as harmful to themselves or to others. And, in this moment, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there.\n\n\n\nThe so-called war on drugs has been exposed for the capitalist money grab and the white supremacist assault that it is. And this I know to be true: It is our duty to win. We will not allow stigma to infest our communities, and we will continue to fight back when we see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will have greater empathy for those who make the decision to self-medicate the pain of struggling to survive in an anti-black society. And we will focus on radical recovery because the shame is not ours, and it never has been.\n\nWe will look at poverty as an illness and not a moral failing, and we will insist, to others and to ourselves, that our humanity in the face of intentional institutional violence and oppression is always worth fighting for.", "keywords": ["jr", "white", "radical", "war", "roberts", "flight", "scholar", "need", "policy", "drug", "women", "history", "recovery", "k", "drugs", "really", "samuel", "black"], "polarity": 0.045231531208974815, "subjectivity": 0.4546037713330948},

Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger.

That\u2019s what they call us; those are the lies they tell about us.\n\n\n\nThe war on drugs\u2014a war on the most vulnerable and targeted black and brown communities in the United States of America\u2014shapes black history just as much as it shapes our present struggle for liberation from a white supremacist capitalist state. One cannot discuss black history in its entirety without discussing the war on drugs\u2014and dismantling that war will shape our future.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 this truth led Kassandra Frederique\u2014New York State director for the Drug Policy Alliance, visionary and 2016 The Root 100 honoree\u2014to create a series dedicated to drug-policy reformers to place the urgent need for justice squarely in the Black History Month narrative.\n\n\n\nAt its conception, DPA\u2019s Black History Month series was the birth of awareness for Frederique, who has been at the forefront of the war against drugs since 2009.\n\n\n\nIn February 2012, New York City Police Officer Richard Haste gunned down 18-year-old Ramarley Graham in his grandmother\u2019s home after targeting him on the street. Haste alleged that Graham was selling marijuana and used that unsubstantiated allegation as a rationalization for his cold-blooded execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen traces of THC, the chemical found in marijuana, were discovered in Trayvon Martin\u2019s system during the autopsy of his body, racists used that fact to justify George Zimmerman profiling, stalking and ultimately killing him on that rainy night in Sanford, Fla.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew in that moment if we didn\u2019t connect the way the drug war was killing us, then we were complicit in disappearing their lives,\u201d Frederique says.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right. In 2015 the New York Times declared 1.5 million black men between the ages of 25 and 54 \u201cmissing.\u201d Because of early death and incarceration, there are 1.5 million more black women who are not behind bars than men in that age group. That disparity for whites is virtually nonexistent. One in every 13 black Americans has lost voting rights because of disenfranchisement laws. In 2014 the imprisonment rate for black American women was more than twice that of white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese oppressive conditions under an expanded police state can be traced directly to the so-called war on drugs, which is a systemic tool of enslavement. It has ravaged black and Latinx working-class communities, leaving white communities relatively unscathed. It has been positioned as a necessary response to crime and poverty when we know it to be a primary cause.\n\nFor Frederique, it has been critical to connect those dots for people who might not see the broader and deeper picture. And what better time than February?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black History Month project started out as an apology,\u201d Frederique tells The Root. \u201cFrom me to myself, to the future black drug-policy reformers that were on their way. I believed this narrative that what was happening to us\u2014incarceration, addiction, family destabilization\u2014was a result of us \u2018getting for what we asked for.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had always asked for a more definitive commitment from our movement on racial justice but I guess I always feared that they would throw back in my face that \u2018we did this,\u2019\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cI think back to my earlier years in this movement and wondered if I was assertive enough, if I asked all the questions that I needed to, did I study our movement hard enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow when I speak at forums, and attendees ask me what I think the role of black America was in the drug war, I reply, \u2018Yes, we wanted some of us to be locked up, but we also wanted treatment and we never got that part,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\n\n\nTroubled History\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, when Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill passed in 1994, it was with the help of 23 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were expecting a reinvestment in the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to that never happening, the bill was stripped of the Racial Justice Act, which would have allowed death row inmates to use data showing racial inequities in sentencing. The bill was also stripped of $3.3 billion\u2014two-thirds of it from prevention programs. A provision that would have made 16,000 low-level drug offenders eligible for early release was also removed.\n\n\u201cThey urinated on us and told us it was raining,\u201d Frederique says. \u201cBut I am not as gracious with our leaders of the past; Charlie Rangel\u2019s apology in [Ava DuVernay\u2019s documentary] 13th is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe threw away whole parts of our community, and we need to examine that as well, because that is our history. It just isn\u2019t all of it, and there is power in telling the full story,\u201d Frederique continues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederique also notes that it\u2019s important to recognize that drug-policy reform is not an industry of white saviors. It is so easy to believe otherwise, only because black pioneers have largely been erased from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we are meant to believe that benevolent white folks are how we got to where we are at now in our war against the war on drugs,\u201d she tells The Root.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, there are tons of brave white drug-policy reformers who forged paths for the drug war to end, like Ethan Nadelmann, Craig Reinarman and Ira Glasser, but they all read Troy Duster\u2019s book,\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cBeny Primm mentored Deborah Peterson Small. There was and is a resistance that has always been black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique adds. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nDrug policy is race policy. And to honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country.\n\n\n\nWe begin next week with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. James, the first black woman to own a cannabis dispensary, says that it\u2019s time for black America not only to look at the economic opportunities that the cannabis industry represents but also to do the necessary work of eradicating the stigma surrounding drug use: \u201cAll of the people that come to the dispensaries and all of the lawyers and all of the doctors and all of the elected officials that pretend like they don\u2019t know what weed is and they don\u2019t smoke cannabis need to come to the table and get real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get real.", "keywords": ["white", "war", "visionary", "narratives", "kassandra", "root", "policy", "history", "frederique", "drug", "series", "talks", "drugs", "owning", "drugpolicy", "month", "black"], "polarity": 0.04329440400868974, "subjectivity": 0.4161604268747125},

I got her to try it pretty much on a whim, just from me seeing things on TV and different things like that, and people talking about the relief that it gives.\n\n\"It worked out for her better than I expected,\" Harrington continues. \"So, at that point, I started reading up even more on the plant and how it was helping so many people. Some people even credited black-oil cannabis with curing their cancer.\"\n\nAlthough Harrington had witnessed marijuana enrich his grandmother's life, it took a serious illness for him to experience the health benefits of the plant for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 2011 I was sending my grandmother cannabis that she needed just to give her relief, and the next year I ended up with a meniscus tear that led to a staph infection,\" Harrington says. \"When I had my fourth surgery, I was in Vail, Colo., and my cousin introduced me to cannabinoids, and from that point forward, I've never taken another Vicodin or anti-inflammatory pill.\n\n\"Whenever you say marijuana, I think everybody thinks of a blunt or a joint rolled up, someone sitting down smoking,\" Harrington continues. \"But because of the market, in some of these states, like Colorado, there are so many different ways that you can consume it. You can consume it through edibles. You can consume it through pill form, just like how pharmaceuticals do it. You have creams. It's important that people understand it and get that stigma off of marijuana.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat stigma, exacerbated and maintained by the so-called war on drugs, has led to detrimental and long-lasting effects on the most vulnerable and marginalized black and Latinx communities in the United States. Police departments are addicted to drug money, and the prison-industrial complex leeches onto black and brown bodies for its survival. As previously reported by The Root, blacks and Latinos are still being unfairly targeted and arrested on marijuana-related charges\u2014even though whites are more likely to sell drugs\u2014and many former felons are prohibited from participating in the nation\u2019s fastest-growing economy.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 64 has the potential to mitigate some of this damage. As the Drug Policy Alliance explains:\n\n\n\nRegulating marijuana through the smart policies of Prop. 64 will bring this booming and unregulated market under the rule of law to protect the most vulnerable in the state. Moving marijuana purchases into a system with strict packaging, labeling and advertising standards protects consumers and youth. Statewide regulations mandating environmental regulation, enforcement and restoration [protect] the state\u2019s natural resources. And reducing and eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana offenses [reduce] the detrimental impact of discriminatory criminalization. New tax revenue from the retail sales of marijuana, estimated to be up to one billion dollars each year, will be allocated to pay for the enforcement of the new law and will fund [substance-use] treatment for youth, environmental restoration, research on implementation and medical marijuana, local governments and [re-entry] programs in communities harmed by the war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the critical Nov. 8 vote looms closer, Harrington has become increasingly more vocal in his advocacy.\n\n\"On so many levels, the system just needs to be looked at and redone; marijuana is just one aspect,\" Harrington says. \"I've been in the marijuana-industry space for the last five years, and I've seen that it's a predominately white space. And minorities, we're the ones that are locked up behind it. And not only are we locked up, when we do get home, we have felonies and we can't even work, can't even get a job.\n\n\"So, once marijuana is decriminalized, a lot of things need to change, and the reason why I'm fighting for Prop. 64 is because decriminalization and legalization needs to happen first,\" Harrington continues. \"It's really sad that our little brothers and little sisters are locked up while people are making billions of dollars off of their backs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrington also believes that black and Latino communities should have the opportunity to participate in this growing, yet still racially discriminatory, economy.\n\n\"There should be something set up that they should have an opportunity to work in the space,\" he says. \"These are nonviolent, victimless crimes. Some of these kids were caught with less than an ounce of marijuana. It doesn't add up. Especially now that so much money is being generated. Let them come home and make a way for themselves and allow them to really change their lives for the better.\"\n\nFilmmaker and drug-policy advocate dream hampton, who directed and produced a video of Harrington sharing his story, agrees. As hampton tells The Root, \"I don\u2019t love everything about Prop. 64. I\u2019ll never love any contract with the state, and this proposal had to negotiate with and make concessions to law enforcement. But the most radical thing about Prop. 64, in my mind, is something I\u2019ve been publicly advocating for years\u2014and that\u2019s the economic-equity angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I made this video with Al because he's one of the biggest black entrepreneurs in the aboveground marijuana industry,\" hampton says. \"That's great for him, but we've been having conversations about how that can be good for more people. How ending the prohibition can both bring people home from jail and provide economic opportunity.\"\n\nClick here to view this theroottv.theroot.com embed.\n\nHarrington says that he plans to become a larger presence in the cannabis industry but is still weighing his options on what exactly his role will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm looking at different opportunities,\" he says. \"There are so many ways to be in the business without even touching the plant, but I do eventually want to cultivate and manufacture. And I'd like to be able to hire people that are coming home, who have been locked up because of this nonsense.\n\n\"Right now, though,\" Harrington continues, \"my focus is on raising awareness and telling my story, my grandmother's story, just so people can give marijuana an opportunity.\"\n\nAlso on The Root:\n\n\u201cGold Rush: Jay Z Takes an Unflinching Look at Racist, Violent War on Drugs in New Short Film\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2018Gentler War on Drugs\u2019 for Whites Is a \u2018Smack\u2019 in Black America\u2019s Face\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere Recreational Weed Is Legal, Should Those in Prison for Weed Crimes Get a Puff, Puff, Pass?\u201d", "keywords": ["war", "advocate", "black", "plant", "grandmother", "continues", "harrington", "64", "al", "prop", "locked", "drugpolicy", "healed", "ive", "marijuana", "nba", "veteran"], "polarity": 0.09213335890551083, "subjectivity": 0.480245949549747},

Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III (R-Ala.), President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general pick, conjures up as much anger and disgust as his Confederate name, but it\u2019s the increased power he now holds that makes him even more dangerous.\n\nThere is a reason 1,140 lawyers from around the country are protesting Trump\u2019s nomination of Sessions; there is a reason members of the NAACP were arrested for engaging in civil disobedience in Sessions\u2019 Alabama office Tuesday.\n\nThe former attorney general for Alabama is an unambiguously racist good ole boy with a long history of judicial violence against women and people of color\u2014black and Latinx people, specifically. Sessions is so racist, in fact, that although he was nominated in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan to be a judge for the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Alabama, his colleagues\u2014including then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, soon-to-be author of the destructive 1994 crime bill\u2014decided that he was unfit to serve on a federal bench.\n\nSarah Widman wrote in a 2002 piece for the New Republic:\n\n\n\nSenate Democrats tracked down a career justice department employee named J Gerald Hebert, who testified, albeit reluctantly, that in a conversation between the two men Sessions had labelled the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired\u201d. Hebert said Sessions had claimed these groups \u201cforced civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d In his confirmation hearings, Sessions sealed his own fate by saying such groups could be construed as \u201cun-American\u201d when \u201cthey involve themselves in promoting un-American positions\u201d in foreign policy. Hebert testified that the young lawyer tended to \u201cpop off\u201d on such topics regularly, noting that Sessions had called a white civil rights lawyer a \u201cdisgrace to his race\u201d for litigating voting rights cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is almost verbatim the language used in 1960 by the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission\u2014a violent white supremacist government organization that colluded with the Ku Klux Klan\u2014when director Albert Jones placed my grandfather, an NAACP member and voting-rights organizer, under surveillance for being a \u201csubversive\u201d danger to fine white citizens who were \u201cmolders of their heritage.\u201d\n\nSessions is a white supremacist, xenophobic bigot who once said that he believed the KKK to be an acceptable organization until he learned that they smoked marijuana. In 1985 Sessions, the then-39-year-old U.S. attorney for Alabama\u2019s Southern District, led a judicial lynching party against the \u201cMarion Three,\u201d claiming that Albert Turner, Spencer Hogue and Evelyn Turner were guilty of felony voter fraud for trying to help elderly black people vote. The Marion Three were eventually exonerated. Deval Patrick, former Massachusetts governor and former assistant U.S. attorney general, served as legal counsel for Hogue and recently wrote a letter (pdf) outlining why Sessions is unfit to be attorney general of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1995, Sessions supported the return of chain gangs to Alabama, men shackled together and working hard labor on the side of the road to purposely humiliate and dehumanize them. \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly proper,\u201d Sessions said at the time. Of course he would.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really just the tip of the Klan hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Prison Policy Initiative, white people in Sessions\u2019 home state of Alabama are underrepresented in incarcerated populations (62 percent, total population; 42 percent, incarcerated population); and black people in the state are overrepresented (26 percent, total population; 54 percent, incarcerated population). According to the Drug Policy Alliance, Alabama\u2019s total population is 68.5 percent white and 26.2 percent black; still, drug arrests are 63.4 percent white and 36.4 percent black.\n\nThis staggering racist discrimination is a microcosm of the rest of the United States\u2014and if Trump has his way, and this acquiescence to and complicity in placating white fragility holds, Sessions will bring the Confederacy to the U.S. attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written previously, the so-called war on drugs has always been a storefront operation created for the sole purpose of laundering the institutional, systemic and coordinated assaults on black and brown communities in the United States of America. And according to Sessions, he\u2019s been on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of efforts to occupy these communities and divide and destroy families by pushing for harsher sentencing, coercing testimony and convicting accused drug dealers on that testimony alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2002 he made a statement on the Senate floor explaining that the war was successful:\n\n\n\n[N]ational and local leadership sent an unambiguous message that drug use was morally, legally, medically and physiologically bad. There was no ambiguity. Second, Congress passed drug sentencing statutes that provided tough mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers. Third, the Department of Justice worked with local law enforcement to prosecute substantially more drug traffickers and send them away for long mandatory minimum sentences. This combination of a clear message, aggressive prosecution, and tough sentences for drug dealers helped drive drug use down. Our country benefitted from this. The War on Drugs was not lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDPA has turned with razor-sharp focus on Sessions to prevent him from causing even more damage. The organization has collaborated once again with dream hampton, the activist and award-winning filmmaker who produced From Prohibition to Gold Rush: History of the War on Drugs, and released a powerful video urging everyone to petition their senators to stop Sessions.\n\nLet there be no doubt: Sessions\u2019 moralizing about marijuana and disingenuous stance on reducing crack and cocaine disparities; his anti-immigration and anti-police oversight positions; his misogynistic stance on reproductive-justice issues and homo-antagonistic stance on LGBTQ issues; and his clear neo-Confederate politics make him a malignant cancer on anything resembling progress and equity in this country.\n\nThe policies he espouses are the reason former Oklahoma City Police Officer Daniel Holtzclaw felt comfortable targeting and raping black women on the streets he swore to serve and protect\u2014black women who were terrified of what the violent mass-criminalization system would do to them. They are the reason police officers feel comfortable carrying out street executions of black and brown men, women and children\u2014because they know they will face negligible consequences, if any at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPan-Africanist and Black Panther leader Kwame Ture, formerly Stokely Carmichael, once said: \u201cIf a white man wants to lynch me, that\u2019s his problem.

But I think there is no one solution for creating safety.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or his students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it is an idea that needs to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish she had said: \u201cSeriously, this might be the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard from my father, and I went to Trump University for a semester. OK, I didn\u2019t go there, I mean, hell, I was smart enough to know not to go there, but I don\u2019t know how he makes this shit up! Also, did you know he has another daughter named Tiffany, but no one ever talks about her?! You, want to know why? Because I\u2019m the dominant Trump offspring!

I got her to try it pretty much on a whim, just from me seeing things on TV and different things like that, and people talking about the relief that it gives.\n\n\"It worked out for her better than I expected,\" Harrington continues. \"So, at that point, I started reading up even more on the plant and how it was helping so many people. Some people even credited black-oil cannabis with curing their cancer.\"\n\nAlthough Harrington had witnessed marijuana enrich his grandmother's life, it took a serious illness for him to experience the health benefits of the plant for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 2011 I was sending my grandmother cannabis that she needed just to give her relief, and the next year I ended up with a meniscus tear that led to a staph infection,\" Harrington says. \"When I had my fourth surgery, I was in Vail, Colo., and my cousin introduced me to cannabinoids, and from that point forward, I've never taken another Vicodin or anti-inflammatory pill.\n\n\"Whenever you say marijuana, I think everybody thinks of a blunt or a joint rolled up, someone sitting down smoking,\" Harrington continues. \"But because of the market, in some of these states, like Colorado, there are so many different ways that you can consume it. You can consume it through edibles. You can consume it through pill form, just like how pharmaceuticals do it. You have creams. It's important that people understand it and get that stigma off of marijuana.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat stigma, exacerbated and maintained by the so-called war on drugs, has led to detrimental and long-lasting effects on the most vulnerable and marginalized black and Latinx communities in the United States. Police departments are addicted to drug money, and the prison-industrial complex leeches onto black and brown bodies for its survival. As previously reported by The Root, blacks and Latinos are still being unfairly targeted and arrested on marijuana-related charges\u2014even though whites are more likely to sell drugs\u2014and many former felons are prohibited from participating in the nation\u2019s fastest-growing economy.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 64 has the potential to mitigate some of this damage. As the Drug Policy Alliance explains:\n\n\n\nRegulating marijuana through the smart policies of Prop. 64 will bring this booming and unregulated market under the rule of law to protect the most vulnerable in the state. Moving marijuana purchases into a system with strict packaging, labeling and advertising standards protects consumers and youth. Statewide regulations mandating environmental regulation, enforcement and restoration [protect] the state\u2019s natural resources. And reducing and eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana offenses [reduce] the detrimental impact of discriminatory criminalization. New tax revenue from the retail sales of marijuana, estimated to be up to one billion dollars each year, will be allocated to pay for the enforcement of the new law and will fund [substance-use] treatment for youth, environmental restoration, research on implementation and medical marijuana, local governments and [re-entry] programs in communities harmed by the war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the critical Nov. 8 vote looms closer, Harrington has become increasingly more vocal in his advocacy.\n\n\"On so many levels, the system just needs to be looked at and redone; marijuana is just one aspect,\" Harrington says. \"I've been in the marijuana-industry space for the last five years, and I've seen that it's a predominately white space. And minorities, we're the ones that are locked up behind it. And not only are we locked up, when we do get home, we have felonies and we can't even work, can't even get a job.\n\n\"So, once marijuana is decriminalized, a lot of things need to change, and the reason why I'm fighting for Prop. 64 is because decriminalization and legalization needs to happen first,\" Harrington continues. \"It's really sad that our little brothers and little sisters are locked up while people are making billions of dollars off of their backs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrington also believes that black and Latino communities should have the opportunity to participate in this growing, yet still racially discriminatory, economy.\n\n\"There should be something set up that they should have an opportunity to work in the space,\" he says. \"These are nonviolent, victimless crimes. Some of these kids were caught with less than an ounce of marijuana. It doesn't add up. Especially now that so much money is being generated. Let them come home and make a way for themselves and allow them to really change their lives for the better.\"\n\nFilmmaker and drug-policy advocate dream hampton, who directed and produced a video of Harrington sharing his story, agrees. As hampton tells The Root, \"I don\u2019t love everything about Prop. 64. I\u2019ll never love any contract with the state, and this proposal had to negotiate with and make concessions to law enforcement. But the most radical thing about Prop. 64, in my mind, is something I\u2019ve been publicly advocating for years\u2014and that\u2019s the economic-equity angle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I made this video with Al because he's one of the biggest black entrepreneurs in the aboveground marijuana industry,\" hampton says. \"That's great for him, but we've been having conversations about how that can be good for more people. How ending the prohibition can both bring people home from jail and provide economic opportunity.\"\n\nClick here to view this theroottv.theroot.com embed.\n\nHarrington says that he plans to become a larger presence in the cannabis industry but is still weighing his options on what exactly his role will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm looking at different opportunities,\" he says. \"There are so many ways to be in the business without even touching the plant, but I do eventually want to cultivate and manufacture. And I'd like to be able to hire people that are coming home, who have been locked up because of this nonsense.\n\n\"Right now, though,\" Harrington continues, \"my focus is on raising awareness and telling my story, my grandmother's story, just so people can give marijuana an opportunity.\"\n\nAlso on The Root:\n\n\u201cGold Rush: Jay Z Takes an Unflinching Look at Racist, Violent War on Drugs in New Short Film\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2018Gentler War on Drugs\u2019 for Whites Is a \u2018Smack\u2019 in Black America\u2019s Face\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere Recreational Weed Is Legal, Should Those in Prison for Weed Crimes Get a Puff, Puff, Pass?\u201d", "keywords": ["war", "advocate", "black", "plant", "grandmother", "continues", "harrington", "64", "al", "prop", "locked", "drugpolicy", "healed", "ive", "marijuana", "nba", "veteran"], "polarity": 0.09213335890551083, "subjectivity": 0.480245949549747},

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["shouldnt", "florida", "enforcement", "proposed", "ranks", "gov", "law", "school", "yes", "mental", "trump", "rick", "nra", "weapons", "scott", "health", "gun", "celebrate"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["guns", "white", "war", "believe", "members", "theres", "black", "money", "nras", "control", "stop", "theory", "ownership", "right", "nra", "kids", "buy", "gun", "wont"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins?

The optics are especially bad given that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used his legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle to gun down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cA White House photographer confirmed to CBS News that there are photos of the bill signing.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["remember", "president", "white", "notes", "teacher", "teachers", "victims", "care", "violent", "school", "trump", "going", "house", "check", "listening", "massshooting"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

Carson was warned prior to the tour that including his son could create a conflict of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, you know, who cares about those minor details.\n\nHUD spokesman Raffi Williams told the Times that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t know the table had been purchased,\u201d but also that he does not believe it cost too much and he has no intentions of returning it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big \u201cSo fucking what\u201d for your ass, right?\n\n\u201cIn general, the secretary does want to be as fiscally prudent as possible with the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Williams added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nAlthough federal law requires that approval be sought from Congress if the cost of furnishing or redecorating the office of a department head costs more than $5,000, HUD did not request approval for the $31,561 purchase.\n\nWilliams told the Times that the department didn\u2019t seek approval because the dining set, which is located in Carson\u2019s 10th-floor office suite, served a \u201cbuildingwide\u201d need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is everyone eating lunch at that table or \u2026 ?\n\nAccording to the Times, Helen G. Foster\u2014a former top HUD official\u2014filed a complaint claiming that she was demoted and transferred after she pushed back on Candy Carson\u2019s request to work around the $5,000 redecoration law.\n\nCandy Carson\u2019s pressure reportedly began even before her husband was in his position as HUD secretary. Foster was instructed by HUD\u2019s interim secretary, Craig Clemmensen, to find money for Candy Carson to redecorate the office. He is reported to have said that \u201c$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Foster refused to comply, she was removed from her position as the department\u2019s chief administrative officer and made head of the agency\u2019s unit overseeing Freedom of Information Act requests. Foster viewed that as retribution for her noncompliance.\n\nWilliams says that Foster\u2019s reassignment was a routine agency reshuffle and denies that Candy Carson pressured Foster to help redecorate the office.\n\nSure, Jan.\n\n\u201cSecretary Carson, to the best of our knowledge, is the only secretary to go to the subbasement at his agency to select the furniture for his office,\u201d Williams said.", "keywords": ["budget", "carsons", "carson", "department", "candy", "officeredecoration", "office", "ben", "money", "cut", "secretary", "foster", "williams", "times", "hud", "wants", "funding"], "polarity": 0.05328683662016996, "subjectivity": 0.4115734060178505},

I was in a very deep state of depression, with many days so debilitating that my mattress felt like a tub of quicksand pulling me deeper into a dark, bottomless free fall. That I could make it out of bed was a miracle.\n\nI was too ashamed to ask for help, so I decided that the best route to ending my misery was a bullet to the head. But finding a gun legally in New York City proved to be challenging because of the city\u2019s stringent gun laws, which require residents to pay hundreds of dollars in application fees (pdf) and wait for months on end for approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is so hard to get a gun legally in New York City, some people have resorted to bribing cops to obtain a license.\n\nNot to mention, the New York City Police Department is known for stopping black and Latino men and women on the street at rates disproportionate to those of white New Yorkers, so I feared a stop would foil my plan to kill myself. So I Googled nearby states with less-restrictive gun laws and settled on Vermont because the state doesn\u2019t require a license to purchase a weapon or concealed-carry permit (pdf).\n\nFortunately, I got help and spent two years in therapy and a year on medication. I am fine now. I\u2019m sharing my story because, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), without citing any proof, suggested that Stephen Paddock may have been mentally ill and that that explains his actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned from these shootings is often underneath this is a diagnosis of mental illness,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the House of Representatives passed landmark mental-health reform just a year ago. That law is now being implemented. It\u2019s important that as we see the dust settle and we see what was behind some of these tragedies, that mental-health reform is a critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things from happening in the past.\u201d\n\nFor one, no evidence has been made public that Paddock suffered from a mental illness. What is so dangerous about Ryan\u2019s comments is that they conflate people who have serious mental-health issues with violent behavior.\n\nWhile the issue of mental illness is a complex one, the American Psychological Association found in a 2014 study that there is not usually a direct correlation between mental illness and crime. Asserting that mentally ill people have some proclivity for violence to cover up Congress\u2019 failure to pass sensible gun control laws further stigmatizes people who do not kill anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to mention, it is a pretty cowardly thing to do.\n\nWhat is equally egregious about Ryan\u2019s comments is that he is the leading person in Congress who wants to scrap the Affordable Care Act, a policy that has provided some much-needed structure for the first time ever for people needing mental-health and substance abuse help.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s proposed replacements, which, thankfully, have failed, would have made mental-health care even more expensive. I was lucky to have great health care connected to my job at the time, so I paid very little out of pocket proportionate to my salary. Most Americans who do not have employer-sponsored health care are not so lucky\u2014especially people of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if Ryan truly cared about the mentally ill, he would not be waging a war against Medicaid, which is the primary source (pdf) of funding mental-health and substance abuse treatment in the United States.\n\nIn addition to the help I got for depression, I really believe that New York City\u2019s strict gun laws saved my life. I was very determined to kill myself. Had I been able to go to a gun store and purchase a hand gun, I would have done it, and I would not be here today.\n\nWhat makes Ryan\u2019s remarks so offensive is that they push the mentally ill further into a closet. One of the reasons I didn\u2019t tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts was that I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was \u201ccrazy.\u201d I know, it\u2019s a loaded word, but that is the perception that those of us who have been depressed or have an ongoing mental illness deal with. I was truly afraid of speaking to someone for fear that he or she would assume I was a threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe do not know what Paddock\u2019s mental state was, so I will not speculate. What we do know is that he had more than two dozen guns on him and many more at his home. That was the problem, not some unverified mental-illness diagnosis from a U.S. congressman whose superficial thoughts and prayers for Paddock\u2019s victims do nothing to ensure that more of these mass shootings do not happen again.\n\nI will agree with Ryan that there is a mental illness in America: the country\u2019s refusal to drop its love affair with guns. New York City is not perfect. As a black resident, I am well aware of its ills and history with people of color, especially concerning its Police Department. But one thing New York City does right is ensure that no one can walk into a store and buy a gun without a vigorous background check. Even then, no one can conceal-carry, and semi-automatics are out of the question.\n\nIf people like Ryan spent more time trying to fix America\u2019s health care system as opposed to attacking the Affordable Care Act, more people would have access to the same lifesaving mental-health treatment that\u2019s responsible for me being here today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that will happen until we stop politicizing the mentally ill. They already have enough stereotypes to battle besides the ones pushed by some coward in Washington, D.C., who really doesn\u2019t care about their mental health or the people who died in Las Vegas Sunday night.\n\n", "keywords": ["killing", "mentally", "stopped", "care", "mentalhealth", "tough", "york", "illness", "ill", "mental", "nycs", "laws", "ryan", "city", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04111597244219195, "subjectivity": 0.5083506669482278},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["theories", "parkland", "fla", "used", "state", "douglas", "school", "shooting", "reform", "right", "seeking", "aide", "students", "survivors", "far", "gun", "stoneman"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

Terry McAuliffe stressed that it was \u201cnot likely\u201d that Hodgkinson held any ties to terrorist organizations. According to the New York Times, he did hold some resentment over Donald Trump\u2019s election. This, again, was a likely case of a lone-wolf, again, white man with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the gunman has since died from his injuries, he lived long enough to be taken to George Washington University Hospital, where the care he received is among the best in the region. His victims are all expected to recover.\n\nThe highest-profile of the shooting victims is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the Republican who represents the 1st Congressional District of Louisiana in the suburbs of New Orleans. Scalise was hit in the hip, and the surgery to repair his gunshot wound is reported by authorities to have been successful.\n\nAmid the platitudes about thoughts and prayers and unity that are all too common after such events, what we\u2019re not yet hearing is some common sense and some clear definitions to call a thing what it is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, this was indeed a terrorist act. Hunting down legislators, even those with whom one disagrees, is a crime that holds at its center the intent to make an example of the shot politician. The logic is simple: Vote my way or this could happen to you.\n\nThe man who perpetuated this terrorism was a terrorist.\n\nBlack shooters and brown shooters do not get such benefit of the doubt. If any black or brown person shoots and kills, one never hears the phrase, \u201cThis is an EDP,\u201d an \u201cemotionally disturbed person.\u201d Instead, cue the tired rhetoric, \u201cThis thug needs to be put down,\u201d or \u201cThose people practice a violent religion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe talk of mental illness is immediate when a white man takes up his arms and turns them against innocents. Despite that, the overwhelming majority of people who have mental illness never become violent, terroristic killers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if we are to grant that this particular shooter in the Alexandria incident did suffer from mental illness, there is still a main question to be answered. And it should be laid at the feet of Scalise and his similar-voting colleagues on Capitol Hill. We have to ask legislators, \u201cCan we talk about protecting Americans from the proven threat that is domestic terror?\u201d\n\nScalise holds an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. He also was on Donald Trump\u2019s Second Amendment Coalition, which wants to make it easier for residents of the District of Columbia to obtain guns. He has also fought to do away with provisions restricting mentally ill people from buying guns. Scalise co-sponsored the Firearms Interstate Commerce Reform Act, which aimed to remove restrictions on interstate firearms transactions.\n\nWhile the Second Amendment is treated as a sacred edict from the heavens, never to be touched, these are legislators who are happy to change laws about voting rights, equal access to women\u2019s health care and mental-health care as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese legislators, and much of the media, too, are far too comfortable with the status quo that white men with guns are the prime illustration of what it is to be an American\u2014no matter on whom they turn those weapons.\n\nIt was almost a year ago when GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul was uninjured Wednesday as he and other legislators fled the hail of gunfire while another lone-wolf white man with a gun unleashed his fury at unarmed people who couldn\u2019t defend themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s time to do more than wring our hands and talk about how futile it is to even make a request for a real conversation about this issue.\n\nCongress must absolutely get in line with medical professionals, who explain that gun violence is a public health issue, just like clean water and safe food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we must all do a better job in calling a terrorist a terrorist. Even if he\u2019s a \u201cnormal looking\u201d white man.\n\n\n\nNo one, not even GOP legislators, should be scared of being shot down in the outfield.", "keywords": ["white", "way", "legislators", "terrorist", "violence", "man", "talk", "sway", "normal", "shooter", "mental", "shooting", "va", "scalise", "gop", "gun"], "polarity": 0.03838569518716577, "subjectivity": 0.4320072084777966},

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

And realized way too late that Ryan is really not the one.\n\nNormally, in the black community, I feel we have a good idea of people not to test. We don\u2019t test our grandmothers, we usually don\u2019t test that one auntie who will ruthlessly clap back, etc.\n\nAlas, Patton, a black conservative and an event planner who somehow landed a job in the Trump administration at HUD without any prior housing experience, apparently doesn\u2019t have that sense of self-preservation and decided to come for Ryan, who is really that auntie.\n\nIt all started when Patton, who heads a regional HUD office overseeing New York and New Jersey, decided that it was a good idea to call Ryan \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d during a Twitter argument.\n\nThe now deleted tweet also had the hashtag #BankruptBlogger.\n\nApparently, according to the New York Daily News, the spat started when Ryan appeared on CNN and spoke about how she and other reporters have received death threats as a result of the president\u2019s attacks on the press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatton, who planned Eric Trump\u2019s wedding before she was appointed to HUD, took to Twitter to brush aside Ryan\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cAs a conservative black female who has publicly worked for & supported @realDonaldTrump, I\u2019ve been getting death threats from fellow minorities on the left for the past 3 years \u2014 so welcome to the club. @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe two continued to go back and forth before Patton fired the final shot: \u201cI hear #MissPiggys still on a rampage. Gee, I must\u2019ve struck a nerve, @AprilDRyan! #BankruptBlogger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout an hour later, Patton came to her senses, tweeting out an apology.\n\n\u201cI deleted my last tweet by choice. No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan,\u201d she wrote in the tweet. \u201cMy parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apology came a little too late, though. Because, remember, Ryan is really not the one you should try. This is the same reporter who has fearlessly stood her ground amid the disrespect she has faced while reporting on the Trump administration. This is the same reporter who casually asked Donald Trump \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event at the White House.\n\nSo naturally, Ryan responded with a swift and expert level of clapback-ery that had me clutching at my pearls and probably made Queen Rihanna of Clapbacks proud.\n\nFirst, because Ryan is a classy reporter, she of course had to fact-check Patton. She basically pulled a #FakeNews on a Trump official, and I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, when you\u2019re an event planner suddenly turned housing official, there are some receipts that have to be read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, leaving no stone unturned, as a proper reporter should, especially in a dragging, Ryan hit her with the \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with me?\u201d while seamlessly @ing Omarosa Manigault Newman, who has been accused of threatening Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, with a Mariah Carey level of shade, she wrapped it all up with a smooth, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nBut seriously, all drama aside, it is unthinkable that an official representing a presidential administration would conduct herself that way. Then again, everything is unprecedented and game in this administration, it seems, so perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, political pundit Armstrong Williams tweeted out to Ryan that he had spoken to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a longtime friend, who had attempted to reach out to Ryan on Thursday morning to apologize.\n\nRyan missed the call but is sure to follow up because, again\u2014and hopefully for the last time so these people can know\u2014April Ryan is NOT the one.", "keywords": ["realizes", "housing", "piggy", "apologize", "patton", "reporter", "administration", "calling", "trump", "test", "tries", "really", "ryan", "hud", "official", "miss", "late"], "polarity": 0.03126306165099268, "subjectivity": 0.4200148032044584},

Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club.

High School , some 91 miles northwest of Atlanta.\n\nThe incident unfolded around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday after some students attempted to get into Randal Davidson\u2019s classroom, but he refused to let them in, Dalton police spokesperson Bruce Frazier confirmed.\n\nThe students told the principal, who then came to the door and started to use his key to open it, however, Davidson forced the door closed on the principal. It was at that point that the principal heard a gunshot, sending terrified students scattering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had officers inside the building quickly,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nOfficers evacuated a hallway and secured the area. One student was hurt during the evacuation and had to be treated for an ankle injury.\n\nSome 30-45 minutes after the shot went off, law enforcement got Davidson to surrender, and he was taken into custody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had any dealings with him before,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nDavidson was well known as the longtime radio voice of Dalton High School football and basketball. The 53-year-old, who also teaches social studies, has been with Dalton High since 2004.\n\nFollowing the incident, students were relocated to the Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center, where parents and guardians were asked to pick them up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe terrifying incident at Dalton occurs some two weeks after 17 students and school employees were gunned down inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve. The state\u2019s Senate Appropriations Committee gave the nod to a similar bill later the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what if that armed teacher was in fact the aggressor instead of the savior?\n\nThe situation in Georgia could have ended a lot differently.

He was not the person they were looking for, but they saw that Scott was carrying a weapon when he exited his vehicle. After reportedly ignoring orders to drop his weapon, Scott was shot by Officer Brentley Vinson, a two-year member of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.\n\nIn North Carolina, the open carry of a handgun is legal, and concealed carry is legal with a permit.

With that said, let\u2019s dive right in.\n\nWe jump in right where we left off \u2013 with Yandy in the same dress that she wore to her first mixed gender middle school dance and Mandalay Bay showing off the finest in jailhouse couture. Standing at the altar, love brimming in their eyes\u2026they don\u2019t make the leap, citing a need to do it the right way, as the officiant who almost certainly was way more concerned about when he could go back to the slots feigned interest in their momentous decision. Content in their plan, Momofuku and his lady love return to New York so that they can select 32 lucky ladies to be in the bridal party for the Rikers\u2019 event of the century.*\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Yandy returns to NYC, she meets up with Tara inside of a sex store \u2013 because what better place is there to talk about love and commitment than in front of a bevy of heated dildoes? I\u2019m certain that the goddess Moniece Slaughter agrees with me on this. During this conversation, Tara confesses that she has yet to let the kids know that Peter and her were no longer together. (Note: To be fair, it\u2019s not like him not being in the house is much of a change of scenery for them). Struggling to not let her eyes roll to the back of her head, Yandy wisely advised Tara to disavow herself of the notion that her reasoning for not letting the kids know that her and Peter had split made the slightest bit of sense, and handed her a condom for good measure. Your guess is as good as mine on the last part.**\n\nNot to be outdone in this never ending love triangle, Amina gets some time to discuss just how much Peter has taken a wrecking ball to her life with her twin sister, who put down the Riesling and Sauerkraut and hopped on a flight across the Atlantic to console her. Miss Pankey\u2019s dignified chin trembled as she detailed Peter\u2019s continual absence at any and everything, including, but not limited to a family maternity shoot and a romantic date that he scheduled, concluding with the revelation that she didn\u2019t trust him. \u201cWhat a shocker!\u201d said no one who didn\u2019t have a tattoo of a heart on their chest plate. Peter flimsily offers up the justification that \u201cthe hustle is real\u201d and cited financial concerns, an assertion made all the more hilarious by him proposing taking Tara and the kids on an island vacation. I\u2019m tired. You tired. Jesus wept.\n\n[Panama Note: What Shamwow DIDN'T mention was that the romantic date he was flaking on with Amina ran concurrently with his day with his kids and Tara where he was trying to plan that family vacation that none of us are sure he can finance. Though he did say he wanted to take the kids to the beach so its entirely possible that they'll just go to Coney Island, which is hours from their Bronx home\u2026its damn near out of town.

Peter Gunz spends his days trolling love. ]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a surprising twist, Peter actually rectified a situation with a woman in his life: he and Erica Mena made up. Apparently, at some point Erica and Amina became the bestest of friends, which has prompted Erica to offer to throw Amina\u2019s baby shower.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019d like to propose a game: Mena\u2019s baby shower Mad Libs.\n\n\n\n\u201cI went to Erica Mena\u2019s baby shower and it was (adjective) .

All in all, a life changing experience.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of Erica, Erica and Cyn fought for the umpteenth time about how Erica engages in egregious relationship violations every time a bodega plays an Aventura song. Cyn gets fed up and decides that she needs a break. Pobrecita. Lucky for her there is a Chipotle walking distance from the Bergen St subway station they were standing in front of.\n\nErica and Chrissy got into it again, but nothing noteworthy came of that except for learning that \u201cfriend of the cast\u201d Rashidah has declared herself a \u201cstiletto expert.\u201d Since we\u2019re just self-appointing expertise these days, I\u2019d like to take this time to declare myself a Ratchet Expert. Nay, a Ratchet Connoiseur. A Rachetelier, if you will.\n\nLast, but oh-so-certainly not least, we get to Diamond and Cisco.\n\nIn the many years of this show and all of its associated spinoffs, I thought we had seen it all. I truly believed we had gotten to a point that there was next to nothing that Mona could throw my way that would phase me. I stand here before you all, yet again humbled by witchcraft and wizardry of Mona Scott Young.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast we left Diamond, she had moved to the Big Apple to chase love, leaving her young child*** behind with her mother. Upon arrival, her paramour Cisco grabbed her bag, wrapped her in a warm embrace\u2026and promptly informed her that she would be staying with a friend. It is at this point that we find out that not only will Diamond not be staying at her boyfriend of 2 years\u2019 place\u2026she has never seen his place and doesn\u2019t even know his address. Quoth Diamond \u201cI\u2019m tired of always f***ing in cars and meeting in public places\u2026.can we f*** in a bed for once?!\u201d [Panama Note: If I hadn't seen this with my own two eyes, I wouldn't believe it to be true. But I did see it and I was dazed and confused like Matthew McConaughey in 1994.]\n\nAs soon as I finish picking my jaw off the floor, the show hits me with the one hitter quitter. For all of Diamonds loud exclamations of wanting loyalty, commitment, and honesty, it is brought to light that Diamond has yet to inform him that she has a child, instead telling him that the background noise at her end of the phone line were of her dog. At the behest of an ultimatum served by her mother, Diamond informs Cisco, nochalantly stating \u201c speaking of loyalty and honesty\u2026I have a kid\u2026I want you guys to meet and we are all going to be one big happy family!!\u201d Cisco\u2019s response? \u201cDo me a favor and get the f*** away from me.\u201d\n\n[Panama Note: And she did actually say, upon being accused of lying by a nigga named Cisco that she didn't lie, she withheld information. But she didn't lie. Mind you, she just told us that every time she slipped up on the phone talking to her child, she informed him that she was talking to her puppy. I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure that shit qualifies as a lie in at least 27 countries, a few territories and at least one archipelago. If this even remotely resembles your life - and I mean all of it - dust yourself off and try again. Not sure what else to expect from the life of a chick named Diamond Strawberry, the most explicitly perfect stripper name of all time. This is not debatable.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo recap: Darryl Strawberry\u2019s daughter left her child/\u201dpuppy\u201d with her mom to have sex in cars with her noncommittal boyfriend on the West Side Highway - while awaiting his address so that she can finally submit her mail forwarding request. But hey, it's not like she cheated!\n\n\u2026I got nothing witty here guys. I'm just waiting for Sway to return my texts.\n\nJudging by the previews for next week it gets even messier. Seems to be that Diamond isn\u2019t the only one with a secret kid. Top that off with Cyn and Erica arguing over feenin\u2019 for the peen, and it looks like Love and Hip Hop NY is making a solid effort to come back strong in the New Year. It\u2019s a Christmas Miracle!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*How romantic is it that Mendecee(s) put his conjugal visits at risk so that Yandy could have her dream wedding? This must be that Ghetto Love that Thi Thi was singing about.\n\n**I\u2019d like to think they bought a heated dildo as well, but the jury\u2019s still out on that part. It's what Moniece would've wanted.\n\n***I\u2019m gonna go with Mylanta as her child\u2019s name. This sounds correct. [Panama Note: Her daughter's name is Mylisa as opposed to Melissa, I suppose.

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ... Never feeling like that must be the ultimate privilege.\n\nBut then again, I am a black man ...\n\nAn apology.", "keywords": ["white", "atlantic", "safe", "david", "man", "culture", "feel", "carry", "french", "sentient", "love", "article", "weapon", "privilege", "gun", "sweet", "black"], "polarity": 0.06059433621933622, "subjectivity": 0.4263154761904762},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["terrorist", "second", "nras", "organization", "legal", "right", "deaths", "nra", "dont", "gun", "directly"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["approved", "teachers", "moving", "florida", "legislature", "forward", "dangerous", "armed", "school", "program", "children", "laws", "educators", "students", "especially", "gun", "schools", "black"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

Already, the massive storm\u2014the largest ever recorded in the Atlantic\u2014is pummeling every island in the Caribbean that comes across its path. It is unclear just how much devastation it will bring, but forecasters and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have offered scenarios nothing short of terrifying.\n\nThis hurricane season has shown itself to be quite the nightmare, but one\u2019s fears only heighten after considering this nugget that makes this scenario all the more spine-chilling: Ben Carson is in charge of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, the brain surgeon who sounded like a damn fool throughout the entire Republican presidential primary season. To his credit, he sounded like a damn fool before the primary, given that he would do things like compare Obamacare to slavery, along with other random acts of asininity. Ben Carson, who often just stands there for decoration\u2014probably because he was a neurosurgeon and self-help-book writer who somehow became the head of a federal agency despite having no experience in government, much less housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in March, Carson gave his first speech to his new department and made HUD employees take a \u201cniceness pledge,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nDuring that same speech, he also said this, according to New York magazine:\n\n\u201cEvery human being, regardless of their ethnicities, or their background, they have a brain: the human brain. It remembers everything you\u2019ve ever seen, everything you\u2019ve ever heard. I could take the oldest person here, make a little hole right here on the side of the head, and put some depth electrodes into their hippocampus\u2014and stimulate\u2014and they would be able to read back to you, verbatim, a book they read 60 years ago.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t overload the human brain,\u201d Carson explained. \u201cSo we need to focus a little less on what we can\u2019t do and a little more on what we can do. After all, this is America, the \u2018can-do society\u2019 \u2014 not the, \u2018what can you do for me\u2019 society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson\u2019s first speech was to ask employees to take a niceness pledge while arguing against government handouts. This nitwit didn\u2019t even pass his own pledge of kindness.\n\nA month later, Politico reported:\n\nCarson told Politico that policy proposals are in the works, but in public appearances the one-time presidential candidate is sticking to his stump-speech staples. He prescribes \u201cgodly principles\u201d as a cure for the country\u2019s political division and praises housing advocates for \u201cputting God\u2019s love into action.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of God, which I love to do; quite frankly, he\u2019s a great guy,\u201d Carson said on March 28, drawing friendly laughter during a speech to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. \u201cWe should be grateful that God gave us variety. But you know what he didn\u2018t give us variety in? The brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe month after that, NPR reported:\n\nOn Wednesday night, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 whose budget to help low-income households would be cut by more than $6 billion next year \u2014 added his own thoughts. He said in a radio interview that \u201cpoverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.\u201d Carson \u2014 who himself grew up in poverty to become a widely acclaimed neurosurgeon \u2014 said people with the \u201cright mind set\u201d can have everything taken away from them, and they\u2019ll pull themselves up. He believes the converse is true as well. \u201cYou take somebody with the wrong mind-set, you can give them everything in the world [and] they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson tried to clarify his comments, but, spoiler, he repeated the same sentiment with phrasing that was the Tia to its original statement\u2019s Tamera. Not even Tahj or Tavior Mowry, but Tamera.\n\n\n\nOn the Monday following Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall and the historic rainfall it quickly brought to Texas, Secretary Carson released a statement assuring that HUD would be there for victims in need.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] begins to assess the damage and respond to the immediate needs of residents, HUD will be there to offer assistance and support the longer-term housing recovery efforts,\u201d Carson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat followed was a bulleted list of HUD\u2019s efforts, but one wonders, can Carson get any of it done? This question is spurred not only by Carson\u2019s own past remarks but also by a new report outlining just how poorly run HUD is under Carson\u2019s leadership.\n\nDays before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ProPublica published \u201cIs Anybody Home at HUD?,\u201d which highlighted the decimation of a vital federal agency under Carson.\n\nProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis noted that now-former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d back in February. The administration\u2019s initial budget called for deep cuts to HUD\u2014cuts the Washington Post\u2019s Lisa Rein highlights \u201cwould slice away funding for long-term preparedness efforts, many of them put in place to address the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. 45 picked the perfect person to run an agency for which he and those around him have great disdain.\n\nAs MacGillis reports, the plan is going exactly as it is designed:\n\nAs I watched the hearings, it occurred to me that Carson was the perfect HUD secretary for Donald Trump, the real-estate-developer president who appears to care little for public housing. He offered a gently smiling refutation to accusations from any corner that the department\u2019s evisceration would have grave consequences. After all, Ben Carson had made it from Detroit to Johns Hopkins without housing assistance, a point of pride in his family. Not to mention that Carson\u2019s very identity \u2014 theoretically \u2014 helped inoculate the administration against charges of prejudice. (Just last week, Carson said, in the wake of racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, that the controversy over Trump\u2019s support of white supremacists there was \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d and echoed the president\u2019s \u201cboth sides\u201d language when referring to \u201chatred and bigotry.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd like 45, Carson keeps family around where they don\u2019t belong:\n\nThen there was the mystery of why Carson\u2019s family was taking such a visible role in the department. There was the omnipresent Mrs. Carson. Even more striking, however, had been the active role of the secretary\u2019s second-oldest son. Ben Carson Jr., who goes by B.J. and co-founded an investment firm in Columbia, Maryland, that specializes in infrastructure, health care and workforce development, was showing up on email chains within the department and appearing often at headquarters. One day, he was seen leaving the 10th-floor office of David Eagles, the new COO, who was crafting a HUD reorganization to accompany the cuts.\n\nAn anonymous source told ProPublica of Carson: \u201cPeople feel disrespected. They see Carson and think, I\u2019ve been in housing policy for 20 or 30 years, and if I walked away, I would never expect to get hired as a nurse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen Carson is a religious zealot who makes the mistake of personalizing poverty in a way that is detrimental to those who know that for every rarity that is Ben Carson, there are many others who continue to languish in a system designed to keep them stuck where they are.\n\nIn reality, more often than not, people have to be given opportunities to get out of poverty. They need adequate housing, they need support and they need a helping hand. Even if Carson is a brain surgeon who doubles as a village idiot, one would think even he would understand that the difference between him and the man who gave him a job for which he is unqualified had everything handed to him\u2014which promised him a much more certain fate than Carson had as a child.\n\n\n\nIt was already worrisome that a man who thinks poverty is a state of mind was in charge of an organization designed to help the poorest among us. It\u2019s even worse now that the poorest of Houston have been affected by a natural disaster, only to seek refuge in an organization that lacks staffing, resources and competency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHUD is supposed to rebuild homes, parks, hospitals and community centers. Carson behaves as if he couldn\u2019t build a paper plane at his office in their building. How petrified should most of them be?\n\nIn response to the story, Carson said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 Special Report: \u201cI would say that you should ring the doorbell before you conclude that nobody\u2019s at home. I don\u2019t think they did a very good job at journalistic investigation there.\u201d\n\nWell, this is your chance to show and prove, you brain-dead brain surgeon. I don\u2019t have much faith in you, but for the sake of my home state of Texas, Florida and whatever other areas are affected, I\u2019m praying you don\u2019t fuck up.\n\n", "keywords": ["housing", "carson", "state", "head", "victims", "hurricane", "ben", "brain", "need", "poverty", "petrified", "hud", "speech"], "polarity": 0.11839024423136571, "subjectivity": 0.449990424943696},

Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["white", "donald", "lives", "im", "stuff", "solved", "crime", "racist", "trump", "right", "nra", "plan", "matter", "know", "gun", "think", "black"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. \u201c#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren\u2019t \u2018people,\u2019\u201d Giampa tweeted that day.\ufeff\n\nAnd this:\n\nA white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals \u201csounds like heaven,\u201d Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["white", "tied", "nicholas", "nationalist", "teen", "jews", "neonazi", "murder", "huffpost", "heres", "illness", "identifies", "mental", "young", "charged", "disturbing", "twitter", "gun", "tweeted"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

Recently the Michigan Chronicle, a historically black newspaper from Ben Carson\u2019s hometown of Detroit, referred to Carson as the \u201cshame of Detroit\u201d and said that he was in competition for the \u201cHouse Negro of the Year Award.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain didn\u2019t take too kindly to that, and the former Republican presidential candidate wrote a post on his website blasting the paper for using the term.\n\nHe took it a step further on Wednesday when he wrote another post, titled, \u201cHouse Negroes Stand Up!\u201d in which he laments that he, too, has been referred to as a house Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey say it to me too, Dr. Ben Carson, because just like you, I refuse to embrace the backward thinking of today\u2019s black identity politics,\u201d Cain writes.\n\nHe goes on to say that since the Chronicle thinks Carson is a house Negro, then he, Cain, must be one, too, because that\u2019s \u201cone of the names you get called by other black people when you are a success at something, and you do not buy into \u2018black group think\u2019 or act and say what they want you to say.\u201d\n\nNo, sir, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite how that moniker is earned, but please, continue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain then goes on to criticize the current movement to have Confederate monuments removed, calling it a \u201cwaste of time and distractions,\u201d and saying that the Chronicle may not have noticed the \u201csuccessful black people\u201d in \u201cprominent positions in America\u201d because they mind their business like the good black folk they are, focusing on \u201cperformance and productive opportunities\u201d rather than worrying about the past.\n\nOK.\n\nThen Cain gets all \u201cHe won\u2019t say it, but I will,\u201d like he is really about to read someone or something, and says:\n\nGentle Dr. Ben Carson is too nice to respond to that garbage article and name-calling by the Michigan Chronicle, but I\u2019m not! Let\u2019s start with the fact that he prayed hard about even accepting the HUD job. Personally, I was glad he accepted it, because he will bring \u201coutside the box\u201d ideas and thinking to HUD. Many of the old ways of doing things have left many of our urban areas unchanged for 50 years, and too many of our young people have been trapped in cycles of poverty, crime and weak educations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh? Have we witnessed any of this so-called outside-the-box thinking and ideas? What has Carson brought to the table since joining the Department of Housing and Urban Development?\n\nCain then stresses for us that Carson \u201cdidn\u2019t become a world-renowned brain surgeon by being a \u2018house Negro,\u2019\u201d but I don\u2019t think anyone has made that allegation, so I think this is another instance of you keep using that phrase, but I don\u2019t think you understand what it means, Herman.\n\nHe writes that Carson could have taken any other \u201cbetter paying and less stressful\u201d job in the world, but he chose to \u201cserve his country and a president who is truly trying to create a better America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is where I have to stop you for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Carson is not making some huge sacrifice for other Americans, and most especially not for other black Americans, so let\u2019s just be real about that.\n\nSecond, Donald Trump is not trying to create a better America for anyone who looks like you, you misguided darkie. Like, for real, for real. Get your head out of your ass and wake up. You acting real Stacey Dash right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continues:\n\nThe Michigan Chronicle thanks Dr. Carson for his sacrifice and dedication by calling him a nasty insulting name. It\u2019s the usual attempt to try to discredit his patriotism and to discourage him. Knowing Dr. Carson, that old tactic ain\u2019t going to work.\n\nNo, I\u2019m pretty sure they are just calling him out for behavior that seeks to set him apart from other blacks in the country as if he is somehow better than everyone else. He is uplifting a president that is doing everything in his power to enable the constant and persistent persecution of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain goes on to say that there are plenty of black folks not drinking the \u201cname-calling brand of Kool-Aid,\u201d and we see a hint of his black roots showing themselves for a brief instant. He ruins the moment, though, by reiterating the point that those same black folks are being good and minding their business and not giving Massa no trouble like the rest of us darkies:\n\nBeing called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is just one of the insulting names I have been called as an ABC (American Black Conservative), simply because I do not subscribe to the black liberal backward-looking narrative of black identity politics. Maybe that\u2019s why I have had multiple successful careers over the last 50 years, and name-calling has not stopped or slowed me down yet! If being called a \u201chouse Negro\u201d is what some of us must endure for succeeding in this nation and thinking for ourselves, then let all of the \u201chouse Negroes\u201d stand up and be counted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLOL.

Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law professor quoted in the Raw Story article, said, state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Story also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet-fuel-tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans had threatened to pull their support.\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, also responded to Cagle, criticizing the lieutenant governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon.com\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time magazine, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["threatening", "georgia", "second", "state", "discounts", "hes", "biggest", "loves", "employers", "wannabe", "cagle", "raw", "young", "nra", "states", "tax", "delta", "governor", "lawmakers"], "polarity": -0.020344635523206957, "subjectivity": 0.356445043052186},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["terrorist", "second", "nras", "organization", "legal", "right", "deaths", "nra", "dont", "gun", "directly"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Several years ago we bought a farm in rural Maryland. One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. More recently our home in Virginia along with that of a neighbor was vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road. We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let\u2019s use the right tools. By the way, that neighbor who put up the Confederate flag subsequently became friendly. That is the likely outcome if we just learn to be neighborly and to get to know each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust think about 1) how terrible this fucking story is and 2) how delusional Narcoleptic Shaft must be to think that it\u2019s inspiring or engaging or uplifting or anything other than proof that this nigga needs to move.

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

Paris is no longer Paris.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out that Jim doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn this new millennium, it\u2019s become the way of the politician not only to create an imaginary friend but also to use said friend to advance a political agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump does this a lot, conjuring friends who don\u2019t exist. He claims that someone close to him has something to say, and that something is always in alignment with Trump\u2019s feelings. But that\u2019s because Trump is pathological. He\u2019s an ill-equipped communicator on the world stage and hardly trying to be loved. And never forget that Trump\u2019s agenda is always to push separatism, so he uses his imaginary friends for just such a reason.\n\nBut not all imaginary friends are the same; nor do they serve the same purpose. While Trump\u2019s friend Jim was used to send an anecdotal message about what happens when you open up the borders of a country, Booker and Carson have invented or embellished friends for quite a different reason: inclusion.\n\nWhen Cory Booker, now a senator from New Jersey, was mayor of Newark, N.J., he spoke of T-Bone. T-Bone was a ruthless drug lord from Jersey\u2019s Brick Towers low-income housing development who once threatened to kill Booker. T-Bone was also mentioned whenever Booker was trying to sell a story of how he understood the woes of growing up in a tough city like Newark. T-Bone became both Booker\u2019s hood pass and his mentee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how T-Bone was first introduced during a 2007 speech at the New School in New York City, according to NJ.com:\n\n\u201cI said hello to this guy and I\u2019ll never forget he leaped off the steps where he was standing and looked at me and threatened my life,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI later got to know this guy and his name was T-Bone and I\u2019m a vegetarian so that was a particularly vicious threat,\u201d Booker said to big laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker would later claim that T-Bone would come to him for legal advice.\n\nAfter being called out about T-Bone\u2019s legitimacy, Booker noted that T-Bone was real. Whether or not his name is actually T-Bone, though, has yet to be proved.\n\n\u201cHe is an archetype of so many people that are out there. He is 1,000 percent a real person,\u201d Booker said in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen NJ.com explored why people didn\u2019t call out Booker\u2019s questionable use of T-Bone, a telling answer came from Rahaman Muhammad, a city union leader who at the time was one of Booker\u2019s strongest critics.\n\n\u201cHe actually has real experiences that he can share,\u201d Muhammad told NJ.com. \u201cTo me this does not disqualify him from being a U.S. senator. These are urban stories that many of us have in this city. There may be different names, but there are many of these types of stories. Unfortunately, he made up a character for his story.\u201d\n\nNo politician, however, has done as masterly a job of deploying this narrative as former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, now secretary of housing and urban development. During his failed run for the White House, Carson weaved tales of debauchery and street toughness as if he were the black Chuck Norris. He once claimed that he stopped a stickup merely by pointing the robber toward the cash register. Most black people knew he was lying because he said that the alleged robbery attempt happened at a \u201cPopeyes organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is how CNN described Carson\u2019s tall tales:\n\nIn his 1990 autobiography, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, Carson describes those acts as flowing from an uncontrollable \u201cpathological temper.\u201d The violent episodes he has detailed in his book, in public statements and in interviews, include punching a classmate in the face with his hand wrapped around a lock, leaving a bloody three-inch gash in the boy\u2019s forehead; attempting to attack his own mother with a hammer following an argument over clothes; hurling a large rock at a boy, which broke the youth\u2019s glasses and smashed his nose; and, finally, thrusting a knife at the belly of his friend with such force that the blade snapped when it luckily struck a belt buckle covered by the boy\u2019s clothes. \u201cI was trying to kill somebody,\u201d Carson said, describing the incident\u2014which he has said occurred at age 14 in ninth grade\u2014during a September forum at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. But nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson told CNN they have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is from a Yale-educated brain surgeon! The saddest part here is that Carson didn\u2019t feel that being one of the most decorated neurosurgeons was enough. He still needed a phoenixlike rise from the ashes of a hood like Baltimore to add legitimacy to his narrative.\n\nUnlike Trump, who is habitually horrible and is using everything at his disposal to destroy America, Booker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will\u2014for the crowd to show that they can move freely within both worlds.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a conundrum that all educated black men face: What do degrees mean inside the barbershop, and what does barbershop talk mean inside the hallowed halls of an Ivy League school? The funniest part of both Carson\u2019s and Booker\u2019s tales is that even in their use, they actually show how removed both men are.\n\n\u201cBlack men, almost by their very nature, have to perform. And Cory\u2014to some extent, the blackest part of him is that performance ethos,\u201d historian Clement Price told Esquire back in 2008 about Booker\u2019s friend T-Bone. The same could apply to Carson.\n\nBooker and Carson suffer from \u201cnonhood-black-man syndrome\u201d: They don\u2019t feel black enough when talking about their American experience, so they embellish portions of their upbringing\u2014blacken them up, if you will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imaginary friend in Carson\u2019s narrative and Booker\u2019s exploratory use of T-Bone helps bolster their respective street cred, and in some regards, a politician needs street cred almost as much as a rapper does. When stumping for office, a politician needs stories that show not only that he will he lead the people but also that he is of the people. That he\u2019s one of them. That he, too, has had to fend off drug dealers.\n\nAnd so, in a weird, political way, the story of T-Bone becomes a Dickensian tale about the downturn of life, and serves as the foil to Booker the protagonist and his uplifting bootstraps. T-Bone serves an anecdotal purpose in the same way that we don\u2019t know if there was ever a real Brenda in Tupac\u2019s life, but we know that \u201cshe barely had a brain\u201d and that is was \u201ca damn shame that the girl could hardly spell her name.\u201d The \u201clife story\u201d somehow becomes the life.\n\nWe don\u2019t know Brenda, and nor do we care if she exists, but we know that Brenda speaks for a larger community, and that is what attracts us to Brenda\u2019s story. We know that she has struggled; we know that she is unable to handle the rigors of raising a newborn baby while still being a child herself. We feel for her. But in the end, it\u2019s a story, a fictional tale, an imagined hardship, a lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe political landscape is changing, but the anecdotal story of a friend who once did something bad is as old as America itself. It has been employed by parents and teachers who warn of the bad kid who didn\u2019t listen and, as a result, ended up dead, so is it bad that politicians have not only employed fake friends but have mentored them, taken their advice, stabbed them in a rage-filled moment?\n\nThere is a theory that says it\u2019s OK to talk to an imaginary friend, but seek help should that friend start talking back.\n\nI think we may have jumped the shark.", "keywords": ["politicians", "donald", "carson", "friend", "political", "ben", "imaginary", "trump", "bookers", "friends", "tbone", "know", "real", "booker"], "polarity": -0.04338607752400856, "subjectivity": 0.44266924167786226},

Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they\u2019ll be right back up there,\u201dthe Washington Post reports.\n\n\u201cAnd you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they\u2019ll work their way right back down to the bottom,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who ran for president in 2016, and before entering into politics, he was a motivational speaker. He regularly discussed the fact that he grew up in poverty, and Lifetime found his life story so compelling, the network turned it into the TV movie Gifted Hands, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. While the biopic set him up to be an inspiration to poor kids everywhere, his conservative politics, constant denunciations of government assistance and the way his foot is always in his mouth have made most people give him an extreme side eye.\n\nCarson\u2019s comments were made during a town hall recorded Tuesday to air in full Wednesday night, and clips of the interview were released to news organizations to promote the show, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson said \u201cthe wrong mindset\u201d is the product of negative parenting habits and exposure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a poverty spirit. You develop a certain mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Carson said he believes the government can help people looking to climb out of poverty, he warned against programs that are \u201csustaining them in a position of poverty. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the majority of people don\u2019t have that defeatist attitude, but they sometimes just don\u2019t see the way, and that\u2019s where government can come in and be very helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can provide the ladder of opportunity, it can provide the mechanism that will demonstrate to them what can be done.\u201d\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint, unveiled Tuesday, would cut more than $6 billion from HUD\u2019s budget. The cuts would end popular grants that facilitate first-time home ownership and revitalize economically distressed communities, including the Community Development Block Grant. The budget would also cut billions of dollars in funding for public housing support, gutting dollars used to fund big-ticket repairs at public housing developments around the country. Carson has spoken at length in the past about personal responsibility and its intersection with poverty, bemoaning systemic dependence on public assistance. On the campaign trail, Carson repeatedly pushed back against accusations that he wanted to end social safety net programs; he stressed, instead, that he believed government assistance was not always given to people who truly needed it. \u201cI have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people,\u201d he said in the 2015 speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not doing people a favor when we pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing, we\u2019re going to take care of all your needs. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u2019 You know who else says stuff like that? Socialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment, but Williams did, and in an interview with the Post Wednesday evening, he defended Carson and said his views are based not on politics but on what is just.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of faith, not a man of politics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson believes in what is righteous, what is good, what is fair and what is just.\u201c\n\nSo remember, kids, poverty is just a state of mind.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["shouldnt", "florida", "enforcement", "proposed", "ranks", "gov", "law", "school", "yes", "mental", "trump", "rick", "nra", "weapons", "scott", "health", "gun", "celebrate"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats.

And by \u201carranged,\u201d I mean that she arranges times in which she is forced to watch her giant ball of old earwax devour a bucket of Original Recipe. Or arranges public appearances or official cutoff times for the contractual presidential coupling.\n\n\n\nMelania Trump doesn\u2019t strike me as the type of person who keeps up with her husband. I honestly believe that there is a person in the White House whose job it is to spin the president\u2019s policy and rhetoric so that Melania actually believes the stupid shit she tweets. On Monday, the observed day of the birth of America\u2019s most prominent civil rights icon\u2014a day when other presidents have spent their days giving back, and her dumbass husband was playing golf\u2014 Melania had the audacity to tweet that the U.S. is currently striving for \u201cequality and justice for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. & his service to this great country. I am honored to be First Lady of a nation that continually strives for equality & justice for all. # MLKDay,\u201d she wrote on Monday.\n\nYep, just days after her husband\u2014who has been a KFC-greased hot rod for racist commentary\u2014called several black and brown countries shitholes, she tweeted that with the wide-eyed fanaticism of a young Simba before his father\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, I\u2019m kidding; Melania\u2019s ass has always been trash, and she knows that her husband ain\u2019t shit.\n\nBut what is actually perplexing about this administration, its supporters and the talking heads on Fake News Fox News is that its members quadruple down on their racism, only to try to act as if they aren\u2019t, in fact, racist. While Donald Trump\u2019s lazy ass was golfing, the White House issued a statement celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy: \u201cDr. King\u2019s dream is our dream. It is the American Dream. It\u2019s the promise stitched into the fabric of our Nation, etched into the hearts of our people, and written into the soul of humankind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president also said of King\u2019s dream, Newsweek reports: \u201cIt is the dream of a world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from. It is the dream of a nation that offers a life of dignity and hope to every American regardless or color or creed.\u201d\n\nWhy even send the tweet or issue a statement in the first place, when everything coming out of this administration has been contradictory? You don\u2019t care about King\u2019s service to this country, especially considering that the previous president, who has been a disciple of King\u2019s legacy, has served as Donald Trump\u2019s template for what not to do. Donald has spent his first year in office undoing Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, while casually emboldening white supremacy and white nationalism.\n\n\n\nMelania married the man, so she gets no slack. She knew who he was before he took office, and I know it\u2019s early in the day, but she\u2019s seen him naked. She\u2019s the woman behind the man who wants to end the world as we know it, and you don\u2019t get to shy away from that now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing was shot down fighting to end everything that the White House now represents, so I say this with all due respect: Keep the good reverend\u2019s name out of your mouth and off your complicit fingers.\n\nRead more at Newsweek.", "keywords": ["white", "nation", "day", "trumps", "donald", "mlk", "husband", "dream", "delusional", "kings", "deplorable", "house", "melania", "legacy", "proves"], "polarity": 0.02392557651991614, "subjectivity": 0.4216719077568135},

Through his social media posts, it was clear to me that Wade was charismatic, unassuming and bright and navigated the world in a very self-assured way. What was also evident was his genuine love for people and for his community. Put simply, Wade was a star who was wise beyond his years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, he also became a victim of gun violence and was taken from us this past Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nAccording to KPRC Click2Houston, Wade and 29-year-old Mario Jerrell Williams reportedly got into a heated argument. A witness reported seeing Williams leave the bedroom of Wade\u2019s home in Atascocita, Texas, apparently upset. The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him repeatedly to leave, which he finally did, according to the police report.\n\nWilliams returned, and moments later, the witness heard two gunshots and ran out, only to see Wade\u2019s twin brother, Stephen, asking someone to call 911, KPRC reports. Williams later turned himself in to the police and is currently being held at Harris County Jail in Texas on $100,000 bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after his death, many media outlets began framing this killing as a violent lover\u2019s quarrel\u2014a crime of passion, perhaps. I will never forget sitting in criminal law and procedure classes in 2009, as a first-year law student, thinking about the nonsense of certain \u201ccrimes of passion.\u201d\n\nSome crimes of passion are deeply connected to possession, ownership, jealousy and ideas of romanticism. None of that is truly connected to passion, and it certainly isn\u2019t connected to love\u2014not the kind any of us should find to be true, anyway. Society owes it to all people to do a better job of discussing the ways that intimate-partner violence (pdf) affects all communities, but especially ones that are often forgotten, like black queer and transgender populations.\n\nStill, Wade\u2019s close friends make clear that what\u2019s most important is how we\u2014as writers, academics and folks at the margins\u2014frame how he lived, especially when mainstream media may find it more valuable to sensationalize how he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Wade\u2019s life reminds us of the importance of calling into question love, romance and desire in black queerdom. He reminds us of the critical dialogue we should have on how toxic masculinity and patriarchy become increasingly dangerous when compounded with feelings of unrequited love and attraction. His life and death call to attention the ways in which violence cannot be viewed through a narrow prism when we\u2019re considering the intersections of blackness and queerness.\n\nBut that is not the extent of his legacy. Wade worked fervently so that those without a \u201cbright future\u201d\u2014individuals who often fall between the cracks of mass incarceration, poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia\u2014would not be forgotten.\n\nThat memory should not be erased.\n\n\u201cDevon Wade was a force, an angel amongst men. He was a gentle spirit, who generated electricity in all spaces he dwelled,\u201d said Jeffrey McCune of Washington University in St. Louis, a mentor and friend to Wade. \u201cHis life\u2019s work, examining the impact of incarcerated parents on children, was to be a shape-shifter to the sociology of education. He is sorely missed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade understood firsthand the direct impact that mass incarceration had on young people and families. As he was growing up, both his mother and father were in prison, so he was raised by his grandparents. But from all accounts, instead of blaming his parents, he realized their personal struggles and he decided to tackle oppressive systems\u2014such as the prison-industrial complex\u2014and how they affect black communities.\n\nWhile a student at M.B. Smiley High School, Wade enrolled in No More Victims, a program for young people whose parents are incarcerated. Wade eventually became an honors graduate at Louisiana State University, a Harry S. Truman scholar and then a doctoral student at Columbia in New York City, studying sociology. He talked about these experiences often, how they collectively shaped his work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and how he had to unpack his own trauma.\n\nIn the YouTube clip \u201cWho Is: Devon Tyrone Wade,\u201d Wade noted, \u201cI had not yet necessarily had that conversation with my parents about what their being in prison meant for me. And even though I had in most cases excelled \u2026 there were a whole host of things that impacted me in ways I kept inside.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, not only was Wade able to find his own voice, but he was also able to empower others to find theirs.\n\n\n\nWade\u2019s work was focused on not just what happens when we lock up individuals but also what happens to their families. What happens to those communities? What happens to returning citizens once they are released from prison? Wade wanted to create a society that allowed for the most marginalized to survive and thrive by providing resources and also by understanding how trauma is punished for already at-risk youths.\n\n\u201cWhat we will miss from [Wade] is that he speaks assuredly but not abrasively so. He is inclusive, welcoming, warm and wanted his work to extend beyond nonacademics,\u201d close friend and colleague Adam Smith told The Root. \u201cHe wanted to make sure his work was not just contributing to the research but to the people that needed it the most.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade was a budding scholar, a critical thinker and a person known by everyone to show compassion for marginalized communities. He was taken from us by way of gun violence, despite doing what society told us was \u201cright.\u201d Although we can\u2019t bring Wade back, we must continue passing the torch by uplifting often-forgotten people, the alleged downtrodden, those whom society further pushes into the margins.\n\nWhat happened to Wade shouldn\u2019t have happened. He should still be with us and those who loved him most in the world. It is now our responsibility to continue pushing and thinking of collateral consequences of the prison-industrial complex and policing of neighborhoods, and make sure that his life\u2019s work was not in vain.", "keywords": ["remembered", "merely", "disrupting", "violence", "wades", "student", "prison", "wade", "williams", "died", "work", "parents", "devon", "wanted", "ways", "pipeline", "society"], "polarity": 0.1564536066343295, "subjectivity": 0.5571249500165161},

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much.

The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him several times to leave, which he finally did, according to the report.\n\nThe witness said that Williams then again returned to the home and was once again asked to leave, with Wade escorting him from a bedroom to the first floor of the home.

I've read several articles about this because I've honestly been trying to understand and what I've come up with is that there is no understanding to be had. Why an HBCU would chose to pick a member of Trump's administration so aggressively hostile towards minority communities and, frankly, actual education, is beyond me.\n\nI don't know if common sense is on vacation, and recent ads for damn near everything insinuate that to the be the case, but an actual Black institution of higher learning taking such a transparent stance towards ass kissing is embarrassing. That is the only plausible reason why anybody from this administration would be asked, especially Betsy DeVos, a woman who released an ENTIRE press release that explicitly outlined her lack of knowledge about why HBCUs even exist.\n\nLet her come to the school to sit down and be educated. Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison.

When it to comes to black folks, he would very much like for us to stop whining about voting rights, police brutality and the Confederacy\u2019s right to flex. In short: Return to the bottom of the totem pole and be happy we\u2019re not hanging from it. As for LGBTQ people, we best take all those letters and report to the nearest closet and/or conversion therapy appointment.\n\n\n\nWith respect to Americans collectively, he highly recommends that the only greenery we consume be served on a plate (though optional to be prepped by a black cook named Mabel on an Alabama plantation).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile white supremacy\u2019s Southern legal beagle is certainly hard at work on all of those goals, he\u2019s been remarkably aggressive in his pursuit against weed.\n\n\n\nIn the New York Times piece \u201cStates Keep Saying Yes to Marijuana Use. Now Comes the Federal No.,\u201d Avantika Chilkoti writes:\n\n\n\nA task force Mr. Sessions appointed to, in part, review links between violent crimes and marijuana is scheduled to release its findings by the end of the month. But he has already asked Senate leaders to roll back rules that block the Justice Department from bypassing state laws to enforce a federal ban on medical marijuana. That has pitted the attorney general against members of Congress across the political spectrum\u2014from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, to Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey\u2014who are determined to defend states\u2019 rights and provide some certainty for the multibillion-dollar pot industry. \u201cOur attorney general is giving everyone whiplash by trying to take us back to the 1960s,\u201d said Representative Jared Huffman, Democrat of California, whose district includes the so-called Emerald Triangle that produces much of America\u2019s marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs soon as Attorney General \u201cSegregation Now, Segregation Forever\u201d was confirmed, many marijuana activists worried about just how aggressive he would be in taking on the weed legalization happening in states across the country. After all, Sessions is the same person who infamously joked that he thought that Ku Klux Klan was \u201cOK until I found out they smoked pot.\u201d That\u2019s so funny, I could take a piss on every white sheet he owns.\n\n\n\nBut while it remains to be seen how successful Sessions will be in taking on the states over the issue of the legalization of recreational and medicinal marijuana usage (isn\u2019t it hysterical that a man named Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III plans to infringe on states\u2019 rights?), he seems to have other tricks up his sleeve to further soil the name of glorious marijuana.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) conference, Sessions had this to say about the old and long-proven-to-be-ineffective program:\n\nD.A.R.E. is, I think, the best remembered anti-drug program today. In recent years, people have not paid much attention to that message, but they are ready to hear it again. \u2026 We know it worked before, and we can make it work again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: In elementary school, I won a D.A.R.E. essay contest.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember the prize, but I won it in fifth grade\u2014around the same time my then-slender frame started to hastily widen after I started consuming 20-piece Chicken McNugget orders solo dolo in what I would later learn in life constituted emotional eating\u2014so I imagine the prize was probably some Pizza Hut coupon or some shit like that. I would show you the picture, but I didn\u2019t dare bother my mama to go in my room back in Houston to go find wherever I left my old elementary school yearbook to show you the photograph that was featured inside. Just trust me, y\u2019all.\n\n\n\nI also recall my music teacher, Mrs. Thompson, forcing us to learn an anti-drug song to coincide with the program.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the hook:\n\n\n\nD.A.R.E. to keep a kid off drugs. D.A.R.E. to keep a kid off dope.\n\nIt was not lit.\n\n\n\nIn any event, because I lived in an area that was classified as the \u201cinner city,\u201d let me tell you on an anecdotal level (\u2019cause I\u2019ve already linked y\u2019all to the site to various studies), that shit didn\u2019t work. People end up on drugs for various reasons, but trust and believe like peak Keyshia Cole that D.A.R.E.\u2019s psychological methodology\u2014Be scared!\u2014proved ineffective. It\u2019s pretty much on par with those who create the poor socioeconomic conditions that result in many people\u2014including those I went to school with\u2014turning to selling drugs as a means of support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of, that Keebler-elf-looking somebody also found the time at this conference to fault the drug policies of former President Barack Obama over his sentencing-reform policies, claiming that Obama directed prosecutors \u201cnot to charge the most serious offenses.\u201d Yes, because mass incarceration\u2014specifically themed around locking up millions over nonviolent offenses\u2014is cruel and unhelpful.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t tell him that, though. In his deluded mind\u2014which appears to not be able to compute any strategy that was not first conceived in black or white or near a burning cross\u2014trying to scare kids and sticking people who really just need greater opportunities in prisons is the way to go. Therein lies the ongoing problem with a smaller fraction of the country successfully electing a bigot into the White House with the help of an outdated Electoral College and the Russian government: He appoints other bigots like Jeff Sessions, who are nothing more than relics from the unsuccessful war on drugs.\n\n\n\nThe D.A.R.E. program, which was co-founded by the same former Los Angeles police chief who retired after his handling of the Rodney King riots, is an idea not worth revisiting. Only an attorney general who likens cannabis to heroin would think so. The sad part is that everyone deserves weed in order to deal with the anxiety that comes with living under this oppressive, dysfunctional and never-not-ridiculous administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, when asked to provide proof of the program\u2019s effectiveness, his spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n\n\nI D.A.R.E.

She even mentioned cyberbullying, which was a bit ironic, since her husband is often seen as one of the biggest cyberbullies of all time.\n\nThe full remarks of Trump\u2019s speech were transcribed by a writer from the San Diego Union-Tribune. At the beginning of her speech, she said:\n\nI would like to welcome and thank all of you for joining me here today. I\u2019m honored to serve as first lady of the United States and I look forward to sharing with each of you my sincere hopes for all that we will be able to do together to promote peace, human rights and human dignity, leaving no one behind, especially not our children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far so good, right?\n\nShe continued by saying that being a mother to her son, Barron, is the most important and joyous role she\u2019s ever had, and that loving, educating and bringing up the next generation to be happy, productive and morally responsible adults should be the essential focus in everyone\u2019s life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhether it is drug addiction, bullying, poverty, disease, trafficking, illiteracy or hunger, it is the children who are hit first and hardest in any country. And as we all know, the future of every nation rests with the promise of their young people,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd here is where we get to the part that makes you start to wonder what it\u2019s like at home with her, her husband and their young son:\n\nIf you look at the present state of children in any society, we will see the future that our world can expect tomorrow. Show me your civic lessons of today and I will show you your civic leaders of tomorrow. Show me your history lessons of today and I will show you your political leaders of tomorrow. Show me the loving bonds between your families today and I will show you the patriotism and moral clarity of your nation tomorrow. Our choices on how we raise and educate our children will in fact provide the blueprint for the next generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat lessons does she think her husband is teaching not only their young son but an entire nation of young people who see their president on social media and on television saying the first thing that pops into his head without any type of filter? How do the comments he made in his U.N. speech align with what she thinks the children of the world learn from the adults around them? Does she see any irony in this at all?\n\nShe continued:\n\nWe must remember that they are watching and listening so we must never miss an opportunity to teach life\u2019s many ethical lessons along the way. As adults we are not merely responsible. We are accountable. I hope you will join me in committing ourselves to teaching the next generation to live by and honor the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is my paramount in today\u2019s society and my focus as first lady.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sounds like a speech Melania Trump should have been giving to her husband at the dinner table, not to foreign dignitaries at the U.N. who have likely not shown their asses even a fraction as much as Donald Trump has. Is he responsible? Is he accountable? Is he living by and honoring the Golden Rule?\n\n\u201cIt remains our generation\u2019s moral imperative to take responsibility for what our children learn. We must turn our focus right now to the message and content they are exposed to on a daily basis through social media, the bullying, the experience online and in person, and the growing global epidemic of drug addiction and drug overdose,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not going to bother repeating myself. The words in bold are my emphasis, not hers or the Union-Tribune\u2019s. The irony is there, and it is making me constipated.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the exact wording, but there is an old saying about not sweeping around my front door when your house ain\u2019t clean, and that applies here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Melania Trump is truly concerned about the messaging and content that children are exposed to on a daily basis through social media, including bullying, she should start with cleaning up her husband\u2019s act first.\n\nRead more at the San Diego Union-Tribune.", "keywords": ["golden", "generation", "lessons", "husband", "unto", "tomorrow", "rule", "world", "trump", "live", "speech", "young", "today", "melania", "wants", "children"], "polarity": 0.17595834117573245, "subjectivity": 0.4471704623878535},

She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well.

Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["white", "shootings", "loesch", "town", "ratings", "gold", "media", "loves", "love", "mothers", "nra", "chicago", "spokeswoman", "shes", "gun", "mass"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["theories", "parkland", "fla", "used", "state", "douglas", "school", "shooting", "reform", "right", "seeking", "aide", "students", "survivors", "far", "gun", "stoneman"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

Nevertheless, I am going to talk to you even though I fear you vacated your body a long time ago. I believe you sent yourself away where no one could touch you. You went crazy first and now you exist in parts. You, dear Ben, are a man who once was. But being a woman of hope, I ask: can you walk a ways and see where your heart is? I imagine it used to beat with such vigor and passion, a magic heart.\n\nI believe you are dying a slow death in the shell of your skin, because what else could bring you to say enslaved human beings who were stacked atop each other with no room to move or breathe or relieve themselves, who were starved and whipped and raped, who were ripped from their husbands and wives and from their children\u2014many of whom died during the treacherous journey, their bones their only song now at the bottom of dead seas made holy now by their gleam\u2014were immigrants? They were enslaved, Ben. They were worked, often, to death, for nothing. That\u2019s call slavery, Ben. It went on for four centuries. Ben, did you know they were in chains? Ben, what immigrants be in chains? Ben, you sound so stupid, but unfortunately, you are not merely stupid. If you were merely stupid, this would not cause us such outrage. Ben, we knew a while ago that you had become\u2026different. Conservative. Ignorant. Bigoted. You didn\u2019t look or talk like the Ben who was once ours\u2014the way the Temptations are ours, the way Barack and Michelle are ours, the way Anita Baker is ours, the way Maxine Waters is ours, the way gospel and the blues are ours. But we weren\u2019t enough for you. Our love wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and neither was self-love. Even the best Uncle Toms can be said to have been bought. Oh, Ben. I do not believe anyone bought your soul; I believe you just gave it away. And you can\u2019t stand yourself no more. I might\u2019ve felt bad enough to weep for you, except you chose this.\n\nI don\u2019t know where your hands have been, even though I know what they used to be: beautiful, brilliant hands, soft as an angel\u2019s wing, doing God\u2019s mighty work. Ben, you think you doing God\u2019s work now? You ain\u2019t. No one loves you enough to tell you because everyone in your circle is still clinging to the Ben Carson you used to be in hopes that, maybe, you could return. But I sense no one is holding their breath on that. Your new, white friends must love all that you have become: a lonesome shell that is either silent or, when he speaks, deadly.\n\nThough I believe you are gone, gone, gone, I got to at least tell you about yourself. Ben, how many Black boys and girls wanted to be doctors and surgeons because of you? But look what you did yesterday: you made racist white people\u2014and even non-racist white people\u2014get off for slavery. Yeah, you did that. I know it can\u2019t sting you just right because you deadened yourself a while back. Nevertheless. You made them believe we wanted that torture and terror. Ben, do you realize you made them believe it was okay to steal us from our first homes? That somehow, slavery was part of our striving? Ben, do you know you told them we wanted that? That we believe it was all worth it for the American Dream, which for many of us, remains a trick? Ben, your hands dirty. They ain\u2019t just dirty, though, Ben. Your hands bloody. Your hands bloody with Black blood. You put bodies on those ships yesterday. You put chains on little children. You said \u201cimmigrants\u201d as if we chose. As if that could even be possible. If you were only stupid, Ben. But no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s sad that you have chosen to be comatose because they were jealous and couldn\u2019t take your Black genius, how you understood the brain\u2014back then\u2014 the way Morrison understands language or the way Miles knew his horn. Ben, you are probably struggling with whom I mean when I say they. I mean white people. I see you shaking your head at that Ben, but they were lesser than you because they couldn\u2019t stand all the genius you were. They hated the way your mind outmaneuvered theirs. Oh, Ben. I can only imagine the landmines of micro and macro aggressions you withstood, on the regular. You were a beautiful brown tree, and they were a hurricane. A fist formed to pound you. I can only imagine the word \u201cnigger\u201d on repeat and all the countless, creative ways they called you that, day in and day out. After all, their greatest creativity is their brutality. The more creative your genius became, the more they reviled you. The more rootless you felt. You let it sink into the bone, how much they hated you. You let them wear you out. Their whiteness haunted you. Their whiteness said you ain\u2019t shit, and you believed them because you wanted their love.\n\nWhy was our love not enough? Did we not hold you up? Did we not whisper your name at Sunday dinners? Did we not pray for God to keep working through your hands? Did we not know your name like we know Dr. King\u2019s? Oh, Ben. Our love is the best love, baby. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t know that when it mattered, back when your soul was in its place, back when your heart beat on time. Your hands used to do magic work. Oh, Lord, your beautiful hands! Now they don\u2019t have no witness to speak of. They just fold in your lap. I can almost hear them: Well, Lord. We tried.\n\nBen\u2026what happened to Ben Carson?\n\nI know he gone. But do you know where you put him? Did you drown him where they drowned Emmett? Was he shot in his driveway like Medgar? Was he bombed on Christmas Eve? Did you lock him in a cell and throw away the key? Did you cut out his tongue when you took away his heart and his soul? Can you count the lives you touched? Then broke? Does Ben know that number?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t even dream anymore.\n\nBen, I have always believed Baby Suggs, holy, of Morrison\u2019s Beloved when she said, \u201cThere is no bad luck in the world but whitefolks. They don\u2019t know when to stop.\u201d Then she died. I thought that was the end-all. But you have bested even her. There ain\u2019t no bad luck in the world, I offer as revision, but a Black man who hates himself. Because that man can do no good. All he can do is make the folks who once loved him wonder if it was a phantom all that time. You made the descendants of the so-called masters feel like they were doing us a favor. Four hundred years of \u201cgood looking out.\u201d Oh, Ben. How you disappoint.\n\nYou need to know you should stop talking. I believe silence is golden right now while you go out there and find your real tongue\u2014the tongue that used to raise people from what would have been a certain death without first your tongue declaring what you were about to do, then your hands doing that magic on operating tables. Lord, how you used to shine in that operating room. How you used to shine everywhere. Don\u2019t you miss your shine? Do you remember how it felt to glow? Naw. I don\u2019t imagine you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen, I can\u2019t stand you no more or the sound of your voice. I remember who you were, though. Part of why we\u2019re out here dragging you for life is not just because you deserve it, but because your mouth is an open wound, and you hurt us with your lies yesterday. We bear the memory of what you used to mean to us. Once, I would have loved to introduce my son to you. That time has passed. I\u2019d believe you might have a chance to come back if it wasn\u2019t for your eyes. They are such lifeless, dead things.\n\nYou still got breath, from what it looks like. You have to have breath to be talking, even though you should stop. Can you use your breath as a starting point? I\u2019d hoped you might\u2019ve left your soul someplace where you can go back for it. But yesterday, you snatched pretty much all hope of that. Still and all. I write to you. Maybe something inside of you is still alive. You owe us an apology, you sad, sad shell of what used to be a man worthy of our esteem, our respect, our devotion, and our love. Now, all we got for you is shade. And scorch. Even if you uttered sorry, all we would hear is lifeless noise. So. Keep it.\n\nBut this:\n\nBen, put your eyes back in. See what you did to yourself. Amidst a sea of brown love that washed over you, back then, as a prayer, you waded out into deep water and went under. Now you work for a spoiled, hateful, incompetent soul. You salute to him.

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim.

During a speech Thursday at a sheriffs\u2019 convention in Washington, D.C., Sessions found a way to bring up criminal records and gang violence while addressing Wednesday\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think effective enforcement of our gun laws, focusing on criminals and dangerous people, mentally ill people that have been\u2014where we have the legal ability to do so\u2014can reduce violence in our communities and improve public safety,\u201d Sessions said, ThinkProgress reports. \u201cIt is not good if we got gun laws that say criminals can\u2019t carry guns and they never get enforced. So we intend to enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone might want to let Sessions know that Nikolas Cruz, the accused gunman in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting, purchased his gun legally, which proves that current gun laws might be ineffective.\n\nBut Sessions wouldn\u2019t be Sessions if he didn\u2019t find a way to bring up gang violence\u2014which, unless Sessions is talking about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gang, which Cruz appeared to belong to, really has no place in this discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen parents once again go to sleep fearful that their kids will not be safe, even when they go to school\u2014parents have told me in gang-infested neighborhoods that children can no longer stand at the bus stop by themselves\u2014they take turns, parents do, of being out there every morning and afternoon,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve gotta confront the problem. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter to Sessions that Parkland is not a place terrorized by gang violence.

If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["way", "gang", "violence", "parkland", "florida", "nonsensical", "whistles", "symphony", "school", "racist", "shooting", "sessions", "jeff", "laws", "speech", "know", "gun", "think"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

I think the point that the dictator in chief has forgotten is that when it comes to the presidency, the press does the work of the people. Its members are the ones who hold court with the president and his staff. They are the ones who have daily contact with the administration and can ask the questions the rest of us want answered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould the Washington Post have broken this story without being involved in an all-out war with the president? Surely. But I know this: When you come for the press, the press will come for you. You don\u2019t get to lob accusations and claim that reporting is false and fabricated and not deal with the repercussions.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it\u2014Sessions is a direct result of reporters\u2019 willingness to work a little harder and stay a little later because of the president\u2019s claims against them. The Post holds one distinction that no other paper in the country has: It has brought down a president. And it can smell blood in the water with this administration.\n\nThis Sessions mess isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, and just know this: Sessions didn\u2019t just meet with some random Russian dude; he met with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador whom U.S. intelligence considers to be one of Russia\u2019s top spies and spy recruiters, according to CNN.

I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["guns", "white", "war", "believe", "members", "theres", "black", "money", "nras", "control", "stop", "theory", "ownership", "right", "nra", "kids", "buy", "gun", "wont"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

Rybka was recently arrested and thrown into a Thai jail and now, most likely because she\u2019s been arrested and cut off from her Russian money source, she\u2019s ready to spill all the tea.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am ready to tell you about all those jigsaw puzzles you were missing, to support it with audio, video, regarding the connection between our \u2018dear\u2019 parliament members with [former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort, Trump and all this \u2018buzz\u2019 around the election in the USA,\u201d said Rybka, who appeared to be riding around in a caged vehicle, USA Today reports. \u201cI know a lot. Therefore, I shall wait for your offers, and I wait in the Thai prison.\u201d\n\nWait, I\u2019m completely confused. Rybka is locked up in a Thai prison and is riding around in a caged vehicle, most likely a prison-transport vehicle, but she still has her phone and access to her Instagram account?\n\nAlso, instead of asking for help, she\u2019s offering to sell her story to whomever can get her out of prison. If it weren\u2019t for this divisive administration and this backward-ass president, I would chalk up Rybka\u2019s missive as the desperate pleas of a Russian thot, but I hate this administration so much I am tempted to start a GoFundMe account in her honor. Oh, and then there is this:\n\n\u201cIf we go back to Russia we will die in Russian\u2019s prison or they will kill us,\u201d she wrote Tuesday on her Instagram account. \u201cPlease USA help us not to die from Russians!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRybka was arrested along with nine other Russians who claimed to be sex experts running a course on lovemaking, which I guess is illegal in Thailand.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Deripaska was a business associate of former Trump campaign manager Manafort and hired him starting in 2006 to influence American politics to benefit Russia. The contract stipulated $10 million a year for Manafort\u2019s services.\n\nWhile Rybka could potentially have the goods to sink this torturous administration\u2019s bootleg dingy, Rybka also admits to making shit up from time to time, USA Today reports. But she has provided receipts to back up part of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how USA Today recounts bits of her memoir, Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, in which she writes about galavanting with top Russian officials, a tome that\u2019s been cited by Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and critic of President Vladimir Putin:\n\nNavalny used Rybka\u2019s memoir Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, her social media postings and geolocation techniques to show that she spent time in August 2016 on Deripaska\u2019s yacht off the coast of Norway. She had claimed in her book that the cruise was off the coast of Greenland. Photos on her Instagram account, @natya_rybka.ru, showed her on the navy blue, teak-decked Elden with Deripaska. They also showed Deripaska there with Sergei Prikhodko, who\u2019s described on the Russian government\u2019s website as deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeripaska posted a statement to Instagram on Feb. 9 claiming that he\u2019s never done anything wrong and plans to defend his \u201chonor and dignity\u201d in court. Prikhodko also suggested to the Russian newspaper RBK Daily that he would like to fight Navalny, but promised to \u201cremain within the legal framework,\u201d USA Today reports.\n\n\n\nSo who\u2019s going to spring to get the Russian call girl out of Thai jail? Do the Bernie bros want in on this? I\u2019m ready to hear what else she\u2019s got to say, and even if it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s an exciting lie, not like the ones this third-grade administration tells.", "keywords": ["breaks", "presidents", "vehicle", "straw", "instagram", "joe", "russian", "trump", "today", "camelcolored", "usa", "shes", "rybka", "thai", "girl", "deripaska"], "polarity": -0.007993197278911564, "subjectivity": 0.30238095238095236},

A benefit that we\u2014those of us who didn\u2019t vote for Trump\u2014have is that because he wears his emotions, as well as his presidential number, on his sleeve\u2014we see you, 45!\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday the president finished up his morning ritual of burning Barack Obama photos and slathering pig blood across his stomach before tweeting quotes from Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s favorite news network:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ended his tweet storm with an obnoxious all-caps tweet like only this president can:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does all of this prove? That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps? Could it have something to do with Trump\u2019s fake daughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks is set to met with members of the House Intelligence Committee, CNN reports. In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election. Yes, there are multiple investigations into possible Russia collusion because, well, Russia colluded.\n\nHicks served as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 before moving into her new role. Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning. I assume that he tweeted this right before his morning ritual of sacrificing a baby goat and poking pins in his stuffed Obama doll.\n\n#StayWoke.", "keywords": ["heating", "latest", "president", "trumps", "morning", "pleaded", "guilty", "russian", "investigation", "trump", "russia", "election", "proves"], "polarity": -0.010199283475145537, "subjectivity": 0.47683982683982684},

Even with multiple states legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. attorney general has made it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws.\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court. A federal lawsuit filed against Sessions and the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York City in July hit the docket Wednesday, the New York Times reports, and now both sides will have the opportunity to present their case before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case include former NFL player Marvin Washington, who says his business interests in states where marijuana is legal are being impeded by the Controlled Substances Act. Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry. It claims that the Controlled Substances Act has been used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph A. Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit, told the Times: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has stood up to the government to be able to use it. It\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also points out blatant hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government when it comes to marijuana. While the government claims that pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003 to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing: \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too. If you only decided case law based upon what people thought years before, we would never have Brown v. Board of Education. \u2026 We would never have Windsor. We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality.\u201d\n\nJudge Hellerstein openly admitted in court that marijuana does not meet one of the three requirements for Schedule I drug status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,\u201d Hellerstein said to Hiller during the hearing. \u201cI have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true. How could anyone say that your clients\u2019 lives have not been saved by marijuana? How can anyone say that your clients\u2019 pain and suffering has not been alleviated by marijuana? You can\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\nBut Hellerstein also questioned whether the DOJ\u2019s decision should be challenged in district court.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of things district judges have to do,\u201d Hellerstein said. \u201cWhen agencies are set up to do the very kind of thing that you want me to do, I think the right thing is to defer to the agency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHellerstein did, however, delay making a decision on the government\u2019s request to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to consider the issues over the next several days or weeks until he comes to a conclusion,\u201d Hiller said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the judge allows the suit to move forward, because making marijuana a Schedule I drug is one of the more ridiculous moves our government has made.", "keywords": ["clients", "hellerstein", "claims", "act", "court", "law", "federal", "case", "battle", "drug", "sessions", "vs", "jeff", "young", "hiller", "marijuana", "begins"], "polarity": 0.07758658008658008, "subjectivity": 0.3954274891774892},

And now, on Monday, in a huge reversal, the Justice Department under the Trump administration has decided to drop the department\u2019s position that Republican state lawmakers pushed Texas\u2019 strict voter-ID law to make it harder for people of color to vote.\n\n\n\nAs Talking Points Memo notes, for the past six years, the DOJ has sided with citizens and civil rights groups fighting against the stringent voter-ID law, which required voters to show one of seven approved forms of identification in order to cast their ballot.\n\nThe law, which was enacted in 2011, has been at the center of court battles ever since, with civil rights groups arguing that the policy discriminates against low-income and minority voters. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals further blocked the state from fully enforcing the law for the 2016 presidential election, a decision that cleared the way for more than 16,000 Texans to vote.\n\nHowever, on Monday, that all changed.

Just when you think that the allegations coming from one of the most revered and respected adobes worldwide can\u2019t get any worse, the entire White House\u2014staff, administration, housekeeping\u2014is like, \u201cHold my folders.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the White House was rocked by allegations that Staff Secretary Rob Porter abused two of his ex-wives. The rumors were supported by photos showing one of Porter\u2019s ex-wives with a black eye. Now several sources are reporting that the White House was fully aware of claims that Porter was a serial abuser and not only hired him but also allowed him to continue an untrammeled rise within the administration\u2014including dating Trump\u2019s fake daughter, Hope Hicks, to whom the president affectionately creepily refers as \u201cHopie\u201d and \u201cHopester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, the president knew for months that Porter had been accused of domestic abuse, and even after Tuesday\u2019s bombshell report by the Daily Mail, which included claims that Porter was both verbally and physically abusive to his ex-wives, the White House was still scrambling to keep him on staff.\n\nPorter denied the allegations but resigned Wednesday. The White House, however, announced shortly after his resignation that Porter wouldn\u2019t be leaving the White House immediately, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,\u201d Porter said in a statement provided by the White House, Axios reports. \u201cMy commitment to public service speaks for itself. I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question, why is the White House working so hard to keep Porter on staff? Well, I can\u2019t make this any plainer: Porter is dating Hopie! Hopie is not only the president\u2019s fake daughter (totally normal for this president to have a fake daughter; seriously, there is nothing to see here) but is also considered a member of the untouchable staff, which includes the president\u2019s actual family. CNN notes that before Porter resigned, Hopie, who serves as the White House communications director, helped draft a supportive statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him,\u201d the statement from Kelly reads, CNN reports.\n\nKelly now notes that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the allegations against Porter but stands by his initial statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, get this, CNN notes that the claims against Porter were found during a routine background check by the FBI a year ago. So Porter worked at the White House for a year, worked very closely with the president and his chief of staff, but didn\u2019t have security clearance? Where they do that at?\n\nClearly, President \u201cGrab \u2019em by the Pussy\u201d is no feminist. Hell, he told the repugnantly smug Piers Morgan as much during a recent interview. He\u2019s never been a champion of women\u2019s rights, yet 53 percent of white women voted against their self-interests to put him in office.\n\nThis president is trash, and clearly everyone around him is such. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that the president is flying by the seat of his pants and wearing his KFC bucket on his head because he has no clue what he\u2019s doing in the White House and doesn\u2019t care whom he offends. Porter shouldn\u2019t have needed to resign because he never should have been hired! But they knew that and did it anyway because, well ...

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) seems to prefer that you not refer to him as a \u201chouse Negro.\u201d Or as an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d Likewise, Scott does not care for the insinuation that his conservative leanings equate to a complete condemnation of his own community. The lone black Republican member of the U.S. Senate conveyed such sentiments while delivering a 30-minute speech in defense of his support of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III for U.S. attorney general.\n\n\n\nAs Scott stood on the Senate floor, he read various forms of criticism that had been leveled at him across social media: \u201c\u2018You are an Uncle Tom, Scott. You\u2019re for Sessions. How does a black man turn on his own.\u2019\u201d And: \u201c\u2018Tim Scott ... doesn\u2019t have a shred of honor. He\u2019s a house Negro like the one in Django.\u2019\u201d\n\nScott went on to add, \u201cI left out all the ones that used the n-word. Just felt like that would not be appropriate.\u201d\n\nActually, he should have said it because that\u2019s what his party has been calling his people for the last 50 years in one form or another as part of its Southern strategy. As a son of South Carolina, Scott ought to be quite familiar with the ways that many white men like Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III have employed such tactics in terms of both policy and rhetoric.\n\nStill, some Republicans and even Democrats found themselves impressed with Scott\u2019s performance; others know better. Is the name-calling helpful? Probably not. Is it wrong to generalize all black Republicans? It\u2019s typically foolish to generalize, no matter the target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, it is not wrong to ask Scott why he would give a man who has been accused of bigotry for a substantial portion of his life control of the Justice Department.\n\nThe most frustrating portion of Scott\u2019s remarks, though, was the following: \u201cI just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative Americans.\u201d\n\nSen. Scott, you\u2019ve got to shut your black ass up. This is why black Republicans bewilder me. In theory, one can understand those who align with a political ideology that believes in smaller government and free enterprise on principle. As a contractor, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge that every single tax season, I morph into Ted Cruz with melanin and a spine and toy with the notion of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet although the Democratic Party has plenty of issues with racism within its own ranks in terms of both policy and not valuing enough the black voters whose support has thwarted its extinction, there are certain levels to which the donkeys would never stoop.\n\nDemocrats of today would not nominate a cantaloupe-colored bigoted charlatan with no experience in government as president. Nor would they go along with that same con man\u2019s plans to nominate as attorney general in 2017 a man who was deemed too racist in the 1980s to be a federal judge.\n\nSure, Democrats can\u2019t, given that their base is far more inclusive, but the GOP doesn\u2019t have to be committed to the preservation of white, heterosexual male power. Republicans want that as their nucleus, and anyone who aligns him- or herself with that is a co-conspirator. Such is his or her right, though it is not an act of principle but of self-interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Scott wants to present nobility for the immoral act of lending support to a kakistocracy populated by a bevy of bigots.\n\nTo let Scott tell it, though: \u201cHe is not a racist. Jeff Sessions has earned my support. And I will hold him accountable if and when we disagree.\u201d\n\nThis is the same person who said, \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he could support Sunkist Stalin when he was still a candidate after Scott\u2019s initial pick, \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d dropped out. A black man who, yes, has discussed his own experiences with racism in law enforcement, yet has still defended \u201claw and order\u201d on national television. One who, after characterizing some of Sunkist Stalin\u2019s statements as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201cracially toxic,\u201d not only said that he would vote for him, but after his win, also argued that we should all give him a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who bends that low to assist anyone that vile will not suddenly rise to speak on what\u2019s right. To wit, days before defending Sessions, he spoke on behalf of Betsy DeVos. No, she cannot single-handedly destroy public education, as he noted in a series of tweets, but she can do plenty of damage all the same. DeVos has aggressively proved herself unqualified for the job, but she gave Scott money in the past. Problem solved.\n\nAlready, Sessions is speaking of massive waves of crime and continuing on with the anti-immigrant rhetoric that he\u2019s long been known for. These are not dog whistles; they are screams of intent.\n\nSessions will weaponize the Justice Department and make it harder for blacks and Latinos to safely walk the streets without fear of police persecution; he will make it harder for black people to vote; he will bring hell to all immigrants regardless of hue. He will be the menace he was selected to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott can profess to know Sessions\u2019 heart. He can pretend that whatever meetings he scheduled between Sessions and black church leaders matter all he likes. The reality remains: He sold out his people and, by extension, all marginalized people.\n\nPerhaps Tim Scott doesn\u2019t like the names he\u2019s been called as a result of his choices, but nasty names have nothing on the harsh consequences that await so many of the rest of us. Who cares about his hurt feelings? The rest of us have to worry about real pain now.", "keywords": ["doesnt", "ol", "man", "republicans", "scotts", "good", "tim", "hes", "sessions", "live", "names", "support", "called", "scott", "voting", "black"], "polarity": 0.05550595238095238, "subjectivity": 0.45356620718462826},

How do you host an Easter-egg hunt and not have enough eggs? Bruh, you had one job!

Trump seems to have a crowd-size problem, but I\u2019m sure that, as with the inauguration, Trump will call it \u201cfake news\u201d or say it was because so many children rolled their Easter eggs online. Press secretary Sean Spicer claims it was intentional because Melania Trump wanted to focus on the traditional aspects. I think the White House staff failed to explain to Melania that no one ordered Chinese food. She probably thought she was having a bunch of people over for egg rolls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy personal theory is that people knew the potato salad wouldn\u2019t be any good.\n\n1. Trump forgot what to do during the national anthem: Melania had to nudge the bronzed bomber to remind him to put his hand over his heart during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Or maybe he was channeling his inner Colin Kaepernick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the day was mostly a travesty, there were some good moments. Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Melania Trump and others read children\u2019s books to the kids.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["terrorist", "second", "nras", "organization", "legal", "right", "deaths", "nra", "dont", "gun", "directly"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin. It is a stain on all our hands.

According to the Daily Breeze, Terrell was in deep with a predominantly black South Los Angeles gang in a community that is more than 95 percent white and Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is not suspected of firing the fatal shot that took Holmes\u2019 life; he is believed to be the driver who helped the gunmen get away. Despite this, he does face some serious charges, including some based on allegations that he committed the act to help out his gang. A conviction on these charges could get him anything from 25 years to life.\n\nThat being said, despite the hefty and serious charges, Terrell posted bail by Oct. 19 and was scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 29. In the meantime, he is still living his best life as if nothing happened. A Facebook photograph showed him enjoying a World Series game at Dodger Stadium with his affluent parents, with whom he often enjoys trips to Mexican resorts and the other fine things in life, according to the Breeze.\n\nThe Breeze notes that Terrell\u2019s father, Donald Wayne Terrell, is president of the media consulting firm New & Improved Media in El Segundo, Calif., while his mother is a South Bay interior designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerrell also apparently remains in school, which has created more than a buzz among parents. Nonetheless, Palos Verdes Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin said that officials were aware of the charges this young thug faces, declaring that \u201cvigilance is high.\u201d\n\nHowever, Austin did not confirm Terrell\u2019s status at school, saying only very generally that students have the right to a public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very clear exclusion criteria that have to occur before a student was not allowed to attend a public school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor a school suspension of any kind, there has to be a direct nexus to the school itself,\u201d Austin added. \u201cThese allegations have no nexus to our school. The allegations and charges against a student without a nexus to school would not be grounds for exclusion.\u201d\n\nThe charges against this wannabe thug stem from the shooting of Holmes on Oct. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Holmes and two other friends were confronted by two armed individuals who asked where they were from. One armed thug fired several shots, hitting Holmes, while his friends managed to run away.\n\nThe shooter and an accomplice ran back to a black car that drove away. Holmes was rushed to the hospital but couldn\u2019t be saved.\n\nPolice say that Holmes and his friends were not linked to any gang activity.\n\nTwo other suspects are currently in custody on suspicion of murder; however, both are under 18 and are currently being held in a juvenile facility.

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim.

Perhaps, like most of us, she assumed that her narcissistic nitwit of a husband was merely bullshitting, but there was always the risk that he would actually go through with a real foray into presidential politics.\n\nSo when it comes to the question of whether or not she deserves pity, ask yourself another question first: Why bother?\n\nOver the weekend, Melania looked noticeably uncomfortable at every event associated with her husband\u2019s inauguration.

On the pair\u2019s awkward, rhythm-challenged inaugural dance, body-language expert and professional speaker Patti Wood noted to Mic that Melania leaned away from her husband, Parmesan Putin.\n\n\u201cThat typically says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to merge with you as a partner,\u2019\u201d Wood explained, adding that Tangerine was \u201cpulling her in sexually.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the leader of the Aryan version of Love & Hip Hop: New York\u2019s Creep Squad behaved exactly the way you\u2019d expect\u2014to Melania\u2019s apparent horror. That, coupled with a GIF of a visibly bothered Melania, has sparked cries of \u201cFree Melania.\u201d No matter how well intentioned these efforts, there are ample reasons to scream up \u201cHell nah\u201d in response.\n\nEven when feeling somewhat bad for her, I always kept in the back pocket of my mind that she willfully chose to marry a racist, sexist jackass dedicated to the hobby of being disrespectful. As we move forward with this shit show of an administration, it\u2019s time for all of us to keep such a tidbit front and center. We should also recall that when it comes to bigotry, Melania was an active participant in the very racist conspiracy theory that fueled her husband\u2019s political rise.\n\nNearly six years ago, Melania appeared on Joy Behar\u2019s HLN show and used her status as an immigrant to lend credence to the idea that President Barack Obama needed to show his papers to prove he\u2019s a U.S. citizen. As fate would have it, last year it was reported that Melania worked as a model without a proper visa. The Trump campaign promised a press conference featuring Melania to address the matter, but as with Parmesan Putin\u2019s tax returns, we never saw it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd on that very appearance on Behar\u2019s show, Melania touted many of the talking points (he\u2019s a brilliant businessman, negotiator and straight shooter) that would guide her husband\u2019s presidential campaign. One imagines that she might have told him in private, \u201cI was just playing, you orange bitch; don\u2019t do this to me!\u201d but it\u2019s still all her fault for leaving traces of her lipstick on his nonsense.\n\nIf her facial expressions are any indication, the next four years (or however long he lasts) will be painful. Still, there\u2019s only so much sympathy one can have for a wealthy white woman who had no problem going on national television to help her boneheaded, racist husband achieve his goal of delegitimizing the first black president of the United States to cement himself as a political force. Let\u2019s just say that if \u201cso much sympathy\u201d could be converted into currency, it would amount to a single peso.\n\nY\u2019all want to free Melania?

Therefore, I shall wait for your offers, and I wait in the Thai prison.\u201d\n\nWait, I\u2019m completely confused. Rybka is locked up in a Thai prison and is riding around in a caged vehicle, most likely a prison-transport vehicle, but she still has her phone and access to her Instagram account?\n\nAlso, instead of asking for help, she\u2019s offering to sell her story to whomever can get her out of prison. If it weren\u2019t for this divisive administration and this backward-ass president, I would chalk up Rybka\u2019s missive as the desperate pleas of a Russian thot, but I hate this administration so much I am tempted to start a GoFundMe account in her honor. Oh, and then there is this:\n\n\u201cIf we go back to Russia we will die in Russian\u2019s prison or they will kill us,\u201d she wrote Tuesday on her Instagram account. \u201cPlease USA help us not to die from Russians!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRybka was arrested along with nine other Russians who claimed to be sex experts running a course on lovemaking, which I guess is illegal in Thailand.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Deripaska was a business associate of former Trump campaign manager Manafort and hired him starting in 2006 to influence American politics to benefit Russia. The contract stipulated $10 million a year for Manafort\u2019s services.\n\nWhile Rybka could potentially have the goods to sink this torturous administration\u2019s bootleg dingy, Rybka also admits to making shit up from time to time, USA Today reports. But she has provided receipts to back up part of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how USA Today recounts bits of her memoir, Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, in which she writes about galavanting with top Russian officials, a tome that\u2019s been cited by Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and critic of President Vladimir Putin:\n\nNavalny used Rybka\u2019s memoir Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire?, her social media postings and geolocation techniques to show that she spent time in August 2016 on Deripaska\u2019s yacht off the coast of Norway. She had claimed in her book that the cruise was off the coast of Greenland. Photos on her Instagram account, @natya_rybka.ru, showed her on the navy blue, teak-decked Elden with Deripaska.

Sadly, though, this is America and the White House is run by one of the most evil characters ever known to man: White Satan.\n\n\n\nWhite Satan does not care about domestic violence charges, unless domestic violence charges were connected to, say, a Latino-and-African-American football player who kneels during the national anthem; then the president would really care about domestic violence issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow reports are emerging that Rob Porter, the disgraced former White House secretary who handled classified documents although he never had security clearance, was lobbying for a higher position in Trump\u2019s administration at the time he abruptly resigned.\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN explains the White House\u2019s love affair with Porter:\n\nHis anticipated elevation further highlights how top White House officials were willing to overlook indications from the FBI that there were potential abuse allegations in his background in exchange for professional competence in a tumultuous West Wing. Porter had been actively lobbying to take on new policy portfolios outside the traditional scope of the staff secretary, one person familiar with the matter said, which included speechwriting duties and a role in planning policy rollouts. Neither of those tasks is traditionally carried out by the staff secretary. One of the areas Porter was set to delve further into was trade policy, according to the person. Porter was a regular attendee at a weekly trade meeting among top-level administration officials. He was also being considered for the deputy chief of staff position, another source familiar with the situation said. CNN reported Friday that Jim Carroll, who served as the deputy chief of staff for less than three months, was stepping down to helm the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Several White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were receptive to promoting Porter. Kelly had told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential. CNN has reported that Kelly was aware for months of the potential that Porter\u2019s ex-wives could present damaging information on him. Kelly \u201cdefinitely wanted to expand his role,\u201d a source familiar tells CNN.\n\nIf only there were a group of superhuman women who could have stopped White Satan from getting into a office. A powerful group of women who donned magical pink pussy hats and who marched in force. If only those women had a candidate who spoke to their issues and rallied behind their causes, maybe the world would be in better shape and we wouldn\u2019t know Rob Porter as anything other than the scum he is accused of being.

All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

Obama is thoughtful, he waits for Michelle before he walks up the steps of their new home to greet then-President George W. Bush. In contrast, Donald Trump greets the Obamas without his wife and she hurries to make her way up the stairs alone, accompanied into the house by the Obamas who are more considerate\u2014more respectful\u2014than her own husband.\n\nThe images, particularly the comparison to President Obama, reinforce a narrative that is easy enough to believe (likely because it\u2019s true): that Obama is a better man than Trump and thus treats women accordingly. The Obamas, in turn, express their sympathy for Melania, a poor woman married to a tyrant, by showing their graciousness, a hallmark of the Obama White House, actions that speak volumes about their humanity and morality. Here, Melania is a victim of her husband\u2019s brutishness; she is passive and silent, has no political opinions but instead is a sort of tabula rasa for America\u2019s women, on which her treatment is proof of President Trump\u2019s innate misogyny. President Trump\u2019s casual misuse of his wife is a domestic tragedy with national implications. But that narrative only works if, in fact, you believe that Melania is a blank slate or, at least, a woman simply acted on rather than a woman actively collaborating with her husband\u2019s ideologies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the past is any indication, Melania is no passive victim. Recently a 2011 interview with Melania on the Joy Behar Show went viral on Twitter. In the interview, Melania defends her husband\u2019s adamant commitment to the birther conspiracy born of the Tea Party\u2014his belief that President Obama is not an American citizen, that he was born in Kenya and that his Hawaii-issued birth certificate was, in fact, a forgery. \u201cDo you want to see President Obama\u2019s birth certificate or not?\u201d Melania asks Behar. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Behar responds. \u201cIt\u2019s not a birth certificate,\u201d Melania says as she shakes her head. Here, Melania recites her husband\u2019s conspiratorial and fictitious claims, ones Donald Trump repeated for five years until, in September 2016, he \u201cconceded\u201d that they were untrue. Melania has never indicated whether or not she agrees with that concession.\n\n\n\nBut Melania has always been willing to defend her husband and to employ tactics that typify the Trump approach to the world. After journalist Julia Ioffe published a profile of Melania in GQ, Melania denounced the piece, calling it \u201cyet another example of the dishonest media and their disingenuous reporting.\u201d When Ioffe received a barrage of anti-Semitic messages and threats, Melania said, that Ioffe \u201cprovoked them.\u201d Later, Melania almost trollishly announced that, as First Lady, she would launch a campaign to prevent bullying on the internet, denouncing social media\u2019s \u201cmean and rough\u201d culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media aside, she\u2019s proven that she\u2019s a willing scribe of the Trump hagiography. In October, Melania sat down with CNN to defend her husband after a leaked tape caught her husband bragging about sexually assaulting women. She called his language \u201cboy talk\u201d and blamed the tape\u2019s release on the conspiratorial \u201cleft-wing media.\u201d When asked about the sizable number of women who have accused her husband of sexual assault, she demonstrated that she was no listless vessel, but in full possession of autonomy: \u201cI know he respects women but he is defending himself because they are all lies,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nLike Ivanka Trump, whose brand and subsequent media narratives have worked to distance her from her father\u2019s repugnant ideologies from racist birtherism to sexual assault, Melania is no innocent. She\u2019s willing to vocally defend her husband\u2014not only to stand next to him for the sake of political spectacle or personal gain, but to do the obligatory media tours and, like her step-daughter, insist that he respects women.\n\nMelania Trump is hardly a stand-in for American women, she is neither a victim nor is she lacking agency. Rather she\u2019s an active participant working to construct Donald Trump\u2019s narrative, readily available to put a gauzy domestic veil on his racism and misogyny. Melania Trump doesn\u2019t deserve your sympathy.\n\n", "keywords": ["doesnt", "president", "husbands", "husband", "media", "women", "deserve", "trump", "shes", "melania", "obama", "obamas", "sympathy"], "polarity": 0.05454357002864466, "subjectivity": 0.40836267795223014},

(Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns. Senators and members of the House who aren\u2019t lackeys of the terrorist organization called the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the most effective weapon against a bad guy with a gun is the one thing we all seem to lack:\n\nCommon sense.", "keywords": ["guns", "shootings", "idiotic", "control", "bad", "argument", "nonsense", "guy", "number", "laws", "weapons", "states", "commonsense", "broken", "gun", "mass"], "polarity": 0.025412310435895345, "subjectivity": 0.5370657382449834},

Hip-hop made the leap, R&B was blessed with several noteworthy groups that provided classic albums, and neo-soul showed up and made superstars out of folks like Erykah Badu and D\u2019Angelo.\n\nNew jack swing took a step out of the arena but gave way to artists with hip-hop and R&B sensibilities, creating party anthems with boom bap and harmony from groups like SWV, Mary J. Blige and BBD. Black movie soundtracks and hoods across America could be heard knocking to Blige\u2019s \u201cReal Love\u201d in their Jeeps alongside Redman\u2019s \u201cTime 4 Sum Aksion\u201d and Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cLet Me Ride.\u201d\n\nWell, 1995 brought us one of the seminal offerings in hip-hop/R&B perfection: Groove Theory\u2019s \u201cTell Me,\u201d from their self-titled (and only) album. For my money, \u201cTell Me\u201d is one of the most \u201990s songs that ever did \u201990. Groove Theory was a duo featuring Mantronix\u2019s Bryce Wilson and the woman whose voice could save the world and who instantly became #Bae for thousands, Amel Larrieux. With Bryce\u2019s production and Amel\u2019s vocals and writing, \u201cTell Me\u201d showed up and had everybody hitting the same ol\u2019 two-step for the culture.\n\nWhy is the song perfect? Glad you asked. Let\u2019s start with the production. Wilson used a simple drum pattern, threw in some \u201cChristmas bells\u201d and added the bass line from the Mary Jane Girls\u2019 \u201cAll Night Long\u201d (hence the Rick James writing credit), which he chopped up a bit. The beat itself is super early to mid-\u201990s in its simplicity. Wilson adds some keyboard flourishes, but there isn\u2019t much to the beat at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s fine, because the real power of the song lies in the simple songwriting and Amel\u2019s powerhouse vocals, which are embellished with Trey Lorenz\u2019s additional vocals throughout to provide some tension. She demonstrates quite a bit of vocal range and even does a run to start the song, but largely, her voice is so buttery and beautiful and perfect over the boom-bap drumming that she has all the room she needs to let the singing breathe. While the lyrics aren\u2019t exactly changing the world\u2014it\u2019s a song about a crush\u2014they\u2019re very effective, especially the \u00fcber-repeatable hook. I mean, who hasn\u2019t been there? I\u2019ve been there.\n\nAmel sells the song with tremendous aplomb; \u201cTell Me\u201d IMMEDIATELY takes you back to the \u201990s. Nobody who was into the black-music scene during that time can hear that song without immediately remembering how the \u201990s felt. You might not remember where you were or what you were doing when you first heard it, but you remember the feel. Any song with that kind of power is nothing short of a perfect moment in black-music history. It gives you life. It takes you back to your youth and your crushes, the \u201990s style and the possibilities of it all.\n\nThe video was helmed by \u201990s staple director Hype Williams, which means that the label felt that they had a hit on their hands. The song ended up reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and as high as No. 2 on various other Billboard charts. It\u2019s a performance video with lots of shots of Amel and Bryce, though we all focused on Amel. Oddly, even the album cover faded Bryce into the background. I think we can safely call that shade and possibly foreshadowing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf ever I feel any bit of nostalgia or desire to relive the \u201990s, I almost always start with \u201cTell Me.\u201d It never lets me down.

The rumors were supported by photos showing one of Porter\u2019s ex-wives with a black eye. Now several sources are reporting that the White House was fully aware of claims that Porter was a serial abuser and not only hired him but also allowed him to continue an untrammeled rise within the administration\u2014including dating Trump\u2019s fake daughter, Hope Hicks, to whom the president affectionately creepily refers as \u201cHopie\u201d and \u201cHopester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, the president knew for months that Porter had been accused of domestic abuse, and even after Tuesday\u2019s bombshell report by the Daily Mail, which included claims that Porter was both verbally and physically abusive to his ex-wives, the White House was still scrambling to keep him on staff.\n\nPorter denied the allegations but resigned Wednesday. The White House, however, announced shortly after his resignation that Porter wouldn\u2019t be leaving the White House immediately, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cThese outrageous allegations are simply false. I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,\u201d Porter said in a statement provided by the White House, Axios reports. \u201cMy commitment to public service speaks for itself. I have always put duty to country first and treated others with respect. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served in the Trump Administration and will seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich raises the question, why is the White House working so hard to keep Porter on staff? Well, I can\u2019t make this any plainer: Porter is dating Hopie! Hopie is not only the president\u2019s fake daughter (totally normal for this president to have a fake daughter; seriously, there is nothing to see here) but is also considered a member of the untouchable staff, which includes the president\u2019s actual family. CNN notes that before Porter resigned, Hopie, who serves as the White House communications director, helped draft a supportive statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him,\u201d the statement from Kelly reads, CNN reports.\n\nKelly now notes that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the allegations against Porter but stands by his initial statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, get this, CNN notes that the claims against Porter were found during a routine background check by the FBI a year ago. So Porter worked at the White House for a year, worked very closely with the president and his chief of staff, but didn\u2019t have security clearance? Where they do that at?\n\nClearly, President \u201cGrab \u2019em by the Pussy\u201d is no feminist. Hell, he told the repugnantly smug Piers Morgan as much during a recent interview. He\u2019s never been a champion of women\u2019s rights, yet 53 percent of white women voted against their self-interests to put him in office.\n\nThis president is trash, and clearly everyone around him is such. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that the president is flying by the seat of his pants and wearing his KFC bucket on his head because he has no clue what he\u2019s doing in the White House and doesn\u2019t care whom he offends.

It is very hard for large and powerful institutions to undermine their own power and authority. Foucault noted that in his writings. The status-quo is quite comfortable for an institution. Is there an incentive for tribal government to present a perfect image of itself? Absolutely. Does this present an incentive to fudge the facts? It absolutely does. Newsletters are for tribal-programs. Tribal-governments should work with the independent media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, it is always important to be clear, I do not believe our elected officials are inherently corrupt, nor do I believe that the creation of this publication was brought about with nefarious intent. What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

Only current Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had the sole authority to release the letter.\n\nHowever, now, thanks to the Post, we can read King\u2019s words of wisdom concerning the nominee, which may be timely now given that Sessions is working his way through his confirmation hearings as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. attorney general.\n\nOn the cover page accompanying the nine-page letter to Congress, the activist and civil rights leader wrote, \u201cAnyone who has used the power of his office as United States attorney to intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to our courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.

To help you get through this process, we present to you \u201cThe 6 Stages of Grief Over the Obamas Leaving the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\n1. Shock and Denial\n\nWhat? Barack and Michelle only have a month left in office? No! I still haven\u2019t bought them a housewarming gift. I went to the White House and didn\u2019t see a picture of Jesus having dinner with Martin, Malcolm, Tupac, Biggie and Harriet Tubman, so I was going to get a print for them to hang in the Lincoln Bedroom. Where did the time go? It seems like only yesterday, Republicans and conservatives were screaming, \u201cNot my president\u201d and vowing to obstruct the new commander in chief at every turn, and a scant eight years later, they\u2019re calling it unpatriotic and hateful! Man, time really flies when you\u2019re stabilizing the global economy, rebounding from the worst recession since the Great Depression, providing affordable health care to the entire country and killing the most wanted man on the planet!\n\nAnd what the hell are we supposed to do without Michelle? We\u2019re supposed to just go all willy-nilly from an Ivy League-educated barrister to an Eastern European plagiarist whose facial expression always looks like she\u2019s struggling to solve the Soul Train scramble board? That\u2019s not fair to the American people. As a matter of fact, I think your math might be off a little bit. I swear it can\u2019t be eight years already. Are you sure you counted all the days? Leap years, too? I don\u2019t believe you. I\u2019m gonna double-check.\n\n\n\n2. Pain and Guilt\n\nYeah, you were right. It has been a whole eight years. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. Barack and Michelle are really leaving. The White House chef is packing up the Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt and everything! This hurts too much. The uncertainty is giving me the bubble guts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel like this is all my fault. I think we all took the Obamas for granted. Maybe we just assumed our next president would know that \u201cbigly\u201d wasn\u2019t a word and that \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d is a couple of Greeks, but not a book of the Bible. Do you think Melania knows how to Dougie? You think Trump knows any Al Green songs or has any idea what \u201cHotline Bling\u201d is? (Although I\u2019m willing to bet there was at least one blond-haired white boy on his boarding school rowing team named \u201cDrake.\u201d) We didn\u2019t appreciate them when we had them, and now that Michelle and Barack are almost gone, what are we to do?\n\n\n\n3. Anger\n\nNo, I\u2019m not mad.\n\nOK, maybe I\u2019m a little upset.\n\nYou know what, America? You\u2019re damn right I\u2019m mad! Most of all, I\u2019m disappointed in all the white people. Now that you are faced with the prospect of returning to the era of dim-witted white men leading our country, you want to ask for a mulligan and change the Electoral College. Now, that\u2019s white privilege! Maybe you didn\u2019t know this, but ain\u2019t no do-overs in the Constitution, bih! You screwed up royally! It was just eight years ago when we had a leader who achieved all of his success because of his daddy, and an evil, white-haired vice president running everything behind the scenes! You wanna go back to that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I have to blame some of this on Barack Obama, too! He\u2019s been president for eight years. He saw the political and economic morass he inherited and he knew these other pea-brained, privileged politicians had neither the intellectual heft nor the perseverance to lead this nation. He knows how fragile white people are. Donald Trump probably hasn\u2019t sat on a toilet that wasn\u2019t gold-plated since he was a toddler (when he had a platinum training potty), and Hillary Clinton fainted after spending an entire day sitting down. Sitting down! Do you know how many times President Obama probably had pneumonia these past eight years?\n\nNone. Because he had s\u2014t to do.\n\nYet during these last eight years, Obama didn\u2019t see fit to gather some of the best quantum physicists, theoretical engineers and molecular scientists to create a time machine that would allow him to go back to the past and clone himself. The fact that our next president and first lady aren\u2019t named Darack and Rochelle Obama is a travesty, and I\u2019m placing all of the upcoming failures of the Trump administration (of which there will be many) squarely on the shoulders of Barack Obama\u2019s poor, non-time-machine agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I know it isn\u2019t his fault. Maybe I\u2019m a little too emotional right now.\n\n\n\n4. Bargaining\n\nMaybe we can make a deal. Can Barack and Michelle get an extension? If Barack Obama has been subject to every conceivable racist stereotype during the last eight years, why must his term end now? Why can\u2019t his presidency end on C.P. Time? Maybe Barack can just delay the Trump inauguration. I bet we can extend Barack and Michelle\u2019s stay at least a couple of months if they keep sending Donald texts that say, \u201cAlmost there. Pulling up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, I know. Here\u2019s a plan:\n\nBarack and Michelle can go back to the White House, ring the doorbell and, when Melania answers, tell her that they left their hot sauce, their Quran or some other b.s. white people believe black people can\u2019t live without. When they let the Obamas in, Barack just grabs Trump\u2019s phone and tweets, \u201cI quit.\u201d Apparently\u2014according to the lazy, new-millennium mainstream media\u2014Trump\u2019s tweet\u2019s are legally binding statements that rank somewhere between the Declaration of Independence and the red words in the New Testament. I bet it would work, because the fact-checking process in most media sources consists of someone reading over social media, shrugging their shoulders and mouthing the universal declaration of editorial journalistic integrity:\n\n\u201cSeems legit.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Depression\n\nAs the end of the Obama presidency draws closer, each day gets tougher. Every morning I wake up wondering if this is the last day I\u2019ll have health care. Every night I go to sleep knowing this may be my last because Donald Trump may wake up in the middle of the night and tweet something that leads to World War III.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI already miss the Obamas so much. Sasha and Malia feel like a part of my family. Am I going to get to see my little cousins again? In my head, Sasha was always starting something and blaming it on Malia. I bet she tattled on Malia all the time, too. And just like the stronger, older sibling, Malia took it because she loved her little Sasha\u2014even if she could be a little aggravating. See how I created that entire scenario in my head from nothing but press photos and imagination?\n\nThat\u2019s because for eight years, the Obamas allowed black people to dream. It wasn\u2019t just about what Barack and Michelle accomplished that made them great. It was about what they represented. For every year of America\u2019s existence, until a few years ago, the idea of a black president was\u2014at most\u2014a good, but too-outrageous-to-consider premise. It was for comedy sketches and science fiction movies. Then came the Obamas. An unblemished black man with a charming and successful black wife and a beautiful black family. They were an unbelievable possibility that actually came true and made us think anything was achievable.\n\nAnd now they\u2019re leaving.\n\n\n\n6. Acceptance\n\nIn a few weeks, the Obama portion of American history will come to an end. We think we are prepared. We are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Barack Obama will go down as the first black president. Even though the country seems intent on regression, maybe America will progress. Maybe the wall of presidential portraits will one day be more diverse than 42 white men and that one black dude. Or maybe this is a moment in time we were fortunate to have witnessed.\n\nI can imagine, years from now, when I am sitting on the passenger side of my great-great-grandson\u2019s anti-matter hovercraft, that he will turn down the satellite in-dash hologram machine giving us news about another police light-sabering of an unarmed black man, and ask me about the days of yore when we had a black president, and I will tell him about the two thousand, nine hundred and twenty days when a black man was the leader of the free world. How proud we were. How safe we were. How we prospered.\n\nUntil that day comes, I will hold on to these last few moments and remember the past seven years, 10 months, one week and two days (not that I\u2019m counting). I will not be rattled by the prospect of what is to come. I will not allow these last remnants of this time to be tarnished by hate or fear. When it is over, I will be glad I experienced it, and think back on it with a smile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019m gon\u2019 cry in the car.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "stages", "im", "michelle", "grief", "maybe", "obamas", "barack", "obama", "days", "think", "black"], "polarity": 0.031644630041011625, "subjectivity": 0.3816309239006607},

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election.

Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning.

It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.\u201d\n\nWith the announcement that he is Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general came concerns about allegations of racist statements in his past, and many have been left to wonder, who is Jeff Sessions?\n\n\n\nAccording to a report by CBS News, Sessions has been one of Trump\u2019s closest allies and was the first senator to announce his support for a Trump presidency. Sessions was previously considered for the position of secretary of defense and is an architect of Trump\u2019s immigration, counterterrorism and trade policies. Sessions is a Republican U.S. senator for the state of Alabama, and he has served in that position since 1997. In that time, he has served on the Senate Budget Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Armed Forces Committee, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Sessions was born in Selma, Ala., in 1946 and grew up in Hybart, Ala. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Huntingdon College and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Alabama. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1973 to 1986, attaining the rank of captain. He practiced law for a short time before spending two years as assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. In 1981 he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as the U.S. attorney for Alabama\u2019s Southern District. He remained in that position for 12 years. In 1986 Reagan nominated him to be a judge for the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Alabama. He was not confirmed by the Senate because there were concerns about past comments he had allegedly made about desegregation and civil rights groups. Then-Sen. Joe Biden urged Reagan to withdraw Sessions from consideration after Thomas Figures, an African-American former deputy of Sessions, testified that Sessions had once warned him to be careful about what he said \u201cto white folks,\u201d and confirmed allegations that Sessions had called the NAACP \u201cun-American.\u201d That same deputy said that Sessions had called him \u201cboy\u201d on more than one occasion and had said that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was \u201cOK until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d In 1995 Sessions was elected as Alabama\u2019s attorney general, and he left that post in 1997 to join the Senate. According to the Washington Post, Sessions advised Trump on whom to choose for vice president and was also in the running himself for the position. The Post says that Sessions is \u201camnesty\u2019s worst enemy\u201d because he has fought legal immigration and has opposed nearly every immigration bill that has come before the Senate in the past two decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Senate, Sessions has fought hard on issues pertaining to the budget as well as the military. He authored legislation that increased the amount of money that the families of fallen soldiers receive, and he is described as a \"budget hawk\" by his peers.\n\nMany in the general public are concerned about the openly racist comments attributed to him, including one statement that another attorney was \"a discredit to his race\" for fighting for voting rights. Calling a grown man \"boy\" and telling him that he should watch how he speaks \"to white folks\" is telling of a person who is undeniably influenced by the Jim Crow South he grew up in.\n\nMeanwhile, Sessions has claimed that he is not a racist.\n\n\u201cI am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,\u201d he said during the 1986 committee hearings. \u201cI am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks. I have supported civil rights activities in my state. I have done my job with integrity, equality and fairness for all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully the Senate Judiciary Committee will do its job and not make the American people more familiar with his racism through his actions as attorney general.\n\nMonique Judge is a freelance journalist in Los Angeles.

Yet Harrell\u2019s 20-year journey took her to places far darker and deeper.\n\n\n\nHarrell, who told her story to a reporter at Vice, said that she had been doing genealogical research in Louisiana for some years and was approached by a woman who told her that her family had been enslaved in the 20th century. That woman then introduced her to about 20 people who said they had all worked on the Waterford Plantation in St. Charles Parish, La., and had become indebted to the plantation owner.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve all heard of sharecropping and peonage (outlawed by Congress in 1867), but what made this truly modern-day slavery was that these workers were not allowed to leave the property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of those folks were tied to that land into the 1960s,\u201d Harrell said.\n\n\n\nOne story in particular, though, was chilling. Harrell said that after giving a lecture on genealogy and reparations in Amite, La., she met Mae Louise Walls Miller, who actually said these words: \u201cI didn\u2019t get my freedom until 1963.\u201d The abuse and terror of Miller\u2019s story mirrored the horrors of chattel slavery, supposedly outlawed some 100 years before.\n\nHarrell explained:\n\nMae\u2019s father Cain Wall lost his land by signing a contract he couldn\u2019t read that had sealed his entire family\u2019s fate. As a young girl, Mae didn\u2019t know that her family\u2019s situation was different from anyone else\u2019s. The family didn\u2019t have TV, so Mae just assumed everyone lived the same way her brothers and sisters did. They were not permitted to leave the land and were subject to regular beatings from the land owners. When Mae got a bit older, she would be told to come up to work in the main house with her mother. Here she would be raped by whatever men were present. Most times her and her mother were raped simultaneously alongside one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Miller\u2019s father, Cain, tried to escape, he was picked up by some folks claiming that they would help him. \u201cInstead, they took him right back to the farm where he was brutally beaten in front of his family,\u201d Harrell said. She continued:\n\n\n\nWhen Mae was about 14, she decided she would no longer go up to the house. Her family pleaded with her as the punishment would come down on all of them. Mae refused and sassed the farm owner\u2019s wife when she told her to work. Worrying that Mae would be killed by the owners, Cain beat his own daughter bloody in hopes of saving her. That evening still covered in blood, Mae ran away through the woods. She was hiding in the bushes by the road when a family rode by with their mule cart. The lady on the cart saw the bush moving. She got off to find Mae crying, bloodied and terrified. That white family took her in and rescued the rest of the Wall\u2019s later that night.\n\nHarrell was able to meet and interview Miller\u2019s father, who lived to be 107, and also to lecture with Miller for many years, during which, she said, Miller displayed \u201cunusual ticks from her upbringing\u201d:\n\nSometimes, when we would be at an event where there was free food, she couldn\u2019t stop eating. She told me this was from years of not knowing when she would eat again. There were other times she would need to take her shoes off. She had grown up not wearing shoes and said sometimes her feet felt uncomfortable when she wore them. The nuances of Mae\u2019s PTSD from growing up as a slave gave me a peek into what life must have been like for many of our ancestors who were held under such inhumane conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrell said that not only are these stories more common than we think, but because of the pervasive and unyielding terror inflicted on black bodies for so long, the fear of very real consequences persists to this day.\n\n\u201cAs I would realize, people are afraid to share their stories, because in the South so many of the same white families who owned these plantations are still running local government and big businesses,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey still hold the power. So the poor and disenfranchised really don\u2019t have anywhere to share these injustices without fearing major repercussions. To most folks, it just isn\u2019t worth the risk. So sadly, most situations of this sort go unreported.\u201d\n\nThe saddest part of this painful but true story, however, is that Harrell said that slavery continues to morph and redefine itself in the United States today, whether through the school-to-prison pipeline, private prisons or the money-bail system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t investigate and bring to light how slavery quietly continued, it could happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked.", "keywords": ["told", "harrell", "mae", "century", "family", "woman", "terror", "owners", "slavery", "emancipation", "took", "continued", "shocked", "land"], "polarity": -0.0017539682539682538, "subjectivity": 0.47474142951066023},

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["js", "limit", "bliges", "awards", "looks", "opal", "michael", "love", "great", "sag", "mary", "color", "look", "price", "eye", "black"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC.

I openly hate the president, and I don\u2019t hate much except avocados, most white policemen and Trump, so I wanted her stories of salacious cheating to be true.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I\u2019m not so sure. Last night, after the president\u2019s inaugural State of the Union, Daniels, whose real name is who gives a shit, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and basically said a bunch of nothing.\n\nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Daniels had been paid $130,000 to keep the affair between the sheets. The reported payment was made by Trump\u2019s attorney. On Tuesday, just one day before Daniels was to appear on Kimmel, she released a letter denying all of the reported allegations. This, of course, is after Daniels had booked the appearance on the show, and it was too late for Kimmel to find someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this also comes after Daniels announced that she was going on a \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip-athon around roadside strip joints.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kimmel from trying to hit Daniels with the hard questions. He asked her why the signatures on her denial letter didn\u2019t match up with the signature found on her autographs. Kimmel then asked if she signed the denial letter, to which Daniels evasively replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, did I? Doesn\u2019t look like my signature, does it?\u201d\n\nKimmel then asked if she knew where the letter came from and if she had authorized its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt came from the internet.\u201d\n\nNice.

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["hook", "tour", "america", "violent", "rates", "nearly", "law", "increase", "continues", "enforcement", "drug", "dishonest", "sessions", "crime", "safe", "watch"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

Yet Harrell\u2019s 20-year journey took her to places far darker and deeper.\n\n\n\nHarrell, who told her story to a reporter at Vice, said that she had been doing genealogical research in Louisiana for some years and was approached by a woman who told her that her family had been enslaved in the 20th century. That woman then introduced her to about 20 people who said they had all worked on the Waterford Plantation in St. Charles Parish, La., and had become indebted to the plantation owner.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve all heard of sharecropping and peonage (outlawed by Congress in 1867), but what made this truly modern-day slavery was that these workers were not allowed to leave the property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of those folks were tied to that land into the 1960s,\u201d Harrell said.\n\n\n\nOne story in particular, though, was chilling. Harrell said that after giving a lecture on genealogy and reparations in Amite, La., she met Mae Louise Walls Miller, who actually said these words: \u201cI didn\u2019t get my freedom until 1963.\u201d The abuse and terror of Miller\u2019s story mirrored the horrors of chattel slavery, supposedly outlawed some 100 years before.\n\nHarrell explained:\n\nMae\u2019s father Cain Wall lost his land by signing a contract he couldn\u2019t read that had sealed his entire family\u2019s fate. As a young girl, Mae didn\u2019t know that her family\u2019s situation was different from anyone else\u2019s. The family didn\u2019t have TV, so Mae just assumed everyone lived the same way her brothers and sisters did. They were not permitted to leave the land and were subject to regular beatings from the land owners. When Mae got a bit older, she would be told to come up to work in the main house with her mother. Here she would be raped by whatever men were present. Most times her and her mother were raped simultaneously alongside one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Miller\u2019s father, Cain, tried to escape, he was picked up by some folks claiming that they would help him. \u201cInstead, they took him right back to the farm where he was brutally beaten in front of his family,\u201d Harrell said. She continued:\n\n\n\nWhen Mae was about 14, she decided she would no longer go up to the house. Her family pleaded with her as the punishment would come down on all of them. Mae refused and sassed the farm owner\u2019s wife when she told her to work. Worrying that Mae would be killed by the owners, Cain beat his own daughter bloody in hopes of saving her. That evening still covered in blood, Mae ran away through the woods. She was hiding in the bushes by the road when a family rode by with their mule cart. The lady on the cart saw the bush moving. She got off to find Mae crying, bloodied and terrified. That white family took her in and rescued the rest of the Wall\u2019s later that night.\n\nHarrell was able to meet and interview Miller\u2019s father, who lived to be 107, and also to lecture with Miller for many years, during which, she said, Miller displayed \u201cunusual ticks from her upbringing\u201d:\n\nSometimes, when we would be at an event where there was free food, she couldn\u2019t stop eating. She told me this was from years of not knowing when she would eat again. There were other times she would need to take her shoes off. She had grown up not wearing shoes and said sometimes her feet felt uncomfortable when she wore them. The nuances of Mae\u2019s PTSD from growing up as a slave gave me a peek into what life must have been like for many of our ancestors who were held under such inhumane conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrell said that not only are these stories more common than we think, but because of the pervasive and unyielding terror inflicted on black bodies for so long, the fear of very real consequences persists to this day.\n\n\u201cAs I would realize, people are afraid to share their stories, because in the South so many of the same white families who owned these plantations are still running local government and big businesses,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey still hold the power. So the poor and disenfranchised really don\u2019t have anywhere to share these injustices without fearing major repercussions. To most folks, it just isn\u2019t worth the risk. So sadly, most situations of this sort go unreported.\u201d\n\nThe saddest part of this painful but true story, however, is that Harrell said that slavery continues to morph and redefine itself in the United States today, whether through the school-to-prison pipeline, private prisons or the money-bail system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t investigate and bring to light how slavery quietly continued, it could happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked.", "keywords": ["told", "harrell", "mae", "century", "family", "woman", "terror", "owners", "slavery", "emancipation", "took", "continued", "shocked", "land"], "polarity": -0.0017539682539682538, "subjectivity": 0.47474142951066023},

The time of year when President Racist von WallBuilder reads his prepared speech from a teleprompter, and a roomful of fat, rich white guys and affluent white women applaud as if the world were crafted from his tiny hands. This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W. Bush look palatable?\n\n\n\nBelow is a listing of planned protests that might even be effective if the president actually cared about the rest of the 99 percent.\n\n\n\nOff the top, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) aren\u2019t attending the president\u2019s address. Everyone knows that Auntie Maxine is not here to play nice with this president. Wilson and the president have never been on good terms, but that rift grew wider when the president reportedly told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that \u201che knew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d Wilson took offense at the heartless comment, and Trump, as he\u2019s been known to do, began attacking the congresswoman on Twitter. So when it came to this year\u2019s State of the Union, Wilson knew that the president didn\u2019t deserve her presence or her sweet cowboy hat!\n\n\n\n\u201cTo go would be to honor the president and I don\u2019t think he deserves to be honored at this time, after being so hateful towards black people and then black countries,\u201d she told CNN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeks had this to say about this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the New York Post reports: \u201cI cannot give this man, who does not respect me, the respect to be in that audience. I will not be there.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats who have noted that they won\u2019t be attending include Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.) and John Lewis (Ga.); Illinois Reps. Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) will be bringing Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victim Advocates, as his plus one; Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, will be a guest of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.); and Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who has researched and written about Taylor, will be a guest of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who went toe-to-toe with the president for his lack of concern after Hurricane Maria ravaged parts of Puerto Rico, will accompany Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nSeveral Congress members are using their invitations to bring faces of the immigration debate, specially those affected by the current stalemate over DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, affecting young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\n\nSome of the more prominent faces of the debate who will be in attendance: Cindy Garcia, the wife of Jorge Garcia, who was deported to Mexico earlier this month after living in the U.S. for 30 years. The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life. Not divorcing him feels like a protest against his happiness, and I think this could be the best silent protest of them all.", "keywords": ["white", "lists", "president", "congress", "state", "members", "guest", "trash", "union", "women", "trump", "wilson", "protests", "rep", "reps", "think", "black"], "polarity": 0.08556348675833969, "subjectivity": 0.43977479628214916},

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report. He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked. Sessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committe hearing with Rosenstein, Bass again wanted answers about documents coming from the FBI that appear to indirectly label the Black Lives Matter movement as a terrorist organization that threatens police. She also noted that members of the Black Lives Matter movement have been questioned by the FBI, yet no one seems to know anything about the document or how the conclusions in said document were made.

He said that Chicago police should be much tougher than they are right now, and he told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that the federal government would stay out of law enforcement\u2019s business. He has been critical of Obama\u2019s clemency efforts and said he would renew surveillance on mosques.\n\nAs the Post reports, this is the antithesis of an Obama Justice Department, which has supported broad changes in the criminal-justice system, partnered with Muslims in the fight against terrorism, scrutinized police departments and investigated high-profile incidents of police officers killing people.\n\nCivil rights advocates, including the Rev.

Yet Harrell\u2019s 20-year journey took her to places far darker and deeper.\n\n\n\nHarrell, who told her story to a reporter at Vice, said that she had been doing genealogical research in Louisiana for some years and was approached by a woman who told her that her family had been enslaved in the 20th century. That woman then introduced her to about 20 people who said they had all worked on the Waterford Plantation in St. Charles Parish, La., and had become indebted to the plantation owner.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve all heard of sharecropping and peonage (outlawed by Congress in 1867), but what made this truly modern-day slavery was that these workers were not allowed to leave the property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of those folks were tied to that land into the 1960s,\u201d Harrell said.\n\n\n\nOne story in particular, though, was chilling. Harrell said that after giving a lecture on genealogy and reparations in Amite, La., she met Mae Louise Walls Miller, who actually said these words: \u201cI didn\u2019t get my freedom until 1963.\u201d The abuse and terror of Miller\u2019s story mirrored the horrors of chattel slavery, supposedly outlawed some 100 years before.\n\nHarrell explained:\n\nMae\u2019s father Cain Wall lost his land by signing a contract he couldn\u2019t read that had sealed his entire family\u2019s fate. As a young girl, Mae didn\u2019t know that her family\u2019s situation was different from anyone else\u2019s. The family didn\u2019t have TV, so Mae just assumed everyone lived the same way her brothers and sisters did. They were not permitted to leave the land and were subject to regular beatings from the land owners. When Mae got a bit older, she would be told to come up to work in the main house with her mother. Here she would be raped by whatever men were present. Most times her and her mother were raped simultaneously alongside one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Miller\u2019s father, Cain, tried to escape, he was picked up by some folks claiming that they would help him. \u201cInstead, they took him right back to the farm where he was brutally beaten in front of his family,\u201d Harrell said. She continued:\n\n\n\nWhen Mae was about 14, she decided she would no longer go up to the house. Her family pleaded with her as the punishment would come down on all of them. Mae refused and sassed the farm owner\u2019s wife when she told her to work. Worrying that Mae would be killed by the owners, Cain beat his own daughter bloody in hopes of saving her. That evening still covered in blood, Mae ran away through the woods. She was hiding in the bushes by the road when a family rode by with their mule cart. The lady on the cart saw the bush moving. She got off to find Mae crying, bloodied and terrified. That white family took her in and rescued the rest of the Wall\u2019s later that night.\n\nHarrell was able to meet and interview Miller\u2019s father, who lived to be 107, and also to lecture with Miller for many years, during which, she said, Miller displayed \u201cunusual ticks from her upbringing\u201d:\n\nSometimes, when we would be at an event where there was free food, she couldn\u2019t stop eating. She told me this was from years of not knowing when she would eat again. There were other times she would need to take her shoes off. She had grown up not wearing shoes and said sometimes her feet felt uncomfortable when she wore them. The nuances of Mae\u2019s PTSD from growing up as a slave gave me a peek into what life must have been like for many of our ancestors who were held under such inhumane conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrell said that not only are these stories more common than we think, but because of the pervasive and unyielding terror inflicted on black bodies for so long, the fear of very real consequences persists to this day.\n\n\u201cAs I would realize, people are afraid to share their stories, because in the South so many of the same white families who owned these plantations are still running local government and big businesses,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey still hold the power. So the poor and disenfranchised really don\u2019t have anywhere to share these injustices without fearing major repercussions. To most folks, it just isn\u2019t worth the risk. So sadly, most situations of this sort go unreported.\u201d\n\nThe saddest part of this painful but true story, however, is that Harrell said that slavery continues to morph and redefine itself in the United States today, whether through the school-to-prison pipeline, private prisons or the money-bail system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t investigate and bring to light how slavery quietly continued, it could happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked.", "keywords": ["told", "harrell", "mae", "century", "family", "woman", "terror", "owners", "slavery", "emancipation", "took", "continued", "shocked", "land"], "polarity": -0.0017539682539682538, "subjectivity": 0.47474142951066023},

I didn\u2019t smoke weed in front of her. What I actually did was whip out a joint and tell her I was going to smoke it in her bathroom, where she regularly smokes her cigarettes to keep her apartment from smelling like tobacco. So I was actually trying to be respectful by hotboxing her bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she saw the joint, she made that face mothers make right before they say, \u201cWhat you not gon\u2019 do \u2026 \u201d But my mother didn\u2019t say anything. She just shook her head and walked away.\n\n\n\nNow, my mom kinda suspected that I was a weed smoker. But when California finally legalized recreational marijuana\u2014or adult use of marijuana, which some pro-cannabis activists prefer because, honestly, no one ever says \u201crecreational alcohol\u201d or \u201crecreational cigarettes\u201d about the two legal vices enjoyed and consumed by grown-ass people\u2014I thought it was time to clear the air, so to speak, and make it plain that I do enjoy legal weed, just as she enjoys her legal cigarettes.\n\nI mention this story because it appears that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be back on that bullshit about cracking down on marijuana. On Friday he met with a group of anti-legalization activists behind closed doors, and I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t swapping Christmas-cookie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, Sessions has never met with pro-pot activists during his first year in office. And last week, a video emerged showing Sessions in full asshole mode mocking a Department of Justice intern about her stance on marijuana while making a few misleading statements of his own (more on that later).\n\nSessions, who\u2019s been pretty wishy-washy about marijuana policy as attorney general, has famously said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d But that statement defies logic when you consider that 29 states have legalized medical marijuana and seven states plus Washington, D.C., have co-signed recreational weed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know any good people, which isn\u2019t hard to believe, to be honest.\n\nBut Sessions aside, there is still a pretty strong social stigma around people who use weed. The image of the stoner stuck on a couch eating Cheetos is probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of a weed smoker, which is why it\u2019s time for the good, weed-smoking people of America to let it be known that they happily puff-puff-pass while still managing to contribute to society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence has shown that weed is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, yet the federal government classifies it as a Schedule I drug, the highest classification, which puts marijuana on par with heroin. Our government thinks weed is more dangerous than Schedule II drugs cocaine and crystal meth, which is fucking bananas.\n\nSessions once even claimed that marijuana was \u201conly less awful than heroin,\u201d which is utter horseshit when you consider that the number of overdoses from opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers skyrocketed in 2016. (Sessions just recently conceded that weed isn\u2019t as bad as heroin. Gee, thanks, little buddy!)\n\nYou know how many people have died from a marijuana overdose in the history of marijuana? Zero.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study even suggested that opiate-related deaths went down after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, and some experts believe that cannabis could actually help ease the abuse of opioids, which account for 63 percent of all drug-related deaths.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of opioids, in that video with the intern, Sessions claimed that last year was the first time that drugs rather than alcohol caused more fatal car accidents. He\u2019s basically correct on that point (the year was actually 2015), except the issue is more nuanced than that.\n\nSince police still don\u2019t have a reliable DUI test for weed (officers are mainly just judging behavior to determine if a driver is high), it\u2019s difficult to know what role, if any, weed may have played in an accident, especially since marijuana stays in your system awhile after actual use. But what Sessions failed to mention is that there\u2019s also been a huge spike in prescription-opioid-related fatal car crashes (however, the same rule about no reliable DUI test also applies to opioids).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also asked that intern to check with the American Medical Association about the dangers of marijuana. Again, while Sessions is right that the AMA says marijuana is a dangerous drug and recreational weed should not be legalized, he didn\u2019t mention that the organization has also called for more research on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis. Because legalization is moving way faster than research, rescheduling the drug to open up scientific study makes even more sense from a public health point of view.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that black and brown people are still getting arrested at higher rates for marijuana possession, even in states with legal weed, so coming out wholeheartedly as a weed smoker still carries some real-life consequences (the prohibition of weed has always been primarily about race).\n\nBut really, the best way to destroy the stereotypical image of a pothead is to replace it with an image that looks more like you and me.

John\u2019s father, Peter, also invested in slave ships, bringing 46 slaves between 1730 and 1733.

Sessions continued by saying that the over-policing of black communities is needed to \u201cconfront violent crime in America in cities that have abandoned traditional police activity like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Sessions also pushed a popular right-wing narrative that murder rates \u201chave surged, particularly in poor neighborhoods,\u201d which thereby constitutes over-policing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that Sessions\u2019 position was dismissive as the way in which he cavalierly acted as if the student had no fucking clue what he was talking about. It also doesn\u2019t help that the student never got to ask a question because the asshole just couldn\u2019t wait to interrupt and answer something that wasn\u2019t asked.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s move over to the peak level of Sessions\u2019 assholishness.\n\nHere\u2019s how Politico described the interaction:\n\nAnother student, a woman attending Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, told the attorney general that \u201cstatistically, guns kill more people than marijuana does.\u201d \u201cYou support pretty harsh policies for marijuana and pretty lax gun control laws \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure where you stand on the assault weapons ban,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to know, since guns kill more people than marijuana, why lax laws on one and harsh laws on the other?\u201d Sessions laughed and called her question one of \u201capples and oranges\u201d before remarking: \u201cThe Second Amendment \u2014 you\u2019re aware of that \u2014 guarantees the right of the American people to keep arms, and I intend to defend that Second Amendment. It\u2019s as valid as the First Amendment.\u201d The attorney general knocked the notion that marijuana is \u201charmless\u201d and \u201cdoes no damage.\u201d \u201cMarijuana is not a healthy substance, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Medical Association is crystal clear on that. Do you believe that?\u201d The student hesitated. \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cOK. Dr. Whatever Your Name Is, you can write the AMA and see why they think otherwise,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Asshole Book of Commandments, Chapter 6, verse 1, it clearly states that giving someone a title that you know they don\u2019t have to prove that they don\u2019t know what they are talking about makes you an asshole. It wasn\u2019t as if the students were being belligerent. Based on his policy and position, they were asking for clarity, but you know what they say about asking assholes questions: You\u2019re bound to get shitty answers.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nAlso, fuck Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead more at ABC News and Politico.", "keywords": ["talking", "attorney", "general", "department", "widely", "held", "complete", "student", "wasnt", "question", "belief", "sessions", "jeff", "justice", "asshole", "confirms", "marijuana", "know", "video"], "polarity": 0.1055940129053336, "subjectivity": 0.49059939012769194},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["remember", "president", "white", "notes", "teacher", "teachers", "victims", "care", "violent", "school", "trump", "going", "house", "check", "listening", "massshooting"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

We wish her the best in future endeavors and are grateful for her service.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sanders tends to lead her contentious White House press briefings with the mantra \u201cI\u2019m gonna huff and puff and blow the FAKE NEWS media away with my lies.\u201d So why would I believe any of her bullshit now?\n\n\n\nCertainly not when more plausible scenarios have been presented before me like those from New York Times reporter Yamiche Alcindor. Although Alcindor notes that a White House source is disputing that claim, other outlets like the Wall Street Journal are, too, reporting that Omarosa was \u201cphysically dragged and escorted off the campus.\u201d As are reporters like American Urban Radio Network\u2019s April Ryan, whom if you recall, is a former friend of Omarosa\u2019s and accused The Apprentice alum of trying to \u201cphysically intimidate her\u201d following a rift.\n\n\n\nI can definitely see Omarosa cursing out John Kelly. And considering his treatment of black women recently, he\u2019s probably thanking White Jesus and White Santa that he has rid himself of her. There have been reports of Kelly not exactly enjoying Omarosa being around. In fact, it was those \u201cmounting tensions\u201d with Kelly that\u2019s allegedly led to her dismissal guised as a resignation\u2014which explains previous stories of her being the most \u201cdespised person in the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just have one question for Omarosa: Was it worth it, sis?\n\nC\u2019mon: Omarosa wanted a title and she aligned herself with a racist to get it.\n\nIn July 2016, Omarosa officially joined the Trump campaign as director of African-American outreach. No one, especially not someone like her who spent time at the White House in the 1990s, actually believed that this astonishingly stupid man with no government experience was primed to run the nation, even if his delusions convinced him otherwise. Yes, she and Trump worked together when she was a cast member on The Apprentice and he served as a producer of her old TV One dating show The Ultimate Merger, but c\u2019mon: Omarosa wanted a title and she aligned herself with a racist to get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter whatever rapport they may have had, the reality is Omarosa was a black woman working with a white supremacist who cozied up to other white supremacists and has long proven himself to be a disloyal narcissist. How did she expect this to end?\n\nOf course she had to be dragged out of the place. She sacrificed what little reputation she had as a pastor and a woman with a PhD to work with the village idiot and his band of sheetless Klansmen. Unfortunately, while she did earn the title \u201cassistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison\u201d and a salary of $179,700 (the maximum salary for any White House staffer), what does she have to show for it?\n\nShe\u2019s been clowned for finally getting a job and then mocked for no one knowing what she does with her job. Any reporting about her job is mostly related to black Republicans hating her (all 14 of them, I guess) and get a meaningless executive order tied to HBCUs signed. Oh wait, we found out she brought her homegirls to the White House for a bridal shower and got shut down by folks curious about the activities of someone who barely seems to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Omarosa has been silent while Sweet Potato Saddam has attacked black women such as ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill, Rep. Frederica Wilson, and Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson. She\u2019s been silent through her boss\u2019 thinly-veiled racist attacks on NFL players and their right to protest systemic racism he and his administration help perpetuate.\n\nJust imagine Omarosa trying to roll up at the next Essence festival.\n\nIn sum, black people hate the president more than ever, and after being awarded with a job title at The White House for purported \u201cloyalty,\u201d Omarosa had her black ass allegedly dragged out of The White House. Speaking of \u201cThe Blacks\u201d as her now ex-boss likes to call us, she is forever tainted. Perhaps some might forgive her, but most of us will not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust imagine Omarosa trying to roll up at the next Essence festival. They\u2019re going to have to hold various aunties back from throwing crawfish tails at her head for this betrayal. Same goes for the Soul Train Awards, the BET Awards, or anywhere else her red carpet loving self tries to show up at. Hell, Omarosa will probably have to duck \u201cthe saints\u201d at The Stellar Awards, too, who can\u2019t wait to call her everything but a child of God in the name of Jesus. The same goes for conferences, too, given she showed up at this year\u2019s NABJ Conference ready to knuck and buck and fight with veteran news anchor Ed Gordon over questions of her aligning herself with that apricot-hued bigot.\n\n\n\nFor those who might bring up Kanye West, let me say that one, I haven\u2019t forgotten and shade him accordingly, and two, Omarosa didn\u2019t drop Late Registration. Likewise, I stopped paying Steve Harvey a lot of mind, but even he was smart enough to try and backtrack. No, Omarosa is more like the political equivalent of Mean Mary (Tina Campbell) of Mary Mary: stubborn, smug, and nasty about her support of the president and anyone who questions her over it.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what Omarosa is going to do next, but it couldn\u2019t have been all worth it. And as for the saying \u201cyou can always come home again,\u201d she should now consider that fake news.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "job", "trying", "omarosa", "worth", "title", "racist", "house", "sis", "kelly", "black"], "polarity": -0.015413059163059172, "subjectivity": 0.3521737169834996},

I mean, how do we know Chris really exists or if he\u2019s just some imaginary entity that they made up precisely for the moments when an actual black person confronts them about their real racism?

You never asked them about the Wu-Tang Clan. You never told them about the Wu-Tang Clan. They just assumed that, because you are black, you enjoy the Wu-Tang Clan and now you all have something in common and now you\u2019re friends (which they\u2019ll use later when referencing you as their black-people pope).\n\nSo we\u2019re clear, it\u2019s possible to enjoy black things while still hating black people.

Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events.

He\u2019s turned his White House into the location of a horrible reality show. He\u2019s turned Twitter into a weapon of mass destruction. He\u2019s made the United States the most hated country on the planet (again).\n\nNow he\u2019s managed to turn the legislative budgeting process into a ridiculous hostage-taking action movie, complete with colorful henchmen and elaborate traps.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, at midnight, the federal government will go dark because Republicans can\u2019t figure out how to pay their bills. In a fair, rational world, Republicans would admit that it\u2019s their own party\u2019s inability to realize that 2 plus 2 does not equal \u201cMake America great again\u201d that caused this problem in the first place. However, we\u2019re not in a rational world anymore. We\u2019re in a world where accused pedophiles quote Jesus and run for office, a man who calls protesting black NFL players sons of bitches and quotes Martin Luther King Jr., and Cardi B has more top 10 hits than Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nThe Republicans want to hold 850,000 government employees, 800,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals-program recipients and 9 million kids in the Child Health Insurance Program hostage until their demands are met. They insist that the Democratic Party must vote yes on a new budget that funds the government only until Feb. 16, ignores DACA and shortchanges CHIP. The only way the GOP will even touch DACA is if the bill includes funding for Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite nationalist climbing wall\u201d\u2014otherwise the government fails and the kids get nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m convinced that the Democrats\u2014who, up until now, have shown the negotiating skills of a drunk frat boy in Tijuana\u2014must\u2019ve watched a TNT marathon of Olympus Has Fallen or sought the hostage-negotiating counsel of Denzel Washington. (Seriously, next to Jesse Jackson, what black man has saved more people in distress? From that early scene in Ricochet to Man on Fire, John Q and Inside Man\u2014hell, he killed Stringer Bell\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure Denzel could balance the budget, fix immigration and disarm North Korea in 90 minutes. My man!) Either way, Democrats will have to figure out how to stand up to the Republicans\u2019 demands. The only question now is, Who. Blinks. First?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out how we got to this standoff on top of a windswept mountain, with both parties giving speeches about what they not gon\u2019 do. Basically, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t know how to govern. Even though Republicans run everything in Washington, D.C.\u2014the presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the kiosk in Union Station, the Panera in the Capitol Cafeteria\u2014they can\u2019t even get their own party to agree on a long-term budget for government funding.\n\nThe DACA program was ended by Trump, creating a conflict where there was none. The CHIP program expired under GOP leadership; they could fix it in one vote, but they won\u2019t. Since Republicans can\u2019t get their own house in order, they\u2019ll grab CHIP and DACA at gunpoint, hoping to force the Democrats to make up for votes they can\u2019t sway in their own party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is, many Republicans and Democrats are tired of voting for short-term budgets because it wreaks havoc on federal agencies. It\u2019s hard to plan for disaster relief when your credit card might stop working every six weeks. When the last continuing resolution was passed in the House and the Senate in late December, Republicans were mad that it didn\u2019t give more money to the military. Democrats were angry that it didn\u2019t provide a solution for the 800,000 DACA recipients, and members of Congress who actually have fully beating hearts and functional souls were unhappy that 9 million kids might go without CHIP funding in the coming decade.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans in the House managed to pass a short-term spending bill, but passing it in the Senate is another matter. In order to reach the 60 votes needed, every Republican has to vote for the funding bill and about 11 Democrats have to switch sides. Democrats have been screaming \u201cRelease the hostages\u201d\u2014aka calling for a clean DACA bill and CHIP funding\u2014for months now. And Republicans have responded by cocking the trigger: Drop DACA, accept less funding for CHIP, pay for the border wall, give us all your Netflix and Amazon.com passwords, and we\u2019ll have a deal. (The Dems only agreed to the last one.)\n\nI\u2019d like to give credit to Democrats for being principled and holding their ground for kids, but this situation is also because of GOP incompetence. The reason Democrats aren\u2019t folding like MacBooks is that Republicans are lousy hostage takers. They\u2019re like those Somali pirates in Captain Phillips. You aren\u2019t really in charge if you can\u2019t drive the boat, and Republicans can\u2019t even find the steering wheel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nDespite numerical majorities in both houses of Congress, the Republicans only look like they\u2019re in control of the situation. First, Democrats know that even if they voted for a continuing resolution, Republicans would find some way to gut CHIP down the road in a future budget. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the negotiators, also know that President \u201cShithole\u201d is not about to let 800,000 Hispanic kids stay in America; he ended DACA because he is a white nationalist and doesn\u2019t want those kids in America.\n\nIf Trump actually wanted a policy solution with \u201clove,\u201d he could simply reinstate DACA and work with Congress on a solution. But he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t care. When the government shuts down (and it looks all but assured at this point), the party that runs everything in the country is going to get blamed, not the Democrats.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost good movie negotiators figure out the obvious: The hostages are dead anyway. There\u2019s no reason to negotiate. No one will blame you if the serial killer blows up the building and everybody inside because anyone who\u2019s watching knows that you\u2019re dealing with a crazy person.

While criminal charges against Slager ended in a mistrial last year, Slager has pleaded guilty to federal charges of deprivation of rights under the color of law. In doing so, Slager owned up to using excessive force in Scott\u2019s death, admitting that he hadn\u2019t shot Scott in self-defense as he originally claimed (cellphone video caught Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Slager\u2019s attorneys say, the ex-cop wasn\u2019t lying. He was just stressed out. And they\u2019re using Jeff Sessions\u2019 \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d (read: trash) memory as evidence.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, federal prosecutors are seeking an enhanced sentence against Slager for obstruction of justice\u2014a punishment that they feel he deserves for lying his ass off for two years. But defense lawyers claimed in a federal court filing last week that Slager\u2019s inconsistent accounts of Scott\u2019s death were the result of intense pressure.\n\n\u201cA Swiss cheese memory is a symptom of stress, not an indicator of lying,\u201d they wrote, including testimony from a medical expert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause this is 2017, Slager\u2019s attorneys then cited Sessions\u2019 conflicting and ever changing accounts of his contact with Russian agents as an example.\n\nHere is their argument, from the Post:\n\n\u201cUnlike Slager, who had been in what he perceived a life and death struggle before he made his statements, Sessions had time to prepare for his Congressional testimony, yet still often got it wrong,\u201d they wrote in their filing. \u201cWhy? According to Sessions, he was working in chaotic conditions created by the Trump campaign,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis was undoubtedly stressful, though not as stressful as having shot a man to death, or dealing with the aftermath of that, or facing the death penalty or life in prison. As Sessions made clear in his statement, a failure to recall, or an inaccurate recollection, does not a liar make.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Slager\u2019s attorneys really believe that Sessions was being honest in his congressional testimony? It\u2019s possible. But citing Sessions is a calculated move meant to put the Department of Justice\u2014whose prosecutors brought the federal charges against Slager\u2014in an awkward position. Essentially, DOJ prosecutors can\u2019t insist that Slager is a liar without implying, however indirectly, that their boss is probably one, too.\n\nIt\u2019s transparent as hell\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work.\n\nHere\u2019s another section from the defense filing:\n\n\u201cLike Sessions, Slager never lied or misled anyone,\u201d the defense attorneys\u2019 filing reads. \u201cLike Sessions, he answered the questions that were asked. When he had his memory refreshed, he added the refreshed recollection to his testimony. When he failed to remember certain items, it can be attributed to the stress or chaos of the event during which the memory should have been formed.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorally bankrupt courtroom arguments aren\u2019t unique to 2017. Neither, unfortunately, is police brutality.

That\u2019s what makes some (read: people suffering through white guilt) either squirm in their seats when watching this type of \u201centertainment\u201d or avoid it at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root 100 honoree Dee Rees wrote the screenplay to Mudbound with Virgil Williams, based on the book by Hillary Jordan. One of my favorite parts of Rees\u2019 version of Mudbound is how she relies on the characters\u2019 narration of their plights to carry the story along. It\u2019s as if their inner thoughts pull you in and make you a part of their world. You hear Mary J. Blige\u2019s character, Florence Jackson, speak of her son, Ronsel, whom you watch go off to fight on the front lines of World War II, and she says, \u201cI held his heartbeat in my hands\u2014\u201d Immediately you realize that you\u2019re in for something deeper than you may be ready for.\n\nWhen you think of the word \u201cmud,\u201d you\u2019re immediately surrounded by stiff, thick, filthy earth you want to stay away from. But that wasn\u2019t the case for the farmers and sharecroppers in rural Mississippi. They were surrounded by, steeped in and almost defined by the mud\u2014hence: Mudbound.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Blige) are tenant farmers in Mississippi, and the land they work is purchased by a white man, Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke). This is a man who hardly has any common sense, no real business sense and an icebox where his heart used to be. He pulls his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), and their two daughters wherever he sees fit to move them, hoping for golden opportunities to keep his family well within their privilege. And that privilege is apparent, even though the McAllans are forced to slum it with the \u201cNegroes\u201d who work the farm.\n\nThe Jacksons represent the black family who try against all odds to make their way out of the expected. Both Hap and Florence work tirelessly to make sure their children are clothed and fed and still have the capacity to dream farther than the mud in front of them. It just hurts watching and knowing that black poverty is worlds apart from white poverty.\n\nEven when Henry moves his privileged family onto the farm, he is still above all the people who have broken their backs for that land. He and his family are allowed to walk into stores through the front door, drive miles around the farm in their cars and demand that someone else help them with their children, even though Henry\u2019s wife, Laura, is a stay-at-home mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence\u2019s oldest son, Ronsel, returns from war and befriends Henry\u2019s veteran brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), and that friendship continues the exposure to the narrative of inequality that frustrates you throughout the film. As a soldier, Ronsel saw the world outside of America and experienced a freedom that the land of the free couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t offer up to him. It has made returning home bittersweet; he is tortured in his longing to be treated like a human being and finds camaraderie in Jamie.\n\n\n\nJamie acts as a conscience against racism. Naturally, a white savior shows up in these narratives, and I think it helps to ease white guilt, but the way Rees and Williams wrote the Jamie character shows the complicated reality of how a man is raised one way, experiences the world and then tries against all that surrounds him to show up differently than he\u2019s been taught.\n\n\n\nBut Jamie\u2019s character isn\u2019t perfect. He suffers through post-traumatic stress disorder and uses alcohol as a coping mechanism. His father, Pappy (Jonathan Banks), is the most racist villain in the movie and antagonizes everyone who isn\u2019t him\u2014even his own sons. At one point, Hap tells his son (who had to apologize for putting Pappy in his place): \u201cNo use in fighting. They just gonna win every time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat line socked me right in my ribs! And so did this movie. While each actor gave a performance that is easily Oscar-worthy, the women of the film stuck with me. Watching Blige\u2019s character, Florence, leave her own children to attend to Laura McAllan\u2019s, and take on her husband\u2019s job when he was injured, left my face stained with tears. The experience of black women having to take nanny jobs and neglect their own children is common throughout history and even now. And somehow, those black\u2019s women\u2019s children still have to push through life without having their mothers there to help guide and rear them.\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t there a proverb that says black women get shit done? Florence proves this. There\u2019s no job too big or too belittling for her. Everything she does is for the elevation of her family. In the 1940s, it was common for men to be the head of the household, and there was no questioning or alternatives. This is a very apparent theme in Mudbound, but it is also obvious that if the man is the head, the woman is the neck.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlorence and Laura show how women of those times stayed silent but also had a magical quality in allowing the man to think he\u2019s making decisions, when it\u2019s really the woman\u2019s plan all along. In The Root\u2019s interview with Blige and Mulligan, they share what it took to play these seemingly meek but obviously strong female characters:\n\nThe beauty of Mudbound is that it\u2019s on Netflix (premiering Nov. 17), so you can watch at your own pace. I walked out of the controversial movie Detroit because of the repetitive torture inflicted on black bodies, but I stayed in my seat for Mudbound because Dee Rees offered something that Kathryn Bigelow couldn\u2019t: heart and storylines.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there is lynching. Yes, the word \u201cnigger\u201d will ring in your ears. Yes, there are members of the Ku Klux Klan in this film. But there\u2019s also a story of resilience, the strength of fighting for a country that doesn\u2019t even want you in it, the stability of an unbreakable family structure and a bird\u2019s-eye view of how racism is bigger than all of us. Well done, Dee Rees.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "racism", "mudbound", "man", "america", "family", "exhausting", "world", "rees", "florence", "children", "women", "executed", "inequality", "tale", "properly", "black"], "polarity": 0.06688253968253968, "subjectivity": 0.4630613756613757},

Under most circumstances, a failed presidential party nominee running for a Senate seat wouldn\u2019t be big news. It\u2019d be the equivalent of LeBron James retiring to become a player-coach for Duke after realizing he couldn\u2019t beat Golden State.\n\nHowever, since the 2016 presidential election, Romney has been reimagined by much of the public, and many members on the right, as some sort of moral center and lead anti-Trumpist for the Republican Party. A man willing to call out President Donald Trump for his many foul and inappropriate deeds. Just check out these hits:\n\n\n\nWho can forget Romney calling Trump a phony and a fraud during the 2016 presidential election season?\n\nOr the remix version, when brave Romney called Trump a comforter of and cheerleader for racists after the president\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack? From Facebook:\n\nWhether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn. His apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the feeling was mutual. Donald Trump holds a lot of grudges against Mitt Romney.\n\nHe\u2019s never forgiven Romney for calling him a fraud and a phony; he was furious that prominent Republicans wanted Romney to run as a third-party candidate in 2016; and last, Trump probably can\u2019t get over the fact that even though they\u2019re only a year apart in age, Romney\u2019s mane is always perfectly laid, while Trump\u2019s head looks like he\u2019s had more implants than Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemonstrating the penchant for pettiness that has defined his presidency, Trump spent the first few months after the election engaging in an elaborate Lucy-and-the-football scheme, with Romney doing the most earnest Charlie Brown impression possible. And after months of publicly wining and dining Romney, Trump turned around and gave the job of secretary of state to Rex Tillerson, a Russian-business crony with less experience than on Romney\u2019s pre-Massachusetts r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough; late last year, Trump actively tried to block Romney from running for Senate. In other words, if Romney had even the slightest drop of personal integrity, or even cared about his brand as the moral opposite of Trump, or wanted to keep those rumors alive that he might actually primary Trump in 2020, he\u2019d stick to his guns like he did in 2016, right? He would run for Utah Senate as the anti-Trump or at least make it clear that he was his own man.\n\nExcept no. Mitt Romney is a spineless, craven politician thirsty for any semblance of relevance after America rejected his brand of disingenuous, sanctimonious leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny dreams that he would stand up to Trump (and those had to be drug-induced fantasies born of nothing more than an unrealistic faith in a politician who said that 47 percent of the country wasn\u2019t worth talking to) went out the window when he tweeted this on Monday:\n\nMind you, Trump has never apologized or changed his tune about Charlottesville; within the last week, more women have come out to accuse him of sexual improprieties; and he was defending an alleged abusive spouse less than two weeks ago\u2014and that was after he wholeheartedly endorsed a man accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, now Romney is proud to have this endorsement that was supposedly too awful to accept two years ago. I would say that the voters of Utah deserve better, but they elected Mia Love, so there is that.\n\nI think conservatives deserve better, because if they actually want to run someone for the Senate who will at least morally stand up to Trump, they might want to nominate someone who can at least get off his hands and knees first.", "keywords": ["utah", "politician", "americas", "senate", "thirstiest", "romney", "mitt", "trump", "2016", "week", "election", "presidential", "run"], "polarity": 0.14503375977256575, "subjectivity": 0.46543176972281447},

Karen Bass (D-Calif.) completely dismantled U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Bass questioned why the FBI would be investigating and writing reports on \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d labeling them as a threat against the police, but not writing those same reports and conducting those same investigations on the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\n\nBass started out by asking the chairperson of the committee to allow her to enter into the record the recent FBI report \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.\u201d Sessions told Bass that he had not read the report, but he knew about some of the alleged targeting of officers by \u201ccertain groups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he could get into his line of bullshit on it, Bass asked him who in his department had the power to order the report to be put together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that report got ordered,\u201d Sessions said weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I explicitly approved it or directed it.\u201d\n\n[So you\u2019re in charge, but you have no idea how something like this could come about? OK, sir.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d]\n\n\u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d\n\nBass cut him off.\n\n\u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question. It\u2019s easy to label black people who fight for racial justice and racism as the actual racists when we know that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t follow that question,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPlease again?\u201d\n\nBass then asked her question even more directly than she did the first time: \u201cIs there a term or a report on white identity extremists? You mentioned you are familiar with black people who identify with their racial identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not coming to me at this moment.\u201d\n\n[OK, sir. You can\u2019t remember the name of ONE white extremist group? Really, former senator of Alabama? Not ONE? OK.]\n\nBass was incredulous: \u201cNot coming to you?\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t about to let Sessions off the hook that easily.\n\n\u201cCertainly a group such as the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d she said, in an attempt to jog his memory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat seemed to work. Suddenly Sessions remembered. \u201cYes, and then the skinhead movements, but there is racial identity white movements that have been identified for sure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo has the FBI done a report on white identity extremists that are likely motivated to target law-enforcement officers?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n[So, no. Just say that, sir. You haven\u2019t. You haven\u2019t because you are OK with white extremist groups.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCould you name an African-American organization that has committed violent acts against police officers? Could you name one today? In this report, they name organizations from 30 or 40 years ago, but can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?\u201d Bass asked.\n\nGotcha! Sessions waffled and could not name any such organization, because as we all know, that is some extreme bullshit.\n\n\u201cI believe I could, but I would want to be, um, to confirm that and submit it to you in writing, but I believe we had in the last year or so four police officers killed by a group that some have described as extremist,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was referring to the shooting in Dallas or perhaps in Baton Rouge, La., that they tried to tie to Black Lives Matter, but we all know that was some bullshit, too.\n\nBass cut to the chase and asked the most necessary question, because we know exactly whom the FBI were talking about and whom they were targeting when they put out that fake-ass report.\n\n\u201cWould you consider Black Lives Matter a black identity extremist group?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to comment on that. I have not so declared it,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAgain, Bass put out there what all of us have been thinking since that ridiculous report made the news, saying:\n\nSo, you should know that a lot of activists around the country are very concerned that we\u2019re getting ready to repeat a very sad chapter of our history, where people who are rightfully protesting what they consider to be an injustice in their community\u2014which is their relationship with police officers\u2014are now being targeted and labeled as extremists and are going through periods of surveillance and harassment, and so I would like to know, what is your department going to do to protect the rights of average citizens to protest if they have a concern about police officers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was quick to go on the offensive.\n\n\u201cThis department will not unlawfully target people,\u201d he said.\n\nBass then said:\n\nSo, if that\u2019s the case then, I would ask that you review this report\u2014\u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d\u2014because I personally don\u2019t believe that any such organizations exist. The organizations that are referred to in this report are organizations from decades ago, so I would like to know what will you do to essentially roll back what is listed in this report? Because it\u2019s not accurate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a pregnant pause while Sessions considered what lie he should let fly out of his mouth next.\n\nHe then said, \u201cWe will look at the report. I\u2019d actually be interested in reading it. But they usually do an excellent job\u2014objective and fair\u2014on those kind of reports.\u201d\n\n[Objective and fair? OK, Bilbo Bigot.]\n\nBass did a great job ripping into Sessions and getting him to basically admit that the \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d report was full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Lives Matter and other social groups that are fighting for racial equality and calling out the deaths of black men at the hands of police are not a threat to law enforcement. That is the narrative Sessions has been driving, however, since he took the job as attorney general. Enough is enough.\n\nSalute to Karen Bass.

During that season in New York City, every charity group, institution, media company and rando (including The Root) throws a ball, gala or fancy party of some kind. Our own shindig, The Root 100, goes down Nov. 9.\n\nSo October, for me, has been filled with parties both small\u2014like Facebook Marketplace\u2019s Halloween-themed soiree at Gary\u2019s Loft downtown\u2014and gigantic, like the Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball, held at the legendary Plaza Hotel, which honored R&B great Mary J. Blige.\n\nFor weeks now, I\u2019ve been running this party circuit, making a point not to turn down anything I get invited to, and needless to say, by the time I got to Jezebel\u2019s 10th-anniversary party at the Well in Brooklyn, I was pretty out of it. It didn\u2019t help that I was just fresh from yet another gala, the \u201cBuilding Academic Excellence in the Bronx and Stamford\u201d benefit for Excellence Community Schools, and just wanted to sleep. But I stayed there an hour anyway, enjoying a random Zazie Beetz-getting-her-life-on sighting and wondering what my life had become as I was out after work hitting the party scene for the fifth night in a row.\n\nShort version: Welcome to Antisocial, the society-and-events column for people who are terrified of both. I look so terrible, guys. So bad that I don\u2019t have bags under my eyes\u2014I have luggage. Like, the big kind made out of hard plastic, with an extended handle and wheels. I\u2019m just dragging my saggy eyes behind me, as if we\u2019re in the airport heading for a red-eye. Thank goodness for the rainy weekend, when I was able to do some catch-up and rest-up; otherwise I have no clue how I\u2019d get through this week, which is full of ... you guessed it ... even more things to do.\n\nThe 23rd Annual Black Tie & Sneakers Gala Benefiting the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best thing about the Black Tie & Sneakers Gala (aka \u201cthe SportsBall\u201d) is that it benefits a worthy cause, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, which does everything for the health and wellness of people\u2014particularly people of color. One standout program includes an HIV/AIDS-awareness campaign through which barbers and stylists are trained to talk to their clients about sexual health.\n\n\n\nThe second-best thing is that you get free sneakers with your swag bag.\n\nThis year they were Adidas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking place Oct. 18 at the Grand Hyatt in New York City, this year\u2019s benefit honored award-winning journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien, with whom I have the oddest history. Years ago she mentioned me by my blog name\u2014the Black Snob\u2014in a book once that misconstrued something I actually wrote in defense of her. It was awkward.\n\nIt got brought up on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources, of all things. I was mortified. Not mortified enough not to go to the SportsBall and have a great time and get me some Adidas, but several years back, sure! Mortified! When you\u2019ve been in the blog game as long as I have, you\u2019re bound to have irritated someone, at least once or several times, and I used to be pretty brutal with the whole blog thing. Savage, even.\n\n\n\nThese days, though ... well, I still have the potential to be savage, but I\u2019m more behind the scenes than actively in anyone\u2019s face. Much like how I was at the SportsBall: just kind of chilling, grateful that I gave up on wearing heels to galas so that I can actually enjoy all the standing around and noshing while chatting. Sure, a jazzy flat is not as fun as a dramatic heel, but when you have feet as flat as mine, a jazzy flat will do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNY1 news anchor Cheryl Wills and NBC 4 New York\u2019s David Ushery hosted the gala, which also honored Dr. Robert Gore of SUNY Downstate Department of Emergency Medicine; Dr. Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Kathy Hirata Chin, senior counsel at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\n\nNaturally Curly Presents The Curl Revolution\n\nThe day after the SportsBall, on Oct. 19, I dragged myself away from an after-work goodbye gathering to head to the Lightbox in midtown for Naturally Curly\u2019s book-launch party featuring founder Michelle Breyer and her new book, The Curl Revolution: Inspiring Stories and Practical Advice From the NaturallyCurly Community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere I met writer, podcaster and model Nikia Phoenix, aka \u201c100 Percent Nicole\u201d from those cool 23andMe ads. I was shocked, SHOCKED to learn that Nikia and her friend were longtime fans of ye olde Black Snob, something I haven\u2019t worked on in years now, since I started with The Root. I\u2019m always happy and humble to meet anyone who remembers me from my years of struggle, blogging about politics and popular culture for a small but dedicated audience.\n\nThe Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue fact. If DJ D-Nice is spinning, I want to go there. And so I did on Oct. 23: He was performing at the after-party for the Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball at the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe benefit was for the school\u2014operating out of the Herb Alpert Center\u2014which teaches dance, music, theater, and art and design to children as young as 2 and up to age 18. Many of those who currently work with the school are former students themselves, since the institution has been around since 1964, enriching the lives of economically and ethnically diverse children in New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of those students performed and took pictures at the gala, which also honored none other than R&B songstress Mary J. Blige.\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019m slowly (but surely) learning how not to burn myself out, I actually went home to rest up and change in between hitting the red carpet and going to the gala\u2019s after-party, which was incredibly lit. I went with my friend, the legendary jill-of-all-trades Sophia Chang, who essentially burned a hole in the floor dancing. When not dancing, she chatted up fellow legend MC Lyte, who was also there holding it down near D-Nice while he did the do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree things kept me from having a meltdown even though it was so late in the evening:\n\nI was there with a friend and ran into another friend (also a legend: New York City society columnist Audrey Bernard\u2014I felt blessed to be among so many legends), so I didn\u2019t have to wander around aimlessly trying to interrupt conversations and get to know a lot of strangers. Which is both good and bad: I literally met no one new at this party because I was so into either dancing with or talking to my friends.\n\nI was wearing a jazzy flat, so my horrible flat feet didn\u2019t give me the business.\n\nI drank a lot of Mo\u00ebt. Not enough that it was a problem, but just enough that I was mellow despite LOUD MUSIC and LIGHTS, all of which sometimes give me problems because of my very random sensory/light-noise-sensitivity issues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI only temporarily blanked out once, and it wasn\u2019t noticeable. (I think. I hope. I pray.)\n\n2 Dope Queens Taping for HBO in Brooklyn\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan\u2019t say much about this one because HBO will kill me, but 2 Dope Queens podcasters Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson (who used to write about hair for The Root) hosted a delightfully kick-ass comedy show at the Kings Theatre Oct. 23-25 in Brooklyn that I can\u2019t tell you anything about because it was a taping for a series of specials that will air on HBO next year.

I\u2019m going to be honest\u2014I had not a clue. And when I RSVP\u2019d for this shindig, I was totally RSVP\u2019ing to be RSVP\u2019ing and intended not to show up, but FOMO got the best of me, so I threw on a dress and ... you guessed it ... a jazzy flat (one of these days I\u2019m going to shock you and wear a heel so you can read 800 words of bitching about the invention of heels) and went anyway for Wibbitz\u2019s Roaring Twenties Bash on Oct. 25 at the Flatiron Room in New York City. Wibbitz, a video-creation platform, was not celebrating just to be celebrating, but was celebrating another 20 other than the 1920s: $20 million in Series C investment funding.\n\n\n\nAt the Wibbitz party were 101 people in media whom I did not know, which was great because I was forced to engage. They also tossed all of our name tags on a few tables, and it was impossible\u2014for me, at least\u2014to find my name, causing most of us to have some kind of chat about how we could or could not find our name. Great icebreaker.\n\n\u201cBuilding Academic Excellence in the Bronx and Stamford\u201d Benefit for Excellence Community Schools\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Marvet Britto of the Britto Agency extended an invite to the Excellence Community Schools\u2019 benefit gala Oct. 26 at the Mandarin Oriental (of which she was an event co-chair), I took it because it was Marvet Britto.\n\n\n\nI came to love and respect Marvet, whom I first met in 2012, when I was head writer of the Prince of West Memphis\u2019 (aka T.J. Holmes) old talk show on BET, Don\u2019t Sleep. She was representing T.J. and was his staunchest defender and advocate amid the constant changes that plagued our show. We\u2019ve stayed in touch since I moved back to New York in 2016.\n\nT.J.\u2014whom I used to jokingly stalk on my old blog\u2014is now with ABC News on Good Morning America. I hadn\u2019t seen him in person in years\u2014or spoken to him, besides the occasional email here and there, since 2013. So I was happy to see T.J. frickin\u2019 Holmes (frickin\u2019 because there were children present) at Marvet\u2019s table Thursday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso there was my buddy Sophia Chang, who has known Marvet for so long, they were calling each other nicknames; and Love & Hip Hop\u2019s Yandy Smith (rocking a white fur stole). I also got to meet MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, a Bronx guy who was being honored at the event, and ran into the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was scanning the room looking for someone who was decidedly not me, but I ran up any ol\u2019 way to say hey.\n\nJezebel 10\n\nThe same night as the Excellence Community Schools gala was a big party for our fellow Gizmodo Media Group site Jezebel, which was celebrating its 10th anniversary. This is where I saw Zasie Beetz rocking out to the beat; drank a cocktail called \u201cthe DivaCup,\u201d which was Campari and Champagne; and ate \u201cJ\u201d-branded cupcake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI showed up so late to the party at the Well in Brooklyn\u201411 p.m.\u2014that it was already winding down when I got there. Food\u2014which was allegedly delicious\u2014was scarce by the time I got there, and I missed meeting Jez\u2019s new editor-in-chief, Koa Beck. (But we\u2019ll be working out of the same office soon, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see her around.)\n\nI meant to mingle at Jez 10 but ended up just talking to my fellow Danielle\u2014my producer at The Root, Danielle Young\u2014and one of my video editors, Ashley Velez, about the upcoming The Root 100 event in New York City. Going to a celebratory work event and so ... many ... galas only reminded me that I had yet to reach the finish line with my own. Would we make it? Would it be grand? Would people have a good time? And who would show up?\n\nI commented that I was sure I was going to go bald this year because much of the burden of making this event pop is on myself and two others, unlike last year, when I had my publisher, Donna Byrd\u2014a seasoned veteran of literally every The Root 100 gala\u2014doing the heavy lifting. The training wheels are off, and now we must throw an epic party that fits our crunk-party reputation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope it\u2019s as good as the Harlem School of the Arts gala.

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["theories", "parkland", "fla", "used", "state", "douglas", "school", "shooting", "reform", "right", "seeking", "aide", "students", "survivors", "far", "gun", "stoneman"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

In fact, the only thing prolonging his exit is the fact that the press got wind of it early, and there is one thing the president can\u2019t stand, and that\u2019s being upstaged.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Tillerson once reportedly called Trump a \u201cmoron,\u201d and we all know that\u2019s all it takes for President Petty to cast you out of the kingdom (Mama Dee voice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "cnn", "rex", "state", "tillerson", "hes", "secretary", "trump", "house", "peel", "foot", "banana"], "polarity": 0.14506172839506173, "subjectivity": 0.5046296296296297},

He died, they took him out, when he was talking about economic inequality, when he was talking about the war, when he was talking about militarism.

The president of LittleDick, Ala., is literally spending his time posting phony winners for a phony awards show while the country is currently going to shit from his doing. I keep waiting for this bad Tom Hanks movie to end and the 9-year-old boy whose mind was switched with the president of MudTruckin\u2019, Minn., to be given his brain back.\n\nCurrently we have a president whose diet consists of fast food, who trolls America on Twitter and who makes up fake games to play with himself. It\u2019s as if Congress went to the local Cracker Barrel and asked for one of those busy sheets they give kids while the parents are talking to keep the president of FlyFishing, Fla., busy\u2014and thus the Fake News Awards were born.\n\nThe worst part of this whole sham is that the president of TabackySpitCup, Texas, has routinely told lies and mistruths since taking office. According to the Washington Post, Trump lied over 2,000 times during his first year in the White House. But in the spirit of bipartisanship, we\u2019re reporting Trump\u2019s list of winners because honestly, being opposed by the president of NASCAR, Neb., is a badge of honor.\n\nFirst off, like much of this administration, the shit didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know if the fake-news-media thing was supposed to be lighthearted or what, but late Wednesday night, after several outlets posted that the president was full of crap for announcing that the awards would be coming and then not producing, a seemingly rushed list was ushered onto the GOP\u2019s website, which immediately crashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s as if the website didn\u2019t even want any parts of this dumbass idea. Once the site was functioning, the winners included all the big names that Trump has openly opposed: the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, blah, blah, blah.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue with the New York Times piece cited is that it was a column claiming that the economy would suffer under a Trump presidency\u2014which isn\u2019t fake news because we still don\u2019t know what will happen, and Trump keeps claiming victory for the economic legacy that former President Barack Obama left behind. Assuming that Trump\u2019s plan for utter destruction did somehow boost the economy, the column still wouldn\u2019t be fake news; it would merely be an incorrect prediction, since it was written in 2016, before the president was even in office.\n\nThe Fake News Awards were always going to be a sham. In early January, the president claimed that there would be some kind of event and maybe even trophies!\n\n\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to spoil anything,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, said during a press briefing on Jan. 3, the Washington Post reports. \u201cBut my guess is that there are quite a few individuals that could be up for those awards. ... We\u2019ll certainly keep you posted. It might be hard for him to present trophies if you guys aren\u2019t there. But I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continually teased the idea of specific categories in the Fake News Awards\u2014a task that should have proved easy, considering that he tweeted about \u201cfake news\u201d some 150 times, according to the Post. But the Fake News Awards, much like this administration so far, proved to be a whole lot of talk and very little action. Basically, the Fake News Awards were just more fake news from a president who knows more about being fake than anyone else.\n\nRead more at GOP.com and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["president", "awards", "fake", "winners", "trump", "right", "times", "post", "know", "couldnt", "dont", "washington"], "polarity": -0.08126225987554113, "subjectivity": 0.5560200216450217},

I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding. However, she probably should have performed in the first or second hour. The sequencing of performances felt off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nTamar Braxton: Tamar Braxton can sing exceptionally well, but she was not singing a lick during her performance of \u201cMy Man.\u201d So why she was aggressively moving her wig like it was dipped in a fire ant bed before she glued it to her head is beyond me. I saved this for last because it was the absolute most.\n\nAll right, before I (let) go:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers to Solange.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd Remy Ma for those wins.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye, blacks.\n\n", "keywords": ["awards", "performance", "music", "bet", "songz", "say", "felt", "love", "let", "forever", "song", "entertained", "dont", "chicken"], "polarity": 0.18189406065456484, "subjectivity": 0.5161022287702961},

Blige fan, news of a new album might not necessarily trigger the excitement it used to. Blige has managed to continue to be largely successful through her albums and subsequent tears, but the newer material has often been the equivalent of catfish that you let cool for too long. Like, it\u2019s not bad, and indeed, it\u2019s still nourishing, but you prefer it hotter, like you\u2019re used to.\n\nThankfully, Blige\u2019s most recent release, Strength of a Woman, has me singing \u201cTemperature\u2019s rising \u2026 ,\u201d only not like that pervert you\u2019re now thinking of.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn lieu of a traditional review, here are all of the reasons to love this album and where Blige is going in her career.\n\nShe is mad as all hell.\n\nIn the first 30 seconds of \u201cSet Me Free,\u201d the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul sings: \u201cTell me how you figure that you made me and you gave me what I had before I met ya/Ain\u2019t gon\u2019 have it when you gone?/And how you fix your mouth to say I owe you when you had another bitch and taking trips and shit with my money/You must done lost it/Nigga, you won\u2019t get a dime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J. Blige hates the fuck out of her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. To wit, she also sings on the same song, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for you/You gon\u2019 pay for what you did to me.\u201d While I try to figure out if I can conduct a s\u00e9ance to help Blige get the revenge on her deadweight that she deserves, I am appreciating the anger.\n\nShe sounds current, but not pressed to keep up with the times.\n\nWhat I liked about this album\u2019s first two releases, \u201cThick of It\u201d and \u201cU & Me (Love Sessions),\u201d is that each song sounds current without trying too hard. Not everyone is as successful with similar pursuits. See Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t.\u201d Bless her heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any event, this pattern continues on other tracks, like \u201cIt\u2019s Me\u201d and the instant body-roll-inducing \u201cTelling the Truth,\u201d featuring Kaytranada and BadBadNotGood. However, my favorite example of this is \u201cGlow Up,\u201d featuring DJ Khaled (basically just breathing), Missy Elliott (not first-place verse, but honorable mention is better than a participation award), and the Beyonc\u00e9 of Migos, Quavo. Quavo and Blige are (somewhat) strangely sublime together. I\u2019m surprised that Blige hasn\u2019t recorded with Future yet, but after \u201cGlow Up,\u201d I would not be opposed to more MJB-Quavo collaborations. It is by far my favorite track because it\u2019s basically a fuck-you to Isaacs that you can aggressively bop to in the club.\n\nSpeaking of, with this track and the overall album, Blige sounds like the cool auntie versus that desperate auntie who ferociously tries to prove to all that she\u2019s still got it. Some of us know this auntie: the one who invites herself to the club with you after Thanksgiving dinner. That is not my Mary J. Blige. My Mary J. Blige is the one I can\u2019t wait to bring because this album slaps and I can\u2019t wait to buy her the finest cognac and join her in that same ass dance she does (which is legendary choreography, TBH).\n\nThere are plenty of songs to cry to at the concert.\n\nI cannot wait to join, at the looming tour, the aunties, the gay uncles, the white people who discovered her sometime between the Elton John sample and first hearing of the word \u201cdancerie,\u201d and the straight black men forced to come because they\u2019ve done messed up with their girls once again. Like, I\u2019ve already prepared my frown and sway while holding a cup of cognac to \u201cThank You.\u201d I know I will be waving one hand in the air to \u201cIndestructible\u201d as Blige ministers to the crowd. Depending on the set list, I may shed a tear or 19 to \u201cSurvivor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is her best work in years.\n\nEven on the later Mary J. Blige albums that bring about the same feelings as her older material, there are always a couple of gems on each. That said, Strength of a Woman is her strongest and most cohesive release in years. Obviously, working from a place of scorn and sadness over the failure of her marriage has fueled her, so while I will not thank Isaacs for inspiring her by behaving like the ain\u2019t-shit men she so often sings about, I advise fans to give Blige some sales and streams.\n\nShe needs to handle his ass in court, so we must support our girl. To that end, join me in prayer that she doesn\u2019t have to give Isaacs shit in the divorce settlement.", "keywords": ["legendary", "j", "album", "excellent", "isaacs", "sounds", "brings", "wait", "sings", "blige", "join", "mary", "auntie", "thing", "old"], "polarity": 0.13691540699737423, "subjectivity": 0.5295241643602298},

{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/whats-your-criteria-for-determining-if-an-r-b-singer-ca-1822521539", "title": "/whats-your-criteria-for-determining-if-an-r-b-singer-ca-", "text": "If you were to ask me to list my top five greatest R&B or soul singers of all time, the list would would at different times include any of the following people: Donny Hathaway (he\u2019d always be in the top five as a personal favorite but because he is one of two people whose voice ever made me cry), Phyllis Hyman (the other), Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke, Teddy Pendergrass, Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, Mariah Carey, Minnie Riperton. Expanding it to 10 would include them all and they\u2019re all immediately in the top 20.\n\nOne thing that all of the listed singers have in common is this: if any of them walked into your church right now (I know that all but two of them are dead, literally heavenly voices at this point), the pastor or whoever is running the service that day would absolutely invite them up to sing a song for the church and not one person would object. In fact, you\u2019d almost EXPECT them to know that if they came into your church, they'd be singing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, that list of individuals at the top is a top shelf list of singers who are historically regarded in such a light, but that number is super expansive. For instance, Monica, Faith Evans, R. Kelly (I know, I know), K-Ci and JoJo Hailey, Sisqo, even the Casey brothers from Jagged Edge, would be on a very long list of singers who could come into your church and sing. Beyonce, Kelly, etc.\n\nOn the FLIPSIDE, there is an ever expanding list of singers, or people who have made their living as such who absolutely would not get that same ask. Nobody in New Edition but Johnny, 112, Total, (whereas everybody in Xscape could come sing at the altar), Rihanna, Kyle from Jagged Edge, DeVante, etc. would be asked to come to the front of the church to sing. Mary J. Blige, for all of her musical contributions to the world should absolutely not be singing church solos. And I like Mary, I will fight you over both My Life and Share My World, but while she sings, she\u2019s not necessary a singer.\n\nThe truth is, a lot of these artists are more vocalists than singers. They\u2019re Axl Rose. You\u2019d never put Whitney and Mary on the same level; or Marvin and Trey Songz. Those who are vocalists are very good at what they do - they typically have the hits to show for it - but to say they are singers overstates their talents. Shit, sometimes their talent is existing (see Fenty, Robyn). And that\u2019s not to sell Rihanna short, because she has matured into a full fledged artist at this point and we're all better for it, and I\u2019d even argue is part of the reason why Beyonce has become so much more of an artist than just singer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd oh John the Rabbit, oh yes, Beyonce is absolutely a singer. Nobody who hears songs like \"Dangerously In Love\" and says she can\u2019t sing should be allowed to offer critical commentary on vocal abilities.\n\nNow, I will acknowledge that my church criteria might be high; however, for the most part, when I listen to gospel music, every lead can sing in a way that I think most people would agree with. There are very few slum singers that make it out of the church. Now, that isn\u2019t to say that all church singers are good. I\u2019m not trying to throw rocks here, but I come from a church where there was definitely a Struggle Choir, but it also wasn\u2019t a church that focused heavily on the choirs. I led the Youth Choir for a bit, before being unceremoniously unseated due to my, hmm, attempts to push us into Baptist territory that was frowned upon by the more conservative members of my United Methodist church. I promise you though, I definitely did Milly Rock down the aisle before that was a thing. It was my last Sunday leading the choir. My desire to sing Old Negro Spirituals because I really liked dropping my voice extra low was also frowned upon. My tenure was frowned upon.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand, on Facebook last night I wrote this:\n\nI love writing about music for VSB. And not about what's hot now, but throwback music articles because it starts so many random debates and dialogues. Music is the most subjective topic that we all swear we're objective about. Every opinion is fact and I'm here for all the shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, what other art form does a poet who can't sing, dance, or play an instrument get to call himself Musiq and everybody is like, \"cool, I'll buy that album.\"\n\nMusic is life.\n\nWith that said, I'm always right.\n\nTwo things of note here: 1) I\u2019m definitely not always right, but I felt like there was no better place to drop that hammer than in a place where I point out that every opinion is fact in conversations where everybody swears they\u2019re being objective about intentionally subjective material. 2) I didn\u2019t think musiq soulchild would be a point of contention, mostly because I didn\u2019t realize that people think he can sing. I kind of always assumed we all just accepted that he was a SUPREMELY talented songwriter who could craft a hit who wasn\u2019t the best singer. He\u2019s not a Minister at the Church of Struggle Notes Cathedral, but I\u2019d never really be like, \u201cyou know who really holds notes really well? Musiq.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, many people feel otherwise. But that speaks directly to the subjective nature of what makes somebody a good singer. Some people are just not good, no matter what bar you create. The women of Total represent that bag, though, I rather ENJOY the way their vocal were used to craft their songs, I\u2019d just not like to hear Kima, Keisha, or Pam sing solo ever.\n\nBut that church criteria is what I usually fall onto when saying somebody CAN sing. It\u2019s why young Michael Jackson can sing and Janet Jackson - regardless of how much I love her - can\u2019t. Prince is an interesting case, too, because I can\u2019t imagine Prince singing any church songs, but I\u2019m also not going to say he can\u2019t sing either.\n\nHowever, if Stevie walks into your church, you will make sure he makes his way to the keyboard and microphone and pray for his hairline. Coko from SWV could sing in my church any day of the week. Controversially speaking, so could Teairra Mari or Chris Brown. Almost none of my determination has to do with whether or not I like the artists music or not, because in most cases I absolutely do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd praise the lord for Amel Larrieux.\n\nNow I wrote all of this for two reasons: 1) I\u2019m curious about what metrics people use for determining if an artist can \u201csing\u201d or not? And 2) because in the past 7 minutes you spent reading this you could have saved as much as 15 percent by switching to Geico, and you\u2019re right here with me. I appreciate that.\n\nOh, and most importantly, who are your top 5 singers, VSB?

It is by far my favorite track because it\u2019s basically a fuck-you to Isaacs that you can aggressively bop to in the club.\n\nSpeaking of, with this track and the overall album, Blige sounds like the cool auntie versus that desperate auntie who ferociously tries to prove to all that she\u2019s still got it. Some of us know this auntie: the one who invites herself to the club with you after Thanksgiving dinner. That is not my Mary J. Blige. My Mary J. Blige is the one I can\u2019t wait to bring because this album slaps and I can\u2019t wait to buy her the finest cognac and join her in that same ass dance she does (which is legendary choreography, TBH).\n\nThere are plenty of songs to cry to at the concert.\n\nI cannot wait to join, at the looming tour, the aunties, the gay uncles, the white people who discovered her sometime between the Elton John sample and first hearing of the word \u201cdancerie,\u201d and the straight black men forced to come because they\u2019ve done messed up with their girls once again. Like, I\u2019ve already prepared my frown and sway while holding a cup of cognac to \u201cThank You.\u201d I know I will be waving one hand in the air to \u201cIndestructible\u201d as Blige ministers to the crowd. Depending on the set list, I may shed a tear or 19 to \u201cSurvivor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is her best work in years.\n\nEven on the later Mary J. Blige albums that bring about the same feelings as her older material, there are always a couple of gems on each. That said, Strength of a Woman is her strongest and most cohesive release in years. Obviously, working from a place of scorn and sadness over the failure of her marriage has fueled her, so while I will not thank Isaacs for inspiring her by behaving like the ain\u2019t-shit men she so often sings about, I advise fans to give Blige some sales and streams.\n\nShe needs to handle his ass in court, so we must support our girl. To that end, join me in prayer that she doesn\u2019t have to give Isaacs shit in the divorce settlement.", "keywords": ["legendary", "j", "album", "excellent", "isaacs", "sounds", "brings", "wait", "sings", "blige", "join", "mary", "auntie", "thing", "old"], "polarity": 0.13691540699737423, "subjectivity": 0.5295241643602298},

The bill is an amendment to the federal criminal code that makes it a crime for any physician \u201cto knowingly perform an abortion: (1) without determining whether the fetus has a detectable heartbeat, (2) without informing the mother of the results, or (3) after determining that a fetus has a detectable heartbeat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill provides an exception clause for abortions that are necessary \u201cto save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical (but not psychological or emotional) disorder, illness, or condition.\u201d The law is aimed specifically at punishing physicians who perform abortions: A physician found guilty of breaking the law would be subject to criminal penalties that include a fine, five years in prison or both.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Iowa Republican Steve King, who said in January: \u201cSince Roe v. Wade was unconstitutionally decided in 1973, nearly 60 million innocent babies\u2019 lives have been ended by the abortion industry, all with a rubber stamp by the federal government. If a heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected.\u201d\n\nKing also later told reporters, \u201cWe think this bill, properly applied, does eliminate a large, large share of the abortions\u201490 percent or better\u2014of the abortions in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind that this is the same Republican Party that is seeking to make sweeping cuts to social welfare programs. In fact, it was King himself who suggested cutting food stamps to free up money to build Donald Trump\u2019s wall of doom at the Mexican border.\n\nSo King and the GOP want to protect the lives of babies, but not feed them, clothe them, educate them or provide health care for them. Remember, Republicans failed to renew the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nThey just want the children to be born.\n\nSounds legit.\n\nThis is just another attempt to infringe on the reproductive rights of women and to ban abortion entirely. I\u2019m not sure why the GOP is so hell-bent on making this happen\u2014and even if this legislation makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which it likely will, we don\u2019t have much hope for a win there, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if our government only cares about people who are rich, white and male.\n\nRead more at ThinkProgress.", "keywords": ["white", "comeback", "bill", "abortion", "introduction", "health", "federal", "making", "women", "heartbeat", "gop", "coat", "abortions", "king", "hanger"], "polarity": 0.04667277167277167, "subjectivity": 0.44650997150997157},

The Trump administration decided Friday that, effective immediately, any employer can claim a religious or moral objection to providing birth control coverage under its insurance plan.\n\nThe Obamacare mandate that requires birth control to be provided at no cost has been opposed by religious groups and fought in court for more than five years, as Politico notes.\n\nThe administration has published a 100-page document (pdf) in which it writes:\n\nThe United States has a long history of providing conscience protections in the regulation of health care for entities and individuals with objections based on religious beliefs or moral convictions. These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect moral convictions for certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive coverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document notes that the new Trump mandate will not affect other federal programs that \u201cprovide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk of unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe administration claims to be protecting people from being forced to violate their religious beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring and downplaying the fact that this will now make it harder for many women to get access to birth control.\n\nPolitico reports that women\u2019s groups are already moving to counter this change with lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told Politico:\n\nToday\u2019s outrageous rules by the Trump Administration show callous disregard for women\u2019s rights, health, and autonomy. By taking away women\u2019s access to no-cost birth control coverage, the rules give employers a license to discriminate against women. We will take immediate legal steps to block these unfair and discriminatory rules.\n\nIn 2014 the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores that private companies could seek an exemption from providing birth control coverage on religious grounds. Politico found last year that in the time since that ruling, only 52 companies or nonprofits sought to opt out of the birth control requirement based on religion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, women saved $1.4 billion on birth control pills in 2013 because of the mandate, and about 55 million women have benefited directly from no-cost birth control.\n\nThis latest move by the Trump administration will undoubtedly have a ripple effect that affects not just women but America as a whole.\n\nAs the director of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Haywood Brown, told Politico, \u201cAny move to decrease access to these vital services would have damaging effects on public health and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remove access to birth control while simultaneously making cuts to social welfare programs, how do all these children born unintentionally get taken care of?\n\nWhat is the endgame here?\n\nRead more at Politico and read the Trump document here (pdf).", "keywords": ["politico", "birth", "religious", "removes", "control", "administration", "women", "trump", "womens", "health", "cover", "mandate", "obamacare"], "polarity": 0.042842111592111584, "subjectivity": 0.4002585377585377},

It\u2019s probably because we\u2019re so alike\u2014stubborn, unyielding and always right. It\u2019s hard to have a healthy relationship with someone with whom you spend most of your time butting heads. There were times in my life when my mother and I went months without speaking, only coming together again at my father\u2019s insistence or, at times, his tears.\n\nI always figured that once my elderly father passed on, the two of us would simply drift apart, with her two children from a previous marriage standing in to care for her as she aged. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that my decision to have an abortion would lead to a strong, supportive relationship with my mother.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt happened when I was 19. I was attending college (the college chosen for me by my mother, of course), and I was not ready to become a parent. So when I became pregnant, I chose to have a medical abortion and complete my schooling. I also chose not to tell my parents. I paid the bill in cash so that the procedure wouldn\u2019t show up on our insurance statements.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t shame or guilt that compelled me to keep my abortion a secret; it was fear that I would disappoint my parents. Abortion was never taboo in my family. We\u2019re a weekly-church-going Episcopalian and feminist family. My mother was so happy when I took a job with a reproductive-rights organization, and proud that I was defending the right to abortion. But still, I couldn\u2019t tell her that I had one because that meant admitting to premarital sex, and it meant admitting I did something that was not in her life plan for me.\n\nMy parents came to this country from Guyana in the 1970s, laden with expectations of a new future in a new country, dreams they placed squarely upon the shoulders of their children, as most immigrants do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was born, the three of us, along with my Guyanese-born brother and my sister, all lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y. Every penny they earned went to my future.\n\nIt went to private school education, the infinite number of books I wanted to read, international trips to make me well-rounded, piano lessons, ballet lessons, weekend finishing school lessons, and a house in the suburbs with a yard to play in.\n\nHaving a child at 19 would have been the equivalent of returning all these precious gifts and sacrifices to them. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought. They could never know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got the first hint that maybe I should tell my mother when we watched a recording of the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt rally together. People who had had abortions told their stories in front of the Supreme Court, including Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund, a Texas-based abortion fund.\n\nShe talked about how difficult it was to obtain the funds necessary for her abortion in Texas. Williams didn\u2019t tell her parents about her abortion for a long time, but when she eventually shared her story, her mother said, \u201cM\u2019ija, why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would have gone with you.\u201d\n\nWhen we listened to Williams tell that part of her story, my mother did something I only ever saw her do when someone had died: She began to cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that my decision to have an abortion would lead to a strong, supportive relationship with my mother.\ufeff\n\nWe don\u2019t cry, my mother and I. For us, crying was always a sign of weakness. For her to cry in front of me, Williams\u2019 words must have touched her deeply. I opened my mouth and started to tell her that I, too, had had an abortion, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. I just wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nI was ready to tell everyone else, though. I started by co-writing a letter on behalf of people of color who\u2019d had abortions, rebutting the insulting, racist, misogynistic testimony I heard during deliberations on a federal abortion bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWitnesses characterized abortion in the black community as something thrust upon us, instead of something we chose with our own agency. I wanted to stand up and shout, \u201cI am black, and I chose to have an abortion.\u201d But I didn\u2019t. I co-wrote the letter to rebut the insulting testimony and the bill itself. Signing my name to that letter liberated me.\n\nSharing my story felt amazing, so I kept telling it.\n\nFrom the steps of the Supreme Court, I told the crowd at the rally for the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt decision in 2016 that I was a black woman who had had an abortion. I joined We Testify, a leadership program of the National Network of Abortion Funds dedicated to increasing the spectrum of abortion storytellers in the public sphere and shifting the way the media understands the context and complexity of accessing abortion care. And on last year\u2019s anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I shared my story in a national magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, I still hadn\u2019t told my mother.\n\nOut of the blue one evening, she called me. My sister had recently taught her how to use Google, so she did a search of my name and found my We Testify profile. She asked me if I had had an abortion, and I said yes. After a brief pause, her response was, \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nI know there were a million words behind that short response. I waited for her to say something more, and when she didn\u2019t, I asked her how that made her feel. She broke my heart when she said, full of uncharacteristic emotion and sentimentality, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m the worst mother in the world that you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were days growing up when I thought she was the worst mother in the world. She was an incredible provider, but her methods of motivating me or supporting me through tough times were never helpful. It often seemed as though only my father understood and loved me for who I was instead of who I had the potential to be.\n\nIn an instant, I finally understood that my mother\u2019s love for me was deeper than I had perceived it to be. The grave disappointment I expected was nowhere to be found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then I told her everything. I told her how complete my silence had been\u2014that it wasn\u2019t just about her. For years, the only people who knew were my boyfriend and, later, two close friends.\n\nI told her about my medical abortion, what the experience was like and the relief I felt afterward. For the first time, I felt like she truly listened. I think she realized that she may have missed out on a lot in my life because of our dysfunctional relationship. And I realized that my mother has been on my side, whether I knew it or not, all along.\n\nThe way we express our love for each other might not be how the other understands love to be, but we can both say without a doubt that our phone conversation was nothing but mutual love and support.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscussing my abortion with my mother was a positive turning point in our relationship. I sometimes wonder what our relationship would have been like had I told her sooner. But when I do, I try to refocus on the fact that we now have a bond that I always craved. And for that, because of my abortion, I will always be grateful.\n\nKristine A.

NBC News reports that her activism will go even further now in her new role.\n\nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said in an interview with Elle magazine that Rhimes was a natural choice because she is a longtime supporter, she serves on the board in Los Angeles, and Richards felt she brought a valuable perspective.\n\n\u201cBut what she brings not only to this board, but frankly to the world, is her commitment to lift up the stories of people who don\u2019t always get heard, whether it\u2019s in the way she talks about LGBT issues or women\u2019s reproductive health care or [the way she] centers people of color on television,\u201d Richards told Elle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom NBC:\n\nRhimes first dealt with the sensitive topic of abortion in her TV shows on Grey\u2019s Anatomy in 2011 when Cristina Yang, one of the main characters, felt that she could not have a child, because her whole life was dedicated to being the best surgeon she could be. Later, in 2015, Rhimes would go further in her show Scandal with a scene that showed Olivia Pope going through the actual procedure of the abortion, a move that Rhimes did not find all that controversial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhimes said of the scene in Scandal, \u201cI\u2019m constantly having the conversations; I had a lot of conversations when we did that scene in which I tried to explain that just like all the scenes I did on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, in this scene we were portraying a medical procedure that is legal in the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAccording to NBC, both Rhimes and Richards believe that this is a critical time in the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights, especially since the U.S. Senate recently voted to allow states to withhold federal family-planning funds from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers; Vice President Mike Pence made the tiebreaking vote in that decision.\n\nWhile discussing how some of the media portray this as only being a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue,\u201d Rhimes told Elle, \u201cI think the point of our country, our planet, the reason we\u2019re all here, one of the best things that we can do is be concerned about something even when it doesn\u2019t concern us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while abortion is commonly cited as a reason for defunding Planned Parenthood, it is only about 3 percent of the services that the organization provides each year.\n\nFurthermore, an attack on Planned Parenthood is an attack on low-income women and women of color.

It\u2019s a sick look,\u201d she said.\n\nUnderstanding adenomyosis requires you to understand endometriosis. Endometriosis surfaces on the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium), which causes numerous problems, ranging from rectal pain to fatigue. In rare cases, it can even be located behind the eyes, lungs and brain.\n\nAdenomyosis occurs when the endometrial tissue of the womb grows into and within the muscle wall. These conditions are often accompanied by fibroids\u2014something Kat and I have in common\u2014and are three times more likely to occur in black women. In fact, 80-90 percent of black women are expected to develop fibroids by age 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite expressing her concerns to medical professionals, Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 diagnosis didn\u2019t occur until she met with an Irish doctor who ran several in-depth examinations. When she and her partner, photographer Rob Covell, began making plans to expand their family, Fran\u00e7ois quickly realized that her condition had been masked by her use of hormonal contraceptives.\n\nBirth control is a common, temporary remedy prescribed by gynecologists to treat painful menses. While injections reduced her flow for years, without them, she was forced to endure weekslong agonizing pain. When asked to describe a day suffering with adenomyosis, she used the term \u201canimalistic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other way to describe this condition when you are bleeding profusely, puking up like some rabid animal, in pain so badly you want to smash your head in between the walls and turn off the lights,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFran\u00e7ois and I exchanged emotional stories about accidents due to our cycles and how it affected our relationships.

She\u2019d long considered herself \u201cfortunate\u201d for living minutes away from a hospital; a place that became like a second home.

It quite upsets me, but I have to do it. It\u2019s so bad that the only way that I deal with it is to not get emotionally involved with it, which is how I used to be. It would help me decide on whether we need to go to the ER. Now it\u2019s to a point where she can be left in a room when she wants to be left alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I was a woman who was dealing with this by myself, without family or the support of a partner, this might be a different story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFran\u00e7ois runs a motivational Facebook fitness group for adults, where she practices and advocates others to reduce sugar, wheat and processed foods.

People of color, LGBTQ people, undocumented immigrants and those who live at the intersections of these identities navigate a nation that reminds them every day that whether they live or die is not a priority.\n\nThis is not hyperbole; this is fact:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese facts are not just inconvenient statistics; they are manifestations of horrible policies imagined by powerful lobbying firms and approved by local, state and federal legislators who, too often, put their own personal beliefs and political agendas ahead of the needs of their constituents.\n\n\n\n#ScaryStats is about sounding the alarm for black mamas not surviving the birth of their children in a country that spends more per capita on health care than any other nation in the world.\n\nThat is not just scary; it is terrifying. And the Twitter conversation was about shining a light on the struggles faced by women of color and other people living at the margins of power. It was about making it clear that #BlackLivesMatter and that black women are facing a public health crisis. It was intended to amplify the very real harms caused by our broken immigration system and lack of fair workplace policies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, social media trolls committed to proving how morally bankrupt they are were quick to attack. Anti-abortion trolls tried to hijack the conversation in order to shame people for accessing abortion care or supporting abortion access. As is often the case, they were too busy demonizing providers and people who need care to actually consider truly listening to and supporting women.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood Black Community, a forum to lift the specific needs of black women and communities of color and to emphasize the efforts to ensure the health, rights and dignity of black people, became the focus of the Twitter attacks after it shared information about the maternal health crisis that black women in the United States are facing right now.\n\n\n\nAnd, be clear, this is a human rights crisis.\n\nMore black women have died in childbirth this year than from abortion-related complications in the past 15 years combined. Much more needs to be done to protect and expand access to the full range of reproductive health services that black women need\u2014including abortion\u2014and make sure that people are aware that maternal mortality is an issue that needs some very real attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore black women have died in childbirth this year than from abortion-related complications in the past 15 years combined.\n\nSince the truth and facts don\u2019t mean much to many of the people who want to make abortion illegal by any means necessary and regardless of whom it harms, anti-abortion trolls took a tweet from PP Black Community out of context and shared it at a hearing on a six-week and 20-week abortion ban introduced by the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nSee Twitter thread below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also pushed their followers to attack Planned Parenthood with tweets defaming abortion providers and black women for committing \u201cgenocide.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s be very real here:\n\nThe people who troll black women for affirming that abortion is medically safe while uplifting the crisis of maternal mortality in the United States do not care about mothers, babies or families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who rely on doctored quotes and half-truths about a woman who has been dead for 50 years to cut off women\u2019s access to family planning services do not care about mothers, babies or families.\n\n\n\nThe people who advocate for the introduction of six-week and 20-week abortion bans while trying to take away prenatal care, limit access to birth control and get rid of the adoption tax credit do not care about mothers, babies or families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who claim to care about the \u201cunborn\u201d (which is questionable, considering their cuts to maternal health benefits) don\u2019t care about the living, breathing children of color being actively harmed and killed as a result of state-sanctioned violence by the police, ICE and Border Patrol. And they do not care about mothers, babies or families, as shown by their unwillingness to invest in education, housing, transportation and health for all.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to call out their toxic and perverted morality masking as \u201ccare\u201d for what it is: a sham. We have clear data to prove it. Fighting the battle of abortion while starving our communities is immoral and unjust.\n\n\n\nThe best antidote to their scary agenda is to build our collective power. Black women should decide if they are ready to parent and should have the support and the care they need no matter what decision they make. Organizations like Black Mamas Matter Alliance and the Afiya Center are already working to save the lives of black mamas by addressing why black women are dying in childbirth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who claim to care about the \u201cunborn\u201d (which is questionable, considering their cuts to maternal health benefits) don\u2019t care about the living, breathing children of color being actively harmed and killed as a result of state-sanctioned violence by the police, ICE and Border Patrol.\n\nYou see, we have the power to build a world where, in the words of Sister Song, people can \u201cmaintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d free from harm from individuals or the government. That is what reproductive justice is; that is what we are fighting for.\n\n\n\nThat is why we won\u2019t stop.\n\nYou can come at us, but know that we won\u2019t be shamed or harassed into silence.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Birth Equity Collaborative\u2019s mission is to reduce black maternal and infant mortality through research, family-centered collaboration and advocacy.

It\u2019s probably because we\u2019re so alike\u2014stubborn, unyielding and always right. It\u2019s hard to have a healthy relationship with someone with whom you spend most of your time butting heads. There were times in my life when my mother and I went months without speaking, only coming together again at my father\u2019s insistence or, at times, his tears.\n\nI always figured that once my elderly father passed on, the two of us would simply drift apart, with her two children from a previous marriage standing in to care for her as she aged. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that my decision to have an abortion would lead to a strong, supportive relationship with my mother.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt happened when I was 19. I was attending college (the college chosen for me by my mother, of course), and I was not ready to become a parent. So when I became pregnant, I chose to have a medical abortion and complete my schooling. I also chose not to tell my parents. I paid the bill in cash so that the procedure wouldn\u2019t show up on our insurance statements.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t shame or guilt that compelled me to keep my abortion a secret; it was fear that I would disappoint my parents. Abortion was never taboo in my family. We\u2019re a weekly-church-going Episcopalian and feminist family. My mother was so happy when I took a job with a reproductive-rights organization, and proud that I was defending the right to abortion. But still, I couldn\u2019t tell her that I had one because that meant admitting to premarital sex, and it meant admitting I did something that was not in her life plan for me.\n\nMy parents came to this country from Guyana in the 1970s, laden with expectations of a new future in a new country, dreams they placed squarely upon the shoulders of their children, as most immigrants do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was born, the three of us, along with my Guyanese-born brother and my sister, all lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y. Every penny they earned went to my future.\n\nIt went to private school education, the infinite number of books I wanted to read, international trips to make me well-rounded, piano lessons, ballet lessons, weekend finishing school lessons, and a house in the suburbs with a yard to play in.\n\nHaving a child at 19 would have been the equivalent of returning all these precious gifts and sacrifices to them. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought. They could never know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got the first hint that maybe I should tell my mother when we watched a recording of the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt rally together. People who had had abortions told their stories in front of the Supreme Court, including Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund, a Texas-based abortion fund.\n\nShe talked about how difficult it was to obtain the funds necessary for her abortion in Texas. Williams didn\u2019t tell her parents about her abortion for a long time, but when she eventually shared her story, her mother said, \u201cM\u2019ija, why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would have gone with you.\u201d\n\nWhen we listened to Williams tell that part of her story, my mother did something I only ever saw her do when someone had died: She began to cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that my decision to have an abortion would lead to a strong, supportive relationship with my mother.\ufeff\n\nWe don\u2019t cry, my mother and I. For us, crying was always a sign of weakness. For her to cry in front of me, Williams\u2019 words must have touched her deeply. I opened my mouth and started to tell her that I, too, had had an abortion, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. I just wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nI was ready to tell everyone else, though. I started by co-writing a letter on behalf of people of color who\u2019d had abortions, rebutting the insulting, racist, misogynistic testimony I heard during deliberations on a federal abortion bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWitnesses characterized abortion in the black community as something thrust upon us, instead of something we chose with our own agency. I wanted to stand up and shout, \u201cI am black, and I chose to have an abortion.\u201d But I didn\u2019t. I co-wrote the letter to rebut the insulting testimony and the bill itself. Signing my name to that letter liberated me.\n\nSharing my story felt amazing, so I kept telling it.\n\nFrom the steps of the Supreme Court, I told the crowd at the rally for the Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt decision in 2016 that I was a black woman who had had an abortion. I joined We Testify, a leadership program of the National Network of Abortion Funds dedicated to increasing the spectrum of abortion storytellers in the public sphere and shifting the way the media understands the context and complexity of accessing abortion care. And on last year\u2019s anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I shared my story in a national magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, I still hadn\u2019t told my mother.\n\nOut of the blue one evening, she called me. My sister had recently taught her how to use Google, so she did a search of my name and found my We Testify profile. She asked me if I had had an abortion, and I said yes. After a brief pause, her response was, \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nI know there were a million words behind that short response. I waited for her to say something more, and when she didn\u2019t, I asked her how that made her feel. She broke my heart when she said, full of uncharacteristic emotion and sentimentality, \u201cWell, I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m the worst mother in the world that you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were days growing up when I thought she was the worst mother in the world. She was an incredible provider, but her methods of motivating me or supporting me through tough times were never helpful. It often seemed as though only my father understood and loved me for who I was instead of who I had the potential to be.\n\nIn an instant, I finally understood that my mother\u2019s love for me was deeper than I had perceived it to be. The grave disappointment I expected was nowhere to be found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then I told her everything. I told her how complete my silence had been\u2014that it wasn\u2019t just about her. For years, the only people who knew were my boyfriend and, later, two close friends.\n\nI told her about my medical abortion, what the experience was like and the relief I felt afterward. For the first time, I felt like she truly listened. I think she realized that she may have missed out on a lot in my life because of our dysfunctional relationship. And I realized that my mother has been on my side, whether I knew it or not, all along.\n\nThe way we express our love for each other might not be how the other understands love to be, but we can both say without a doubt that our phone conversation was nothing but mutual love and support.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscussing my abortion with my mother was a positive turning point in our relationship. I sometimes wonder what our relationship would have been like had I told her sooner. But when I do, I try to refocus on the fact that we now have a bond that I always craved. And for that, because of my abortion, I will always be grateful.\n\nKristine A.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a person I prefer never to talk about, especially online, but this time I\u2019m making an exception. It appears that no matter what he does wrong, many people, especially \u201cBernie bros,\u201d have been making excuses for him since we were first introduced to the senator in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if Sanders\u2019 promise of tuition-free college through the primaries was based on how quickly progressives defended his positions, no matter how contradictory those views were becoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Sanders has continued to teach me, among other things, is that white saviors will not (and cannot) save a single black person in the U.S. or around the world.\n\n\n\nUnlike many other young black millennials, I never got a tingling sensation when Sanders announced his presidential candidacy two years ago. To be clear, it was hard to ever believe that a then-73-year-old white, cisgender, straight man would ever lead a revolution, especially one that protects and defends marginalized communities\u2014including poor people, LGBTQ individuals, black and brown women, and undocumented folks. It always surprised me when people went so hard for him, as if his role wouldn\u2019t ultimately have been president of the United States, a position from which revolution is impossible by design.\n\nBut lately it\u2019s come to my attention that Sanders\u2019 idea of a revolution was disingenuous at best and pandering at worst.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.bustle.com/p/dear-bernie-bros-explain-to-me-how-sanders-anti-choice-support-makes-him-progressive-53211\n\nRecently, Sanders endorsed Democratic Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello in his bid to oust Republican incumbent Jean Stothert as leader of the largest city in Nebraska. He\u2019s since stood by his decision to support the candidate, even though Mello\u2019s abortion record is questionable and has rightly drawn criticism. Many Democrats, myself included, were outraged over Sanders\u2019 support, despite his noting that such a strategy was one of the few ways the Democrats could take back all 50 states.\n\nThis has me wondering: What, ultimately, is the difference between Democrats and Republicans if we\u2019re both focused on gutting fundamental beliefs merely for political convenience? The person not to ask is Sanders because he\u2019s neither Democrat nor Republican\u2014or he\u2019s both. At this rate, who knows?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMello has some confusing and, at times, contradictory views on reproductive health care that are indeed rooted in his personal anti-choice, Catholic values. On some occasions, he has sided with Planned Parenthood as chair of the state Legislature\u2019s budget committee. But, and perhaps more important, he has also previously co-sponsored a bill requiring physicians performing abortions to tell a woman that an ultrasound is available.\n\n\n\nAlthough it wan\u2019t mandatory that the ultrasound be performed, as the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have reported\u2014which is an important technicality\u2014we know that any similar language serves the purpose of impeding reproductive rights, namely abortion access. In addition, the 2009 bill required abortion providers to position the screen in such a way that it made the ultrasound easily viewable\u2014you know, just in case the pregnant woman wanted to see the fetus inside her?\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Mello voted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, and the next year, he voted to bar health exchanges set up under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act from funding abortion. He has also voted to change a young person\u2019s \u201cparental notification\u201d requirement to \u201cparental consent,\u201d regardless of what we know about the violence that young women who become pregnant often face. This is all important, and not in the ways that many of us may realize.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never been a single-issue voter, but there are certainly issues that matter more than others. One such issue is access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and choice, including access to safe and legal abortions and contraception. To be sure, anti-choice rhetoric is merely a conduit to attacking women and other communities\u2019 bodily autonomy and integrity in other ways. Voting against choice is rarely, if ever, about choice.\n\n\n\nIf we want to see how friendly or hostile policymakers are to people, watch how the policymaker treats the most marginalized, and watch if he or she supports people who behave the same way. We already knew that the Trump administration would attack women and girls (see \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d reinstatement and expansion), but is this where we have arrived? If the options are between supporting a dangerously conservative candidate and a Democratic one with anti-choice values, I\u2019ll take neither.\n\n\n\nSince his defense of Mello, I\u2019ve heard many Sanders supporters (who can\u2019t seem to let go) swear that he\u2019s simply attempting to find a way to win in a red state, and that elected officials don\u2019t have to agree with us 100 percent of the time on each issue because that would create a party divide. That\u2019s interesting, considering what Sanders\u2019 initial appeal was: He was seen as someone unconventional, a person who didn\u2019t appear to be bought out by the wealthy elite. Demanding a revolution is inherently divisive because it calls for ensuring that those without power get it. It\u2019s hypocritical for Sanders to demand a revolution\u2014something outside of the status quo\u2014and then go back to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for political expediency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur history is becoming shorter-lived.\n\n\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, the Democrats are throwing Mello under the bus; after all, it isn\u2019t as if we haven\u2019t supported candidates with nontraditional Democratic principles before. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Democratic National Committee Chair and former U.S. Dept. of Labor Secretary Tom Perez has found a target in Mello and is now using him to play Russian roulette. What does surprise me, however, is who is leading the charge in support of Mello: Sanders, a candidate who mobilized people to rally around economic justice.\n\n\n\nSanders never had me fooled. He has always had a suspect understanding of economic justice anyhow\u2014one that mistook race for being about economics only. That very idea causes an already pervasive white privilege to spill all over the place. But now we know that not only does he have an idea of race as not being a very real factor, but he also has weak gender analysis, despite claiming to espouse empowerment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we want to talk about economic justice, we must talk about how it intersects with reproductive justice. Economic security is interconnected with reproductive justice because people need economic, social and political resources to make healthy decisions about their own bodies\u2014decisions like seeking a provider for an abortion and related care. This is where Sanders\u2019 support of Mello is perhaps most disappointing. A person cannot be for economic justice if he or she is either anti-choice or supports a candidate who is; they are mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\nDuring the election cycle, I made a personal commitment to vote in my reality\u2014that is, one without nondischargeable student loans, canceled consent decrees, a gutted Department of Justice and eroded human rights. Let\u2019s be clear: My position on Sanders has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, for several reasons, the main one being that she, too, lost. Though our gut reaction is to mention her even in relation to matters that are solely about Sanders, I repeat: This is not about her. Not only did Clinton never promise revolution\u2014indeed, much of her history spoke otherwise\u2014she promised good governance. And that\u2019s an altogether different conversation from this one.\n\n\n\nPerhaps we\u2019ll eventually see Sanders for the person he is: the same politician he rallied against. One who uses bodies as political compromises, one whose economics will never include gender and race analyses, and one whose idea of a revolution entails supporting an anti-choice candidate because potentially winning is more important than sticking to fundamental values at the core of our humanity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlas, we\u2019ll continue defending him so that we can get more post offices legislatively created and sponsored by the revolutionary himself.", "keywords": ["candidate", "revolution", "person", "abortion", "bernie", "antichoice", "reproductive", "mello", "sanders", "economic", "justice", "happened"], "polarity": 0.0937909226190476, "subjectivity": 0.4687431795634922},

What about the sanctity of their lives?\n\nAll this posturing, huffing and puffing centered on controlling what a woman does with her body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is, Pence doesn\u2019t care about the lives that come after.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a person I prefer never to talk about, especially online, but this time I\u2019m making an exception. It appears that no matter what he does wrong, many people, especially \u201cBernie bros,\u201d have been making excuses for him since we were first introduced to the senator in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if Sanders\u2019 promise of tuition-free college through the primaries was based on how quickly progressives defended his positions, no matter how contradictory those views were becoming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Sanders has continued to teach me, among other things, is that white saviors will not (and cannot) save a single black person in the U.S. or around the world.\n\n\n\nUnlike many other young black millennials, I never got a tingling sensation when Sanders announced his presidential candidacy two years ago. To be clear, it was hard to ever believe that a then-73-year-old white, cisgender, straight man would ever lead a revolution, especially one that protects and defends marginalized communities\u2014including poor people, LGBTQ individuals, black and brown women, and undocumented folks. It always surprised me when people went so hard for him, as if his role wouldn\u2019t ultimately have been president of the United States, a position from which revolution is impossible by design.\n\nBut lately it\u2019s come to my attention that Sanders\u2019 idea of a revolution was disingenuous at best and pandering at worst.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.bustle.com/p/dear-bernie-bros-explain-to-me-how-sanders-anti-choice-support-makes-him-progressive-53211\n\nRecently, Sanders endorsed Democratic Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello in his bid to oust Republican incumbent Jean Stothert as leader of the largest city in Nebraska. He\u2019s since stood by his decision to support the candidate, even though Mello\u2019s abortion record is questionable and has rightly drawn criticism. Many Democrats, myself included, were outraged over Sanders\u2019 support, despite his noting that such a strategy was one of the few ways the Democrats could take back all 50 states.\n\nThis has me wondering: What, ultimately, is the difference between Democrats and Republicans if we\u2019re both focused on gutting fundamental beliefs merely for political convenience? The person not to ask is Sanders because he\u2019s neither Democrat nor Republican\u2014or he\u2019s both. At this rate, who knows?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMello has some confusing and, at times, contradictory views on reproductive health care that are indeed rooted in his personal anti-choice, Catholic values. On some occasions, he has sided with Planned Parenthood as chair of the state Legislature\u2019s budget committee. But, and perhaps more important, he has also previously co-sponsored a bill requiring physicians performing abortions to tell a woman that an ultrasound is available.\n\n\n\nAlthough it wan\u2019t mandatory that the ultrasound be performed, as the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have reported\u2014which is an important technicality\u2014we know that any similar language serves the purpose of impeding reproductive rights, namely abortion access. In addition, the 2009 bill required abortion providers to position the screen in such a way that it made the ultrasound easily viewable\u2014you know, just in case the pregnant woman wanted to see the fetus inside her?\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Mello voted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, and the next year, he voted to bar health exchanges set up under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act from funding abortion. He has also voted to change a young person\u2019s \u201cparental notification\u201d requirement to \u201cparental consent,\u201d regardless of what we know about the violence that young women who become pregnant often face. This is all important, and not in the ways that many of us may realize.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never been a single-issue voter, but there are certainly issues that matter more than others. One such issue is access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and choice, including access to safe and legal abortions and contraception. To be sure, anti-choice rhetoric is merely a conduit to attacking women and other communities\u2019 bodily autonomy and integrity in other ways. Voting against choice is rarely, if ever, about choice.\n\n\n\nIf we want to see how friendly or hostile policymakers are to people, watch how the policymaker treats the most marginalized, and watch if he or she supports people who behave the same way. We already knew that the Trump administration would attack women and girls (see \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d reinstatement and expansion), but is this where we have arrived? If the options are between supporting a dangerously conservative candidate and a Democratic one with anti-choice values, I\u2019ll take neither.\n\n\n\nSince his defense of Mello, I\u2019ve heard many Sanders supporters (who can\u2019t seem to let go) swear that he\u2019s simply attempting to find a way to win in a red state, and that elected officials don\u2019t have to agree with us 100 percent of the time on each issue because that would create a party divide. That\u2019s interesting, considering what Sanders\u2019 initial appeal was: He was seen as someone unconventional, a person who didn\u2019t appear to be bought out by the wealthy elite. Demanding a revolution is inherently divisive because it calls for ensuring that those without power get it. It\u2019s hypocritical for Sanders to demand a revolution\u2014something outside of the status quo\u2014and then go back to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for political expediency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur history is becoming shorter-lived.\n\n\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, the Democrats are throwing Mello under the bus; after all, it isn\u2019t as if we haven\u2019t supported candidates with nontraditional Democratic principles before. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Democratic National Committee Chair and former U.S. Dept. of Labor Secretary Tom Perez has found a target in Mello and is now using him to play Russian roulette. What does surprise me, however, is who is leading the charge in support of Mello: Sanders, a candidate who mobilized people to rally around economic justice.\n\n\n\nSanders never had me fooled. He has always had a suspect understanding of economic justice anyhow\u2014one that mistook race for being about economics only. That very idea causes an already pervasive white privilege to spill all over the place. But now we know that not only does he have an idea of race as not being a very real factor, but he also has weak gender analysis, despite claiming to espouse empowerment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we want to talk about economic justice, we must talk about how it intersects with reproductive justice. Economic security is interconnected with reproductive justice because people need economic, social and political resources to make healthy decisions about their own bodies\u2014decisions like seeking a provider for an abortion and related care. This is where Sanders\u2019 support of Mello is perhaps most disappointing. A person cannot be for economic justice if he or she is either anti-choice or supports a candidate who is; they are mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\nDuring the election cycle, I made a personal commitment to vote in my reality\u2014that is, one without nondischargeable student loans, canceled consent decrees, a gutted Department of Justice and eroded human rights. Let\u2019s be clear: My position on Sanders has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, for several reasons, the main one being that she, too, lost. Though our gut reaction is to mention her even in relation to matters that are solely about Sanders, I repeat: This is not about her. Not only did Clinton never promise revolution\u2014indeed, much of her history spoke otherwise\u2014she promised good governance. And that\u2019s an altogether different conversation from this one.\n\n\n\nPerhaps we\u2019ll eventually see Sanders for the person he is: the same politician he rallied against. One who uses bodies as political compromises, one whose economics will never include gender and race analyses, and one whose idea of a revolution entails supporting an anti-choice candidate because potentially winning is more important than sticking to fundamental values at the core of our humanity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlas, we\u2019ll continue defending him so that we can get more post offices legislatively created and sponsored by the revolutionary himself.", "keywords": ["candidate", "revolution", "person", "abortion", "bernie", "antichoice", "reproductive", "mello", "sanders", "economic", "justice", "happened"], "polarity": 0.0937909226190476, "subjectivity": 0.4687431795634922},

But for black women, how they are treated\u2014and not treated\u2014for reproductive-health pain resonates deeply with historic roots in slavery and brutality.\n\n\n\nA new study from the University of Virginia shows a proven racial bias in how medical providers assess black patients\u2019 complaints of pain, guaranteeing that medical providers consistently undertreat black patients and ignore their symptoms.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that some physicians\u2014all of whom take the Hippocratic oath, promising to refrain from \u201ctherapeutic nihilism\u201d and instead to treat patients with \u201cwarmth, sympathy and understanding\u201d\u2014may break this sacred commitment.\n\n\n\nFor women, specifically, this can mean symptoms of pain connected to their reproductive health are routinely ignored or dismissed by their doctors and medical-care providers.\n\n\n\nFor instance, endometriosis is diagnosed as 33 percent more prominent in white women than in women of color. Endometriosis affects 176 million women worldwide and approximately 2-10 percent of American women between ages 25 and 40.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are several issues associated with diagnosing and treating endometriosis among African-American women and other women of color. It takes an average of six to 10 years to diagnose from the onset of symptoms.\n\n\n\nBlack women who present with symptoms of endometriosis are often misdiagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease\u2014a condition that is sexually transmitted. Research on the illness in black women and other women of color is limited.\n\n\n\nA doctor can only make an accurate diagnosis through laparoscopic surgery\u2014a procedure that insurance companies consider elective. The decision to move forward with this surgery lies in the doctor\u2019s validation of the patient\u2019s complaints of pain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my own recent annual exam, the medical provider asked me a barrage of questions listed on her laptop computer:\n\n\u201cAre you currently employed?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a postdoctoral fellow and I teach at Brown University.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you teach?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do research on environmental issues and their impact on the reproductive health of women of color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer response: \u201cBlack women don\u2019t care about their bodies.\u201d\n\nThe provider saw me simply as a black body and interacted with me through the racist ascriptions she held about black women. The fact is, I was seeking preventive health care because I care about my body.\n\nToday it is imperative that in 2017 a patient can experience her most vulnerable moment and be respected and valued. No matter who she is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTragically, the wedded relationship between history, medicine and science provides us with evidence of the racial undertones associated with the validation process of pain. It is a legacy that must end.\n\nAs slaveholders and U.S. political leaders sought to justify the institutionalization of chattel slavery in the 19th century and establish the normativity of the black body as property in person, they turned to the scientific community to produce evidence that would substantiate this initiative.\n\nVeiled in secrecy and protected under the pretext of \u201cobjective\u201d scientific pursuit, scientists engaged in a racially biased research agenda that gave birth to biological and environmental determinism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe narrator in Colson Whitehead\u2019s The Underground Railroad (pdf), which just this week earned Whitehead the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, highlights this issue when depicting Ajarry\u2019s experiences as a female slave: \u201cThe trader called upon the tobacco plantation looking for slaves of breeding age, preferably with all their teeth and of pliable disposition. She was a woman now. Off she went. She knew that the white man\u2019s scientists peered beneath things to understand how they worked.\u201d\n\nUnder this banner of knowledge production, elite white male scientists deemed African Americans as a collective biologically and morally inferior to whites.\n\nIn 1851, Dr. Samuel Cartwright published \u201cDiseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race,\u201d asserting that black skin embodied \u201cpartial insensibility\u201d that gave them a higher threshold for pain and made blacks suited for enslavement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis flagship of ascribed moral depravity and insentience onto the black body ushered in the branch of medicine in obstetrics and gynecology during the 19th century. It is when the womb of the black female slave served as the unbridled space for experimentation on women\u2019s diseases.\n\n\n\nUndermedicated and unprotected, the black female slave\u2019s body functioned as the laboratory and surgical specimen for white male doctors such as Dr. J. Marion Sims (pdf), who in the mid-19th century built his career as \u201cthe father of gynecology.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe had unfettered access to these women\u2019s most sacred inner sanctum, free from any moral, political or economic recourse. He routinely used black women as guinea pigs for experimental surgeries without anesthesia and owned female slaves for the sole purpose of operating on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, Sims administered anesthesia to examine a white female patient of high social status who suffered from a phobia of vaginal penetration. Sims even refused his peers\u2019 recommendations for surgical intervention in this case, stating, \u201cThey seized on the idea and insisted on the operation, which I declined to perform, on the ground that an untried process was not justifiable on one in her position in social life, the Hospital being the legitimate field for experimental observation.\u201d\n\nAlthough history venerates Sims, the social customs and laws worked in tandem to historically silence the very bodies that transformed his career. The social customs prescribed under the Cult of True Womanhood in the 19th century argued that women belonged in the private sphere in order to protect their piety, purity and fragility, according to findings from a researcher at St. Cloud State University.\n\nThese structural mechanisms thus doubly disenfranchised black slave women and excluded them from shaping the conversations around their reproductive health. In the 20th and 21st centuries, we have witnessed the continuance and transference in the silencing of the black body partly in the name of medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his 1982 lecture (pdf), Harvard University zoologist and author R.C. Lewontin critiqued this form of biological determinism when he stated, \u201cIt follows from such a reductionist view that improvements in the general level of psychic and material welfare of society as a whole can come only by changing the mix of individuals that make it up. That is, general social amelioration can come only from eugenic measures.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Lewontin reaffirmed this critique when he asserted, \u201c \u2026 race and racial categorizations serve a very important social function, namely, they justify the inequalities that exist in a society which is said to be based on equality.\u201d\n\nToday it is imperative that in 2017 a patient can experience her most vulnerable moment and be respected and valued. No matter who she is. With President Donald Trump on Thursday signing legislation that allows states to withhold federal dollars from Planned Parenthood, the threat to the health needs of all women is fierce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need to ask and answer poignant questions on how the racialized and gendered biases of medical providers and those in the scientific community contribute to the improper treatment of black women and other women of color when it comes to reproductive-health illnesses.\n\n\n\nIt is a painful issue, to be sure, but enough is enough.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["white", "female", "listen", "women", "pain", "color", "body", "health", "social", "sims", "black"], "polarity": 0.018124398749398758, "subjectivity": 0.3549116495644273},

I don\u2019t engage in it, because I am a moody bitch who does not want to be bothered, much less touched, during my period. The crazy part is that I am also the horniest during my period, and I can\u2019t be the only one this happens to, so that could explain why this is a thing.\n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider when engaging in period sex. There are safety, comfort and cleanliness issues to take into consideration, but as long as you go into it armed with useful information, you can create a pleasurable experience for both partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSafety is key.\n\nThe No. 1 thing to consider when having period sex is the safety and health of you and your partner. Dr. Ruth Ann Crystal and Dr. Diane J. Horvath-Cosper, both gynecologists, caution that menstrual blood can carry infections like HIV and hepatitis B.\n\n\u201cThe cervix is slightly more open during your period, so it may make it easier to get an STI [sexually transmitted infection],\u201d Crystal said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf a person is trying to reduce their risk of sexually transmitted infection, it\u2019s important to use barrier methods [condoms, dental dams] ALL the time, including during menstruation. It\u2019s also important to note that menstruation isn\u2019t a contraceptive method. While it\u2019s unlikely that someone could become pregnant during a period, it\u2019s not impossible. and care should be taken if pregnancy isn\u2019t desired,\u201d Horvath-Cosper said.\n\nOnce you have taken all the necessary safety precautions, getting down to the actual act can also take some preparation.\n\nThe logistics of period sex.\n\nObviously, we all know that period sex can be very messy. No one wants to mess up their sheets, bedding or mattress, so at the minimum, it is advised that you put a dark towel down to prevent staining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexologist and founder of the Women of Color Sexual Health Network Bianca Laureano suggests using tampons for other sorts of play and removing them for penetrative action.\n\nFor oral sex, she suggests using plastic wrap.\n\n\u201cCut off a big piece and lay the center on top of the vulva and let it sit there, taking in some of the body heat,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly, with one finger or something else, start at the mons where the hair grows under the belly button and gently bring the finger down the center of the vulva to hold the [plastic] wrap in place, then gently allow it to go into the folds and layers of the vulva for fuller and more enjoyable use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaureano says that the great thing about plastic wrap \u201cis you can use it whenever you want, and since it\u2019s not latex, you can put things that are oil-based on it without issue, such as hot fudge, massage oil, etc. This will elevate your safer-sex game.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests using gloves.\n\n\u201cIf you purchase them at tattoo suppliers, they are in various forms of rubber for those who have latex allergies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also come in different colors, and for some of us, nothing is hotter than a black glove being put on and the snap of the latex at the wrist! Give it a try. If all else fails, go to the beauty-supply store or dollar store and get gloves there; even the ones that come in the hair-dye box work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, she cautions about the aesthetics of scent and the heaviness of the menstrual flow.\n\n\u201cBe aware of your flow and your scent and be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you may not be aware of your scent, and you got to be open to your partners sharing if they are into it or not. If they are not, be ready to consider ways to remedy the situation for optimal outcomes, like showering\u2014together or solo; being \u2018cleaned up\u2019 by your lover, etc. Scent is a big thing for many of us who have this sensation, and we got to be ready to discuss this so if it does occur, we don\u2019t feel more hurt than need be. Sex is messy and smelly!\u201d\n\nSome suggest that there are benefits to period sex.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that period sex can actually lessen the pain of cramps, and this was corroborated by sexpert Michelle Hope of the O School. She had the following to say on the topic:\n\nThere are actually some benefits to period sex! For starters, there is some connection between orgasm and cramp relief. When we orgasm, our brain releases endorphins, which have been proven to change your mood and take you to a happy place! It is super cool that period sex can help with those pesky cramps because when we climax, our uterine muscles release chemicals to the brain that brings about natural pain relief. Additionally, during our periods, there is an increase in blood flow to the nether regions. That increased blood flow naturally happens when we are aroused, so being on your period is kinda like being a couple steps closer to orgasm even before you start getting frisky!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there any reasons a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex on her period?\n\nI asked Horvath-Cosper if there was any reason a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex during her period. The short answer was no.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe only reason to refrain from sex during a period is if you don\u2019t feel like having sex during your period. There\u2019s nothing weird, wrong or gross about period sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome people ... notice increased sex drive and better lubrication. All the other things that can make oral, vaginal and anal sex enjoyable\u2014closeness with your partner, pleasurable physical sensations, post-orgasm relaxation\u2014are still there during a period.

According to the Colt 45 Book of Negro World Records, the worst dragging in the history of black America took place on June 3, 1986, at Shenandoah Baptist Church when Pastor Julius Franklin III preached an entire sermon about Sister Patrice bringing a Walmart pound cake to a church potluck.\n\nIf you doubt the dragging ability of a black Baptist preacher, ask America\u2019s vice racist and one of the most earnest-looking motherfuckers who ever lived, Mike Pence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to WUSA, Mike Pence decided to attend a Metropolitan Baptist Church in Prince George County, Md., for Martin Luther King Jr. Day service. Apparently, Pence has no black people on his staff or in his circle of friends because one of them would probably have told him that going to the historically black church founded the year after the creation of the Emancipation Proclamation was probably a bad idea.\n\nPastor Maurice Watson, fresh out of fucks to give, noted that some of his parishioners were from Africa and Haiti and said he felt \u201cled by God\u201d to address the subject, which was clue No. 2 for Pence (he should\u2019ve left then; whenever anyone in a black church says they have been \u201cled by God\u201d or \u201cmoved by the Spirit,\u201d the shit is about to go down).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatson pulled out the big-scoring Scrabble words to describe Trump\u2019s \u201calleged\u201d remarks, describing them as \u201cvisceral, guttural and dehumanizing.\u201d I have to admit that I thought he was speaking in tongues until I looked up the definitions.\n\n\u201cI stand here to vehemently denounce the characterizations of the nations in Africa,\u201d Watson said, breaking \u201cvehemently\u201d down into no less than 23 syllables. \u201cAnd whoever said it is wrong, and they ought to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers of the audience said that Pence turned \u201cvisibly red-faced\u201d at certain parts of the speech but did not object in any way, presumably because he knows there are some ass whippings even God himself can\u2019t save you from. I don\u2019t know this definitively, but I\u2019m sure at least one person in the audience would have gladly tested Pence\u2019s adherence to King\u2019s principles by offering the vice president the chance to nonviolently resist \u201cdeez hands\u201d in the church parking lot.\n\nWe can neither confirm nor deny that people were disturbed when Pence was afraid that turning to his neighbor and repeating after the pastor could lead to a dangerous neighbor-coveting sin situation. Plus, he would never look a black person in the eye.\n\nAfter the service, Pence exited quietly and went back to the vice presidential residence to resume his post-impeachment plans for torturing the LGBTQ community. When asked why his face turned the color of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, the veep did not say, \u201cIt must have been the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at WUSA.", "keywords": ["vehemently", "baptist", "remarks", "went", "mlk", "shithole", "service", "pence", "turned", "god", "mike", "watson", "wusa", "words", "church", "vice", "preacher", "red", "black"], "polarity": -0.07514329805996472, "subjectivity": 0.5114748677248678},

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["subtweet", "sing", "michael", "charges", "pence", "pleaded", "guilty", "responds", "lying", "russian", "statement", "trump", "times", "releases", "pleading", "flynn", "james"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

Civil rights leader, organizer and activist Bayard Rustin publicly repudiated the leaders of the Black Campus Movement\u2014a struggle waged by black college students to reform higher education\u2014and implored college officials to \u201cstop capitulating to the stupid demands of Negro students.\u201d You can peer into the life of many a lauded hero and find a few contradictions that are difficult to reconcile.\n\nSo in the spirit of realistic approaches to our more complex and notable Negroes, it\u2019s time to broach another sobering aspect of black history: Jackie Robinson was kind of an opp, and he made some political moves that today would illicit a lot of ire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch an assessment may seem blasphemous, as we are used to seeing depictions of Jackie Robinson as a brave and brilliantly gifted athlete tasked with the enormous burden of being the first black professional baseball player and ultimately a de facto representative of his race, the symbolic promise of integration and a significant figure in the civil rights movement. Those things are true.\n\nWhat\u2019s also true is that, well ... his position and visibility were often weaponized by influential white people to publicly demonize and chastise black radicals and assure the white public that such politics did not reflect the will and morals of the black community.\n\n\n\nIn April 1949, when the Cold War began to intensify, actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson traveled to France to attend the Soviet Union-sponsored Paris Peace Conference. After singing \u201cJoe Hill,\u201d Robeson addressed the audience and offered some impromptu words about the lives of black people in the United States, as he often did. Robeson\u2019s aim was to stress that World War III was not inevitable, as many Americans did not want war with the Soviet Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he took the stage, however, his speech had somehow already been transcribed and dispatched to the United States by the Associated Press. By the following day, editorialists and politicians had branded Robeson a Communist traitor for insinuating that black Americans would not fight in a war against the Soviet Union. Historians would later discover that Robeson had been misquoted, but the damage was almost instantly done, and because he was out of the country, the singer was unaware of the firestorm brewing back home over the speech.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end for Robeson, who would soon be declared \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s voice of America\u201d by a witness at hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee. At this hearing, committee Chair John Wood, a Georgia Democrat, summoned baseball great Jackie Robinson to Washington to testify before HUAC for the purpose of implicating Robeson as a Communist (which he was) and obliterating Robeson\u2019s leadership role in the American black community.\n\nIn his testimony, Robinson assured Americans that Robeson did not speak for all blacks with his \u201csilly\u201d personal views. Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt noted, \u201cMr. Robeson does his people great harm in trying to line them up on the Communist side of [the] political picture. Jackie Robinson helps them greatly by his forthright statements.\u201d This was especially hard for Robeson, as he was one of Robinson\u2019s most ardent and vocal advocates and once called for boycotts of Yankee Stadium as a response to baseball\u2019s lack of integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a later statement, Robinson asserted, \u201cThe fact that because it is a Communist who denounces injustice in the courts, police brutality and lynching, when it happens, doesn\u2019t change the truth of his charges.\u201d Racial discrimination, Robinson said, is not \u201ca creation of Communist imagination.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash against Robeson was immediate. His blacklisting and the revocation of his passport rendered him unable to work or travel, and he saw his yearly income drop from more than $150,000 to less than $3,000. Robeson\u2019s name was stricken from the college All-America football teams. Newsreel footage of him was destroyed, recordings were erased and there was a clear effort in the media to avoid any mention of his name.\n\nRobeson refused to be drawn into a personal feud with Robinson because \u201cto do that would be exactly what the other group wants us to do.\u201d In 1960, Robinson would come to endorse HUAC member Richard Nixon in his presidential bid only to withdraw his support in 1968, furious over Nixon\u2019s courtship of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who had once led the segregationist Dixiecrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson did, however, reprise his role as the Negro defuser, once again using his visibility and influence to be an ardent opponent to the threat of black radicalism in a heated public fued with Malcolm X, and for much of 1963 and part of 1964, Robinson was one of Malcolm X\u2019s most vocal critics, and Malcolm one of his.\n\nJackie struck the first blow, condemning Malcolm\u2019s separatist views in a column for the Chicago Public Defender and igniting a volatile public fallout that even involved threats of physical harm (on Malcolm\u2019s part). Robinson often passionately cited Malcolm and the Nation of Islam as viable threats to the civil rights movement, and Robinson later went on record to condemn riots and any other acts of violence and to publicly criticize Muhammad Ali\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, claiming, \u201cHe\u2019s not willing to show his appreciation to a country that\u2019s giving him, in my view, a fantastic opportunity.\u201d\n\nToward the end of his life, Jackie Robinson had a chance to reflect on some of his political choices.

Instead, they complained to other NBC staffers about the message, including the Roots\u2019 manager Keith McPhee. The next day they were called into separate meetings in the human resources department.

There is a stipulation in his vice presidential contract that requires him to do fuckboy shit on command and at the leisure of the president. And make no mistake about it: Having the vice president fly from Las Vegas\u2014where he was supposedly honoring the victims of the recent despicable mass shooting that took more than 50 lives\u2014to Indiana in order to stage preplanned faux outrage over players kneeling during the national anthem at the Indianapolis Colts-San Francisco 49ers game might make him the national spokesperson for fuckboys.\n\nSo every hot take that you\u2019ve read since the planned protest by the vice president that criticizes his foolishness is right. All of them. And the right is doing a bang-up job in making the argument about the flag, no matter how much those on the left, those protesting and those writing consistently have explained that kneeling during the anthem has nothing to do with patriotism. When the president is the king of selective hearing loss, it\u2019s only right that his second-in-command be willing to turn off his hearing when told to.\n\nThe president and Pence know exactly what they\u2019re doing.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["action", "problem", "missing", "chasemarshall", "black", "hiring", "talent", "simply", "designer", "industry", "designers", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

A group of college students in Ohio are the latest in the nation to accuse a dining establish of racial discrimination, or some sort of profiling, after a manager demanded that they pay for their meal up front because, you know, \u201cyou people steal.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Vindicator, a local newspaper, Youngstown State University student Samora Savage was with friends and classmates when they decided to go to the Royal Grill Buffet in Boardman. The group were asked to pay before they were allowed to be seated. Savage and her friends agreed to pay, but then noticed something was not quite right after she realized that other customers weren\u2019t asked to do the same.\n\nSavage asked the manager about the discrepancy, only for the manager to respond, \u201cYou people steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the way we were treated there,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nAnother diner who noticed the disagreement reportedly got involved and began shouting at the manager about the discriminatory behavior. But the manager, Jay Dong, apparently has no shame in his stance, and insists that his policies are not racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDong told the site that he makes some people pay up front, acknowledging that more often than not those customers are black, but notes that he does not think it\u2019s discrimination because he does not make all of his black customers pay first. So naturally that makes it all better.\n\nHe said that it was a policy he usually uses for people he does not know, or when it\u2019s a big group of people who plan to pay for separate checks.\n\n\u201cA lot of people steal from me.

But if they all pay separate and they run out, I can\u2019t catch everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDong is not a stupid man and is clearly all about his coin, because when asked why he just didn\u2019t make it a policy for everyone, he said that he has tried in the past, only to receive complaints from customers and lose business.\n\nBut apparently that was not enough to induce him to cut out the practice when it comes to \u201ccertain\u201d (aka black) customers.", "keywords": ["asked", "report", "group", "does", "pay", "told", "say", "know", "usually", "ohio", "meal", "demanded", "manager", "steal", "students", "customers", "restaurant", "black"], "polarity": 0.061858974358974354, "subjectivity": 0.44642857142857145},

It is unclear who\u2019s responsible for posting the flyers, which were spotted on the New Jersey campus Monday, but they came in two varieties: the first, a personal attack against a Jewish resident of the city of Princeton; the second, an advertisement for a fake course at the university called, \u201cIntroduction to White Studies: White Guilt and Reparations.\u201d\n\nThe personal attack, titled \u201cThe Truth About \u2018White Privilege\u2019 and Jewish Supremacy,\u201d targets Linda Oppenheim. According to Forward, Oppenheim has worked on racial and justice issues in Princeton and has specifically promoted more pathways for racial inclusivity within the Jewish community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoever targeted Oppenheim was familiar with her work and sought to discredit her.\n\nThe flyer, which the Daily Princetonian showcases in full, appears as one might expect\u2014littered with grammatical errors and lies, like the claim that 70 percent of the sexual predators who have been exposed in recent weeks are Jewish.\n\nAnd while your [sic] at it Linda, why don\u2019t you tell all your pet negroes about the overwhelming Jewish role in the trans-atlantic slave trade. Also you might want to discuss why Israel is deporting 60,000 black African jews from the Jewish state. Diversity and multi-culturalism is only for America and not the chosen people, Linda?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Princetonian notes, the person or people responsible for posting the second poster, advertising the fake Princeton course, appear to be well-acquainted with Princeton-specific academic language and coding.\n\nThe fake course advertisement is meant to mock Princeton\u2019s liberal sensibilities. In describing the course, the poster states that it\u2019s time to \u201cexamine the oppressor society, to study Whites the way they have studied colonized people for decades.\u201d The flyer lists the course as \u201cYTS 305/WHS 201 (SA),\u201d which is consistent with Princeton\u2019s course coding, and lists homework as \u201cWeekly Blackboard Posts and Weekly Reparations.\u201d (I mean, it honestly doesn\u2019t sound like a terrible course.)\n\nFor the past year, racist, anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic flyers have been flooding America\u2019s college campuses.

Perhaps it\u2019s because he\u2019s currently on his 27th vacation of the last three months, and there\u2019s no dry snitches left to fire for outing cocksucking contortionists to the New Yorker. But don\u2019t fret. Something will happen soon\u2014perhaps he\u2019ll tweet that homosexuals are banned from driving Dodge Challengers\u2014and we\u2019ll be reminded that our country is being led by the World\u2019s Strongest Case Against White Privilege Ever.\n\nI wrote the preceding paragraph yesterday afternoon before saving it in drafts to finish today because I had something to do. And then, as soon as I hit save, I checked Twitter and saw that we\u2019re perhaps a misspelled tweet away from nuclear war, which made me feel like some Trump-sensitive spyware read that paragraph and said \u201cLOLOLOL SLOW WEEK I\u2019M GONNA SHOW YOU.\u201d His presidency has truly been the gift that keeps on giving. And that gift is a Groupon for a bag of flaccid possum dicks left on your doorstep every day.\n\nFortunately, Trump has been so terrible, so criminal and so capital-letter White that there\u2019s a chance he may not see the end of his term. Perhaps he\u2019ll get impeached. Perhaps he\u2019ll get indicted. Perhaps he\u2019ll get stabbed to death by a dancer at Stadium Club in Washington, D.C. Either way, President Pence isn\u2019t that farfetched an idea.\n\nThe tenuousness of Trump\u2019s grip on the presidency and the inevitability of Pence taking his place has been a thing people talk about since Pence became Trump\u2019s running mate. And it\u2019s often acknowledged that as bad as Trump is, Pence would be even worse. Because sentient urinal cake dipped in holy water Mike Pence is (actually) smart, (possibly) insane and (definitely) evil. And would have the patience, the politics and the wherewithal to actually get shit done.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Richard Cohen recently devoted an entire column to the question of who would be worse:\n\nSo now Pence stands to Trump\u2019s side, his head nodding at every inanity. He is the cardboard cutout for a soulless and opportunistic Republican Party, a display to put in the window of some Trump souvenir shop. In a sense, he is worse than the man he serves. Trump is a child \u2014 undisciplined, capricious and self-involved. Pence is none of those things. Trump knows nothing. Pence knows better. So who would be worse? To me, this is like the Iran-Iraq War. I cannot pick a side and, to my relief, I don\u2019t have to. But if I were Trump, I\u2019d keep an eye on that nodding head over my shoulder. Pence professes loyalty to Trump, but when it comes to principles, he\u2019s not even loyal to himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer, of course, is Donald Trump. Because while Trump is a man with a 7-year-old\u2019s brain trapped inside a 96-year-old Stay Puft Marshmallow Man\u2019s body, his most redeeming quality\u2014perhaps his only redeeming quality\u2014is that he\u2019s still able to mobilize and excite his base and is such a force of personality that people have chosen to follow him. People give a fuck about Donald Trump.\n\nSadly, no one gives any fucks about Mike Pence. If Trump is still able to hold rallies with thousands of people in packed stadiums and auditoriums, Pence could hold rallies filled with all the fucks people don\u2019t give about him. It\u2019d be an orgy of fuck deficiency. A bacchanalia of fuck paucity. A fuckless feast! A fuck-few festival!\n\nHe would not become\u2014as Trump has been\u2014a white-supremacist lightning rod, someone who\u2019s made every bigot and racist more comfortable with showing their true colors in public. He wouldn\u2019t cause Mexican ex-presidents to spit and drop f-bombs each time his name is mentioned, and he wouldn\u2019t almost start World War III each time he shook a foreign leader\u2019s hand. They\u2019d just wonder why America elected a loaf of butterless Wonder Bread president. And then they\u2019d forget about him.

When the toilet runs and won\u2019t stop, I have to fix it. This summer, when the spring above the garage broke, I had to call a dude and pay hella money to get it fixed. (Don\u2019t use that word.) In fact, in my five years of owning a house, I\u2019ve become an amateur plumber, handyman and exterminator. I guess this means we\u2019re living the American dream. One thing I did not anticipate, however, was how important Halloween would become to me.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Your granny didn\u2019t let me dress up for Oct. 31. The cool woman you enjoy hanging out with, the one who introduced you to eggs and candy about nine months before I planned, was a very different person when I was your age. I don\u2019t know if it was because she was raising me on her own and was therefore concerned about your dad growing up into a thug, but she was very strict when I was the age you are now.\n\nI was not allowed to dress up for Halloween, and I was forced to go to bootleg \u201cfall festivals\u201d that are a church\u2019s way of celebrating Halloween without being honest about it all. It\u2019s kinda like how the bag cereals at the bottom of the breakfast aisle that I once tried to trick you into believing tasted good are the bootleg versions of the name-brand cereals you like, or how you tried to convince me that John Legend was really good, but I had to inform you that he is more of a bootleg version of a good \u201990s R&B singer\u2014anyway, you get the point. It was wack.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I was surprised how much fun Halloween was for us. You got to dress up as your favorite character; we would walk all around the neighborhood, unafraid of the many police officers out on the street; and then we would come home and watch a scary movie (well, scary for you) while giving candy to the mostly white kids who knock on the door but would never otherwise come and visit the home of a black family.\n\n\n\nThis time with you is special to me. We live in a neighborhood full of police officers\u2014there is even that one down the street who flies the \u201cblue lives matter\u201d flag\u2014so you walking the streets at night scares the hell out of me more than any scary movie. We are black, and you\u2019re big for your age, so I\u2019m terrified of you playing out front after dark and ending up like Emmett Till or Tamir Rice or Trayvon Martin. But one thing bugged me about this holiday: You chose to dress up like white people. (By the way, don\u2019t say hell.)\n\n\n\nI get it. When I was your age, I read comics, too. I first loved the X-Men because they, like me, were exoticized outcasts. But then I branched out and began to read everything I could. DC, Marvel, Top Cow \u2026 it didn\u2019t matter. I enjoyed being lost in a world where people had powers. I imagined myself as the leaders. Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit \u2026 I embodied them. I tried to be like them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI now know that this was not good for me.\n\n\n\nImagining myself as a white person alienated me from my body, from my culture. It caused me anxiety and cognitive dissonance because, when I looked in the mirror, no matter what I did, I would never be like them. I would never be white. So when I saw you choosing Superman, Kylo Ren and Iron Man as your costumes, it concerned me. I did not want to just say no and take away your agency, but I saw that I had to be more intentional about centering blackness in your cultural consumption. I could not raise you as if you were just any kid, because you\u2019re not just like any other kid. You\u2019re black\u2014and that makes you different from what our country sees as normal; therefore, I had to raise you in an abnormal way.\n\n\n\nLike the superheroes you idolize, you are unusual, peculiar, special\u2014at least in this country. So I introduced you to Black Panther, then to Miles Morales and then to Luke Cage. The first two you thought were cool, but Luke Cage spoke to you in a special way. I still wonder why. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that he is super strong. Or that he is bulletproof, thereby immune to all that life may send his way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you like that he wears a hoodie in the TV show. Maybe it is because you wear hoodies. Hell, I wear them. It\u2019s part of a black man\u2019s armor. That cultural connection resonates with you, but I know that most of all, the fact that he is black matters most. He looks like you. He comes from where you come from. You don\u2019t have to look in the mirror and imagine that you are someone else. You see yourself when you see him.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know this yet, but your blackness is a gift. It is a special power. You can see the world through your eyes but also through the eyes of those who look at you condescendingly. It\u2019s called double consciousness. It\u2019ll be useful, but it comes with a price. The world will hate you. They will be suspicious of you. They might see you as older than you are and try to treat you as a threat. But that is why I\u2019m happy you choose to idolize a black superhero. It reminds you that even in a fictional narrative, blackness can be powerful.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to try to embody whiteness the way I did at your age. You can see yourself and still be a superhero. Maybe this is why Ta-Nehisi Coates decided to write Marvel\u2019s Black Panther comics and agreed to tweet about the show Luke Cage. He, too, is a father and a lover of comics\u2014he knows the power of representation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you for choosing Luke Cage to be your character this Halloween. Thank you for deciding to grow locs and embrace your blackness. Thank you for idolizing black athletes like Jackie Robinson and Ken Griffey Jr. Thank you for working so hard in school (you have no idea how brilliant and athletically talented you are; I hope you see it soon). But most important, thank you for choosing me to be your dad.\n\n\n\nI love you. I look forward to sharing this Halloween with you.\n\n\n\n(P.S.: Clean your room.)\n\n", "keywords": ["luke", "white", "way", "thank", "cage", "good", "thanks", "halloween", "son", "dont", "age", "wants", "know", "letter", "black"], "polarity": 0.13865376453611752, "subjectivity": 0.5133314659197011},

Jamison, Malcolm X, Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson and the body that formerly housed the soul of famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs adulthood goes, many of us have been forced to take a more nuanced and sobering look at some of our Black History Month heroes. Ben Carson, for example, has devolved from a shining example of black academic excellence to an unbelievably inept Donald Trump sycophant who loses his front teeth while eating grits and lies about being held at gunpoint at Popeyes.\n\nFootball legend and activist Jim Brown was a former Richard Nixon supporter and recent Trump advocate, and he has a seldom-discussed history of domestic violence. Civil rights leader, organizer and activist Bayard Rustin publicly repudiated the leaders of the Black Campus Movement\u2014a struggle waged by black college students to reform higher education\u2014and implored college officials to \u201cstop capitulating to the stupid demands of Negro students.\u201d You can peer into the life of many a lauded hero and find a few contradictions that are difficult to reconcile.\n\nSo in the spirit of realistic approaches to our more complex and notable Negroes, it\u2019s time to broach another sobering aspect of black history: Jackie Robinson was kind of an opp, and he made some political moves that today would illicit a lot of ire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch an assessment may seem blasphemous, as we are used to seeing depictions of Jackie Robinson as a brave and brilliantly gifted athlete tasked with the enormous burden of being the first black professional baseball player and ultimately a de facto representative of his race, the symbolic promise of integration and a significant figure in the civil rights movement. Those things are true.\n\nWhat\u2019s also true is that, well ... his position and visibility were often weaponized by influential white people to publicly demonize and chastise black radicals and assure the white public that such politics did not reflect the will and morals of the black community.\n\n\n\nIn April 1949, when the Cold War began to intensify, actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson traveled to France to attend the Soviet Union-sponsored Paris Peace Conference. After singing \u201cJoe Hill,\u201d Robeson addressed the audience and offered some impromptu words about the lives of black people in the United States, as he often did. Robeson\u2019s aim was to stress that World War III was not inevitable, as many Americans did not want war with the Soviet Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he took the stage, however, his speech had somehow already been transcribed and dispatched to the United States by the Associated Press. By the following day, editorialists and politicians had branded Robeson a Communist traitor for insinuating that black Americans would not fight in a war against the Soviet Union. Historians would later discover that Robeson had been misquoted, but the damage was almost instantly done, and because he was out of the country, the singer was unaware of the firestorm brewing back home over the speech.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end for Robeson, who would soon be declared \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s voice of America\u201d by a witness at hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee. At this hearing, committee Chair John Wood, a Georgia Democrat, summoned baseball great Jackie Robinson to Washington to testify before HUAC for the purpose of implicating Robeson as a Communist (which he was) and obliterating Robeson\u2019s leadership role in the American black community.\n\nIn his testimony, Robinson assured Americans that Robeson did not speak for all blacks with his \u201csilly\u201d personal views. Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt noted, \u201cMr. Robeson does his people great harm in trying to line them up on the Communist side of [the] political picture. Jackie Robinson helps them greatly by his forthright statements.\u201d This was especially hard for Robeson, as he was one of Robinson\u2019s most ardent and vocal advocates and once called for boycotts of Yankee Stadium as a response to baseball\u2019s lack of integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a later statement, Robinson asserted, \u201cThe fact that because it is a Communist who denounces injustice in the courts, police brutality and lynching, when it happens, doesn\u2019t change the truth of his charges.\u201d Racial discrimination, Robinson said, is not \u201ca creation of Communist imagination.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash against Robeson was immediate. His blacklisting and the revocation of his passport rendered him unable to work or travel, and he saw his yearly income drop from more than $150,000 to less than $3,000. Robeson\u2019s name was stricken from the college All-America football teams. Newsreel footage of him was destroyed, recordings were erased and there was a clear effort in the media to avoid any mention of his name.\n\nRobeson refused to be drawn into a personal feud with Robinson because \u201cto do that would be exactly what the other group wants us to do.\u201d In 1960, Robinson would come to endorse HUAC member Richard Nixon in his presidential bid only to withdraw his support in 1968, furious over Nixon\u2019s courtship of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who had once led the segregationist Dixiecrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson did, however, reprise his role as the Negro defuser, once again using his visibility and influence to be an ardent opponent to the threat of black radicalism in a heated public fued with Malcolm X, and for much of 1963 and part of 1964, Robinson was one of Malcolm X\u2019s most vocal critics, and Malcolm one of his.\n\nJackie struck the first blow, condemning Malcolm\u2019s separatist views in a column for the Chicago Public Defender and igniting a volatile public fallout that even involved threats of physical harm (on Malcolm\u2019s part). Robinson often passionately cited Malcolm and the Nation of Islam as viable threats to the civil rights movement, and Robinson later went on record to condemn riots and any other acts of violence and to publicly criticize Muhammad Ali\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, claiming, \u201cHe\u2019s not willing to show his appreciation to a country that\u2019s giving him, in my view, a fantastic opportunity.\u201d\n\nToward the end of his life, Jackie Robinson had a chance to reflect on some of his political choices. Regarding his testimony for the HUAC, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cI would reject such an invitation if offered now \u2026 I have grown wiser and closer to the painful truths about America\u2019s destructiveness. ... And I do have increased respect for Paul Robeson who, over the span of twenty years, sacrificed himself, his career and the wealth and comfort he once enjoyed because, I believe, he was sincerely trying to help his people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this was decades after Robeson\u2019s career was ruined; he struggled to make a living and suffered from an onslaught of debilitating depression and health problems. In another gracious showing, Robinson went on to write that Malcolm X\u2019s assassination was a \u201ctragedy of the first order.\u201d\n\n\n\nJackie Robinson made some of these choices because he earnestly believed he was acting in the best interest of preserving the \u201cprogress\u201d that he and other \u201cresponsible\u201d civil rights leaders had fought hard to achieve. But in a world where multiple truths can coexist, it can also be said that he was a man who was well-aware of the influence he wielded and often used it to assist in delegitimizing black radical voices that both he and white America saw as a threat to the status quo.

That was part of the component, and it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s discretion at that point whether they want to pass them or not.\n\n\u201cBut if a kid doesn\u2019t stand for the pledge, who said he doesn\u2019t care if these military people live or die, who doesn\u2019t respect his peers and is a discipline problem in the classroom\u2014why should I reward this kid?\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow, what a douchebag.\n\nThe controversial Facebook post, according to the report, referred to the students as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d\n\nBut what is posted online is your own damn problem, and members of the public quickly contacted the school district, which took action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe school district is aware of a teacher posting on social media about a situation involving grades and standing for the Pledge of Allegiance that occurred more than a decade ago,\u201d Superintendent William Lloyd said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe district has taken the proactive measure of assigning this faculty member to out-of-classroom duties until further investigation into the matter can be completed. The district will make available any information that is uncovered that can legally and responsibly be released to the public.\u201d\n\nStill, despite the ridiculousness of it all, Solomon is still a white man, and he was suspended with pay.\n\nAnd after all the backlash, Solomon has seemed to backtrack on his shitty actions just a bit, claiming that he didn\u2019t make the kids stand, even though his Facebook status stated that he \u201crequired\u201d the students he failed to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make them stand. They didn\u2019t stand. They sat,\u201d he said. \u201cI encouraged them to stand and I said your standing is just a respect for the country, the flag and for the military people that risked their lives to fight to protect your freedom.\u201d\n\nRead more at Newsday.", "keywords": ["district", "teacher", "bragging", "pledge", "facebook", "suspended", "high", "school", "newsday", "failed", "stand", "failing", "refused", "solomon", "post", "students"], "polarity": 0.0006705948372615037, "subjectivity": 0.44270061728395055},

Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump made his comments after the reasons he gave for firing FBI Director James Comey during an NBC interview Thursday were directly contradicted by statements made by others in the White House, including Vice President Mike Pence, meaning that the various explanations were at best misleading and, at worst, flat out lies.\n\nTrump sent out two tweets Friday suggesting that he would cancel White House press briefings and instead hand out written statements to communicate with the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent explanations have been given for Comey\u2019s firing, and the stories coming out of the Trump White House have changed each day since it happened. As the Post notes, this calls into question the credibility of not only press secretary Sean Spicer but also Pence, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway.\n\nSpicer told reporters Friday that the president was \u201cdismayed\u201d that the focus was on the accuracy of the statements delivered by his spokesmen.\n\n\u201cThe president is an active president.

Rosenstein, but by Wednesday the word was that Trump had been considering firing Comey for a long time, and made the final determination after hearing from Sessions and Rosenstein.\n\nAll along, his spokesmen have maintained that Trump\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the ongoing Russia investigation that Comey was overseeing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said that he made the decision to fire Comey on his own and that he would have done it regardless of what Rosenstein recommended, adding that he had been thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he came to his decision to fire Comey.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story; it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election th they should have won,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["white", "president", "threatens", "staff", "firing", "statements", "cant", "press", "briefings", "straight", "comey", "trump", "house", "russia", "end", "thing"], "polarity": 0.10148809523809524, "subjectivity": 0.4449404761904762},

A group of college students in Ohio are the latest in the nation to accuse a dining establish of racial discrimination, or some sort of profiling, after a manager demanded that they pay for their meal up front because, you know, \u201cyou people steal.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Vindicator, a local newspaper, Youngstown State University student Samora Savage was with friends and classmates when they decided to go to the Royal Grill Buffet in Boardman. The group were asked to pay before they were allowed to be seated. Savage and her friends agreed to pay, but then noticed something was not quite right after she realized that other customers weren\u2019t asked to do the same.\n\nSavage asked the manager about the discrepancy, only for the manager to respond, \u201cYou people steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the way we were treated there,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nAnother diner who noticed the disagreement reportedly got involved and began shouting at the manager about the discriminatory behavior. But the manager, Jay Dong, apparently has no shame in his stance, and insists that his policies are not racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDong told the site that he makes some people pay up front, acknowledging that more often than not those customers are black, but notes that he does not think it\u2019s discrimination because he does not make all of his black customers pay first. So naturally that makes it all better.\n\nHe said that it was a policy he usually uses for people he does not know, or when it\u2019s a big group of people who plan to pay for separate checks.\n\n\u201cA lot of people steal from me.

The air was sparkling. The sunlight was warm. The band struck up the national anthem. The flag billowed in the wind. It should have been a glorious moment for me as the stirring words of the national anthem poured from the stands. Perhaps, it was, but then again, perhaps, the anthem could be called the theme song for a drama called The Noble Experiment. Today, as I look back on that opening game of my first world series, I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickey\u2019s drama and that I was only a principal actor. As I write this twenty years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.\n\nKaepernick shared a similar sentiment after his game against Green Bay on Friday:\n\n\n\nI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\n\nKaepernick has since doubled down on his stance, even though many white Americans became completely unhinged at the thought of a man of color not showing gratitude or pledging allegiance to a country that continues to extrajudicially kill black, brown and indigenous people with impunity. Despite the nation's history of activist athletes\u2014including Muhammad Ali, who in 1966 refused to serve in the Vietnam War; Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their fists in a black power salute at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City as \u201cThe Star-Bangled Banner\u201d played\u2014their friend and ally Peter Norman standing beside them in solidarity; and Mahmoud Abdul Rauf, who in 1995 refused to participate in the \"nationalistic ritualism\" of recognizing the flag and singing the anthem\u2014racists in this country continue to feign surprise that blacks in America are not eternally grateful for the \"privilege\" of not being in chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1947 Jackie Robinson felt the beautiful burden of blackness as \u201cThe Star-Bangled Banner\u201d played. His dual consciousness, something that even during the last year of his life he could not quite explain, is evident in each word of his book. The gravitational pull of racism at odds with the euphoric pull of patriotic possibilities is what continues to keep many people of color off-balance, slipping and sliding on streets filled with the blood of our children and the tears of those who love them.\n\nWe know that \"we never had it made.\" And continuing to salute, stand at attention or place our hands over our hearts in honor of a symbol that has doubled as a noose around the necks of generations of black Americans, especially those who seek liberation, will ensure that we never do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson's words are ancestral wisdom. They are both road map and blueprint, waiting on us to find and build upon his understanding that \"liberty and justice for all\" is a red, white and blue lie.\n\nAnd what has once again been made clear in the last few days is that many white Americans just can't handle the truth.", "keywords": ["white", "sing", "americans", "anthem", "flag", "robinson", "1972", "jackie", "salute", "color", "stand", "know", "country", "black"], "polarity": 0.053093434343434324, "subjectivity": 0.38592171717171725},

Ilyasah Shabazz said that she and her sisters took on that mission after their mother\u2019s death in 1997.\n\nSo she is pleased with the Smithsonian Channel\u2019s one-hour documentary The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X, which tells the story of important years in the charismatic activist\u2019s life in his own words. There\u2019s no narrator or re-enactments\u2014just media reports, rarely and never-seen footage\u2014and the compelling voice of a man still seen by many as a controversial figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was such a young man with impeccable integrity, and you\u2019ll see there is no mistaking his commitment to achieving peace and an egalitarian future for all,\u201d Shabazz said at a recent screening of the film at the museum.\n\nThe film shows some of the crucial moments from Malcolm X\u2019s later years, ranging from his work as a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam and its leader, Elijah Muhammad, to mesmerizing speeches in which he exhorted black people to defend themselves and be proud of their heritage.\n\n\u201cWho taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin to such an extent that you bleach to get like the white man? \u2026 Who taught you to hate yourselves from the top of your head to the soles of your feet? Who taught you to hate your own kind? \u2026 No, before you come asking Mr. Muhammad does he teach hate, you should ask yourself who taught you to hate being what God gave you?\u201d Malcolm X once asked a cheering crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI, for one, as a Muslim, believe that the white man is intelligent enough\u2014if he were made to realize how black people really feel and how fed up we are, without that old compromising sweet talk,\u201d he continued. \u201cStop sweet-talking him. Tell him what kind of hell you\u2019ve been catching. And let him know that if he\u2019s not ready to clean his house up \u2026 he shouldn\u2019t have a house. It should catch on fire and burn down.\u201d\n\nThere is also footage of Malcolm X\u2019s disagreement with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on how best to empower people of color\u2014whether it should be separation from white society or nonviolent protests aimed at integration. His reaction to the firebombing of his home in 1965, with his pregnant wife and daughters inside, is included as well.\n\nBut his daughter worries about those who might see this film as doing a disservice to her father, after an audience member questioned whether it does a good job of explaining the terrible things that were going on at the time, including the bombing deaths of the four little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn this film, we see the fire extinguishers \u2026 the church bombings, the lynchings. Maybe there is too much of Malcolm\u2019s reaction, without showing what he was reacting to, that he had to give black people shock treatment,\u201d Shabazz mused. \u201cIf it\u2019s not put in context, how can anyone say that Malcolm was violent? How can anyone say that Malcolm was anything negative and not say anything about the social climate that created this reaction?\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising revelations in The Lost Tapes is that the increasing rift between Malcolm X and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad affected the former\u2019s friendship with boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who was given his own Muslim name by the NOI leader\u2014at a price.\n\n\u201cFor Muhammad Ali to be given his name\u2014for that to occur\u2014he had to break his friendship with Malcolm X,\u201d said Tom Jennings, producer of The Lost Tapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nation interfered with their friendship,\u201d added Shabazz, who said that Ali was told, \u201cYou will accept this name as long as you will no longer associate with Malcolm. \u2026 My father said I understand that\u2019s his loyalty. \u2026 And Muhammad Ali [later] said, \u2018I cannot believe that I did that and I regret that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe documentary follows Malcolm X through the later part of his life and his changing philosophy after taking the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and changing his name to el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He wrote about the revelation of sharing prayers and food with Muslims of all colors, even those with blond hair and blue eyes, and what it meant to his views about the strife occurring between African Americans and whites in the United States.\n\n\u201cI could see from this, that perhaps if white Americans could accept the oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in reality the oneness of Man,\u201d Malcolm X wrote, \u201cand cease to measure and hinder and harm others in terms of their \u2018differences\u2019 in color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNMAAHC Curator Damion Thomas said that he thinks Malcolm X\u2019s legacy is important for people of today, especially in a country that is arguably more racially divided than it has been since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWhat it says for us today is that it is important that African Americans build their own institutions, that African Americans think about how to control their own story, their own narrative and their own economic and political spaces,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s very important, self-determination and African-American empowerment.\u201d\n\nShabazz added: \u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge that this young, compassionate man sacrificed his entire life so that we could address those issues that continue to plague us because we keep brushing them under the rug.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X premieres Feb. 26 on the Smithsonian Channel.

Jamison, Malcolm X, Duke Ellington, Jackie Robinson and the body that formerly housed the soul of famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs adulthood goes, many of us have been forced to take a more nuanced and sobering look at some of our Black History Month heroes. Ben Carson, for example, has devolved from a shining example of black academic excellence to an unbelievably inept Donald Trump sycophant who loses his front teeth while eating grits and lies about being held at gunpoint at Popeyes.\n\nFootball legend and activist Jim Brown was a former Richard Nixon supporter and recent Trump advocate, and he has a seldom-discussed history of domestic violence. Civil rights leader, organizer and activist Bayard Rustin publicly repudiated the leaders of the Black Campus Movement\u2014a struggle waged by black college students to reform higher education\u2014and implored college officials to \u201cstop capitulating to the stupid demands of Negro students.\u201d You can peer into the life of many a lauded hero and find a few contradictions that are difficult to reconcile.\n\nSo in the spirit of realistic approaches to our more complex and notable Negroes, it\u2019s time to broach another sobering aspect of black history: Jackie Robinson was kind of an opp, and he made some political moves that today would illicit a lot of ire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch an assessment may seem blasphemous, as we are used to seeing depictions of Jackie Robinson as a brave and brilliantly gifted athlete tasked with the enormous burden of being the first black professional baseball player and ultimately a de facto representative of his race, the symbolic promise of integration and a significant figure in the civil rights movement. Those things are true.\n\nWhat\u2019s also true is that, well ... his position and visibility were often weaponized by influential white people to publicly demonize and chastise black radicals and assure the white public that such politics did not reflect the will and morals of the black community.\n\n\n\nIn April 1949, when the Cold War began to intensify, actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson traveled to France to attend the Soviet Union-sponsored Paris Peace Conference. After singing \u201cJoe Hill,\u201d Robeson addressed the audience and offered some impromptu words about the lives of black people in the United States, as he often did. Robeson\u2019s aim was to stress that World War III was not inevitable, as many Americans did not want war with the Soviet Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he took the stage, however, his speech had somehow already been transcribed and dispatched to the United States by the Associated Press. By the following day, editorialists and politicians had branded Robeson a Communist traitor for insinuating that black Americans would not fight in a war against the Soviet Union. Historians would later discover that Robeson had been misquoted, but the damage was almost instantly done, and because he was out of the country, the singer was unaware of the firestorm brewing back home over the speech.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end for Robeson, who would soon be declared \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s voice of America\u201d by a witness at hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee. At this hearing, committee Chair John Wood, a Georgia Democrat, summoned baseball great Jackie Robinson to Washington to testify before HUAC for the purpose of implicating Robeson as a Communist (which he was) and obliterating Robeson\u2019s leadership role in the American black community.\n\nIn his testimony, Robinson assured Americans that Robeson did not speak for all blacks with his \u201csilly\u201d personal views. Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt noted, \u201cMr. Robeson does his people great harm in trying to line them up on the Communist side of [the] political picture. Jackie Robinson helps them greatly by his forthright statements.\u201d This was especially hard for Robeson, as he was one of Robinson\u2019s most ardent and vocal advocates and once called for boycotts of Yankee Stadium as a response to baseball\u2019s lack of integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a later statement, Robinson asserted, \u201cThe fact that because it is a Communist who denounces injustice in the courts, police brutality and lynching, when it happens, doesn\u2019t change the truth of his charges.\u201d Racial discrimination, Robinson said, is not \u201ca creation of Communist imagination.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash against Robeson was immediate. His blacklisting and the revocation of his passport rendered him unable to work or travel, and he saw his yearly income drop from more than $150,000 to less than $3,000. Robeson\u2019s name was stricken from the college All-America football teams. Newsreel footage of him was destroyed, recordings were erased and there was a clear effort in the media to avoid any mention of his name.\n\nRobeson refused to be drawn into a personal feud with Robinson because \u201cto do that would be exactly what the other group wants us to do.\u201d In 1960, Robinson would come to endorse HUAC member Richard Nixon in his presidential bid only to withdraw his support in 1968, furious over Nixon\u2019s courtship of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who had once led the segregationist Dixiecrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson did, however, reprise his role as the Negro defuser, once again using his visibility and influence to be an ardent opponent to the threat of black radicalism in a heated public fued with Malcolm X, and for much of 1963 and part of 1964, Robinson was one of Malcolm X\u2019s most vocal critics, and Malcolm one of his.\n\nJackie struck the first blow, condemning Malcolm\u2019s separatist views in a column for the Chicago Public Defender and igniting a volatile public fallout that even involved threats of physical harm (on Malcolm\u2019s part). Robinson often passionately cited Malcolm and the Nation of Islam as viable threats to the civil rights movement, and Robinson later went on record to condemn riots and any other acts of violence and to publicly criticize Muhammad Ali\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, claiming, \u201cHe\u2019s not willing to show his appreciation to a country that\u2019s giving him, in my view, a fantastic opportunity.\u201d\n\nToward the end of his life, Jackie Robinson had a chance to reflect on some of his political choices. Regarding his testimony for the HUAC, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cI would reject such an invitation if offered now \u2026 I have grown wiser and closer to the painful truths about America\u2019s destructiveness. ... And I do have increased respect for Paul Robeson who, over the span of twenty years, sacrificed himself, his career and the wealth and comfort he once enjoyed because, I believe, he was sincerely trying to help his people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this was decades after Robeson\u2019s career was ruined; he struggled to make a living and suffered from an onslaught of debilitating depression and health problems. In another gracious showing, Robinson went on to write that Malcolm X\u2019s assassination was a \u201ctragedy of the first order.\u201d\n\n\n\nJackie Robinson made some of these choices because he earnestly believed he was acting in the best interest of preserving the \u201cprogress\u201d that he and other \u201cresponsible\u201d civil rights leaders had fought hard to achieve. But in a world where multiple truths can coexist, it can also be said that he was a man who was well-aware of the influence he wielded and often used it to assist in delegitimizing black radical voices that both he and white America saw as a threat to the status quo.

Ever.\n\n\n\nAll my life, there were no stockings hung by the chimney with care. (And I grew up in a house with a real, live working chimney!) No carefully wrapped gifts. No smell of pine needles and gingerbread houses. No carefully decorated Christmas tree with garland, candy canes and ornaments handed down through generations. None of it.\n\n\n\nMy parents joined the Nation of Islam in the early \u201970s, and while they became disillusioned relatively early on and eventually left, two of the major traditions remained in our household.\n\n\n\nThe first nonnegotiable: No pork (I finally caved as an adult, and now bacon is everything).\n\n\n\nThe second nonnegotiable: No Christmas.\n\n\n\nI will not front. I\u2019ve always wanted to celebrate Christmas. When I was a little girl, I told my parents that I understood and it didn\u2019t bother me that my friends were rolling in swag through the new year. But in reality, it just didn\u2019t seem fair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was a good kid. For real. Not just when the Christmas countdown started. But the neighborhood kids could act a hot mess all year, then write a list (!!!) of what they wanted and it would come\u2014all of it! If I could have flown to Chicago to have a little chat with Louis Farrakhan, I would have. Why couldn\u2019t young Muslims have some kind of ... mini-Elijah Muhammad or something to deliver gifts on a prayer rug?\n\nAs I got older, sometimes I would write out lists of things I would get for people if I celebrated Christmas. And a list of things I wanted as well (I know how pathetic this sounds). Over the years, I did occasionally have to buy some presents. It might be grab bag stuff for work or my kids\u2019 teachers and maybe something for my great-aunt Mildred who never understood why I didn\u2019t have any Christmas spirit. But that wasn\u2019t truly celebrating.\n\n\n\nWhen I had a household of my own, we began attending parties on Christmas Day with our Christian sides of the extended family tree. Over time, we began giving our daughters a gift or two to open at the party. Still no tree. No hot chocolate, no footie pajamas or stringing popcorn. No chestnuts roasting on an open fire. I know it\u2019s pretty lame that I only wanted to celebrate the warm and fuzzy gift-giving part of Christmas, but the feeling remained.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then 2017 came.\n\n\n\nWithout going into much detail (my marriage is transitioning to a nonmarriage! I just moved into my own place! I am a grown-ass divorcee!), I\u2019m in a different space in my life. And I decided this year\u2014it would be ALL about St. Nick up in this piece.\n\nI will not make any apologies. I am 40-plus. Everybody and their mama already got a chance to have Jack Frost nipping at their nose. It\u2019s my time to catch up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, first I made THE best Christmas-themed playlist ever. From Donny Hathaway to the Jackson Five\u2014and of course Mariah Carey and the best Christmas song of all time (that\u2019s Jesus, What a Wonderful Child, not All I Want for Christmas Is You\u2014trust me).\n\n\n\nThen it was time to map out a tree strategy. This was all new to me. I swear I was only mildly aware that trees come in real, prelit-fake and plain-fake varieties. And trees are ... trees. They need care. They need daily watering! Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me how expensive this process would be? I decided to bring Christmas to New Bae\u2019s house, since I have a wild and crazy puppy at my place.\n\nHe just shook his head when he noticed that I had no idea what I was doing and how involved it was. He got me a (real!) tree, set it up in his living room and then walked away, leaving me to figure it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYo, you have to get a tree, a base, a skirt, bulbs, lights, ornaments, candy canes, garland and tinsel. I couldn\u2019t even find a star for less than $20! And the Christmas Eve in my dreams includes footie pajamas, gingerbread-house kits, personalized Santa hats and more. This Jesus person requires a lot for his birthday party.\n\nNow, picking out gifts for friends, my New Bae (and, ahem, ex-bae) and the kids in my life has been the best part. Thinking about a loved one, giving some thought to that person\u2019s personality, having that aha moment, buying the perfect present and then hiding it until gift-wrapping time? That was the best thing ever, y\u2019all! Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me that buying gifts for people was so fulfilling?\n\n\n\nExample: Many years ago, one of my besties inherited a special cup-and-saucer set from her grandmother. They were all broken during a move, and for years she has had only one cup and saucer left. She looked for them over time but never found them. Well, guess who found a tiny distributor who makes that set?! It\u2019s now wrapped in personalized gift wrap, and I watched YouTube to learn how to make a traditional red-ribbon bow.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t judge me.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure why buying gifts for Christmas is more satisfying than buying birthday, wedding or graduation gifts. Maybe because during Christmas, more folks are shopping at the same time, so it feels more festive? Or maybe because gifts for other occasions feel more obligational than joyful? I\u2019m big on gift cards and cash for graduation and weddings, but I wouldn\u2019t dare buy a gift card for anyone on my first Christmas!\n\n\n\nNow, I will say this: I would NOT have enjoyed this process if I couldn\u2019t do this all online. I can\u2019t even fathom making a list, checking it twice and then going to the mall to shop. I did it all from my phone. Amazon Prime two-day delivery for the win.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI originally set a cap of $20 for each gift. That went out the window almost immediately. But I found another way to keep my spending in check: For every gift I purchased, I used that same amount to donate to a worthy organization. Blew my budget, but made me feel slightly better about it.\n\n\n\nNew Bae celebrated Christmas his entire life. Coming from a religious, churchgoing family, he told me that as a kid, when he woke up on Christmas morning, he would say, \u201cHappy birthday, Jesus!\u201d\n\n\n\nLike many black men during the \u201cFight the Power\u201d era, he moved away from organized religion and didn\u2019t celebrate for years. Eventually he was straight up embarrassed that he wished Jesus a happy birthday each year. I reassured him that he can be woke and still have a nonreligious Christmas tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(I\u2019m actually not sure if that\u2019s true. Is this offensive to Christian faithfuls? I really don\u2019t know.)\n\nI pulled him back into his childhood memories and eventually he came around. When he saw the tree we decorated, the slight smile told me I had him.\n\n\n\nA few days later he said to me, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pull me back into this, there\u2019s something we need to do. We are all going to Rockefeller Center to see the tree. We taking pictures and alladat.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to that I said, \u201cHappy birthday, Jesus!\u201d", "keywords": ["didnt", "life", "tree", "gifts", "gift", "lived", "tell", "1st", "birthday", "wanted", "christmas", "set", "celebrated", "entire", "tale", "real"], "polarity": 0.19011735686269107, "subjectivity": 0.504575517075517},

Residents of Philadelphia will take to the streets Monday afternoon to protest the imprisonment of the rapper and notorious collector of L\u2019s after the hip-hop star was imprisoned on parole violations.\n\nBorn Robert Williams, the emcee was sentenced to two to four years for violating the conditions of his parole in a 2008 weapons case. Mill was arrested in March for an altercation at a St. Louis airport, but charges were later dropped. In August of this year, Meek was charged with reckless endangerment after a traffic violation on a motorcycle.\n\nSupporters argue that Mill\u2019s sentence is too harsh, while lawyers for the star say that the judge has an unusual \u201cobsession\u201d with the case. Attorney Joe Tacopina told Billboard magazine that Judge Genece Brinkley is \u201cenamored\u201d with Meek after he recorded a song that mentioned her by name. Tacopina also states that Brinkley has shown up at Mill\u2019s court-ordered community service and even requested that Mill drop Roc Nation as his management and sign with a local manager with whom she has a relationship.\n\nCelebrities and activists have spoken out against the unusually harsh sentence. Billboard reports that Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jennings, known for his social activism against injustice and mass incarceration, plans to attend the rally, as well as 76ers legend Julius \u201cDr. J\u201d Erving. Philly native, and top five emcee of all time (fight me) and The Root 100 honoree who missed the party Black Thought also lent his support for the march.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeek Mill is imprisoned at Camp Hill State Correctional Institution.

A group of college students in Ohio are the latest in the nation to accuse a dining establish of racial discrimination, or some sort of profiling, after a manager demanded that they pay for their meal up front because, you know, \u201cyou people steal.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Vindicator, a local newspaper, Youngstown State University student Samora Savage was with friends and classmates when they decided to go to the Royal Grill Buffet in Boardman. The group were asked to pay before they were allowed to be seated. Savage and her friends agreed to pay, but then noticed something was not quite right after she realized that other customers weren\u2019t asked to do the same.\n\nSavage asked the manager about the discrepancy, only for the manager to respond, \u201cYou people steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the way we were treated there,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nAnother diner who noticed the disagreement reportedly got involved and began shouting at the manager about the discriminatory behavior.

Ilyasah Shabazz said that she and her sisters took on that mission after their mother\u2019s death in 1997.\n\nSo she is pleased with the Smithsonian Channel\u2019s one-hour documentary The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X, which tells the story of important years in the charismatic activist\u2019s life in his own words. There\u2019s no narrator or re-enactments\u2014just media reports, rarely and never-seen footage\u2014and the compelling voice of a man still seen by many as a controversial figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was such a young man with impeccable integrity, and you\u2019ll see there is no mistaking his commitment to achieving peace and an egalitarian future for all,\u201d Shabazz said at a recent screening of the film at the museum.\n\nThe film shows some of the crucial moments from Malcolm X\u2019s later years, ranging from his work as a minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam and its leader, Elijah Muhammad, to mesmerizing speeches in which he exhorted black people to defend themselves and be proud of their heritage.\n\n\u201cWho taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin to such an extent that you bleach to get like the white man? \u2026 Who taught you to hate yourselves from the top of your head to the soles of your feet? Who taught you to hate your own kind? \u2026 No, before you come asking Mr. Muhammad does he teach hate, you should ask yourself who taught you to hate being what God gave you?\u201d Malcolm X once asked a cheering crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI, for one, as a Muslim, believe that the white man is intelligent enough\u2014if he were made to realize how black people really feel and how fed up we are, without that old compromising sweet talk,\u201d he continued. \u201cStop sweet-talking him. Tell him what kind of hell you\u2019ve been catching. And let him know that if he\u2019s not ready to clean his house up \u2026 he shouldn\u2019t have a house. It should catch on fire and burn down.\u201d\n\nThere is also footage of Malcolm X\u2019s disagreement with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on how best to empower people of color\u2014whether it should be separation from white society or nonviolent protests aimed at integration. His reaction to the firebombing of his home in 1965, with his pregnant wife and daughters inside, is included as well.\n\nBut his daughter worries about those who might see this film as doing a disservice to her father, after an audience member questioned whether it does a good job of explaining the terrible things that were going on at the time, including the bombing deaths of the four little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn this film, we see the fire extinguishers \u2026 the church bombings, the lynchings. Maybe there is too much of Malcolm\u2019s reaction, without showing what he was reacting to, that he had to give black people shock treatment,\u201d Shabazz mused. \u201cIf it\u2019s not put in context, how can anyone say that Malcolm was violent? How can anyone say that Malcolm was anything negative and not say anything about the social climate that created this reaction?\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising revelations in The Lost Tapes is that the increasing rift between Malcolm X and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad affected the former\u2019s friendship with boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who was given his own Muslim name by the NOI leader\u2014at a price.\n\n\u201cFor Muhammad Ali to be given his name\u2014for that to occur\u2014he had to break his friendship with Malcolm X,\u201d said Tom Jennings, producer of The Lost Tapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nation interfered with their friendship,\u201d added Shabazz, who said that Ali was told, \u201cYou will accept this name as long as you will no longer associate with Malcolm. \u2026 My father said I understand that\u2019s his loyalty. \u2026 And Muhammad Ali [later] said, \u2018I cannot believe that I did that and I regret that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe documentary follows Malcolm X through the later part of his life and his changing philosophy after taking the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and changing his name to el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He wrote about the revelation of sharing prayers and food with Muslims of all colors, even those with blond hair and blue eyes, and what it meant to his views about the strife occurring between African Americans and whites in the United States.\n\n\u201cI could see from this, that perhaps if white Americans could accept the oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in reality the oneness of Man,\u201d Malcolm X wrote, \u201cand cease to measure and hinder and harm others in terms of their \u2018differences\u2019 in color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNMAAHC Curator Damion Thomas said that he thinks Malcolm X\u2019s legacy is important for people of today, especially in a country that is arguably more racially divided than it has been since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWhat it says for us today is that it is important that African Americans build their own institutions, that African Americans think about how to control their own story, their own narrative and their own economic and political spaces,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s very important, self-determination and African-American empowerment.\u201d\n\nShabazz added: \u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge that this young, compassionate man sacrificed his entire life so that we could address those issues that continue to plague us because we keep brushing them under the rug.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Lost Tapes: Malcolm X premieres Feb. 26 on the Smithsonian Channel.

In front of a throng gathered for the anniversary of the Million Man March, he accused the federal government of systematically poisoning black and Latinx children.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been brought to our attention,\u201d he thundered, \u201cthat the senior lead scientist for the Center for Disease Control has admitted that the MMR vaccines and many of the vaccine shots have been genetically modified to attack black and Latino boys.\u201d\n\nHe paused for effect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard me,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cWe are living in a wicked time, where we\u2019re dealing with a spiritual wickedness in high places!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuhammad likened vaccinations to Pharaoh killing the sons of the children of Israel. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to force vaccines on baby boys\u2014at least 80 shots before they\u2019re three years old.\u201d He urged his audience of thousands to march on the CDC in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re going to say, \u2018Not another Tuskegee on our watch!\u2019\u201d he roared. \u201cWe\u2019ll be damned if we\u2019re going to sit around and let someone else pump us up full of viruses!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the CDC is systematically poisoning black and Latino boys. It\u2019s no mystery where Muhammad got that sentiment. He heard it, he told the crowd, from the scion of one of the most influential political families in American history: the famous environmental activist and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Kennedy enlisted the help of the Nation of Islam, a black separatist organization, in his years-long campaign to convince Americans that vaccines cause autism. According to several reports, Kennedy wanted to encourage black families to consider not vaccinating their children, based on a debunked claim that a mercury-based preservative in vaccines causes autism. At the time, Kennedy was trying to stop SB 277, a California bill which eliminated a personal-belief exemption that some parents had used to avoid vaccinating their kids. In April, in promoting an anti-vaccine movie called Trace Amounts, Kennedy referred to vaccine injuries as \u201ca holocaust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy and the Nation of Islam didn\u2019t succeed in opposing SB 277, but the relationship between the Nation of Islam and anti-vaccine groups has only grown. It\u2019s one of the strangest political alliances in America\u2014and one that, if it\u2019s effective, could have serious public health consequences.\n\n\n\nThis is an exciting time for the American anti-vaccine movement: Before taking office, the president repeatedly tweeted that vaccines cause autism. (There\u2019s an enormous body of evidence proving that\u2019s not true, including a 2014 meta-analysis that looked at studies involving over one million children.) The lead proponent of that claim is Andrew Wakefield, the former gastroenterologist who was the lead author on a 1998 study linking the MMR vaccine and autism. During the election, Wakefield reportedly claimed to have met privately with Trump and then endorsed him, although he\u2019s British and was unable to vote in the U.S. While we don\u2019t have confirmation that meeting took place, Wakefield did attend an inaugural ball held in Trump\u2019s honor, in January.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakefield says that a whistleblower at the CDC named Dr. William Thompson claimed that the organization is covering up the fact that the MMR vaccine is linked to a \u201c340 percent increase in autism\u201d among black boys. (Thompson hasn\u2019t spoken publicly in years and his attorney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on this story.)\n\nUndaunted by Thompson\u2019s recent silence, Wakefield has been promulgating his story about a so-called CDC coverup ever since. His numbers are as catastrophic as they are questionable: he\u2019s claimed that by 2032, one out of two children in America will have autism. On a conspiracy-themed cruise I covered for Jezebel in 2016, he claimed that a full 80 percent of boys will have autism within 15 years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakefield\u2019s study suggesting an MMR-autism link was retracted in 2010 and he was subsequently stripped of his medical license. Despite that, he still holds enormous sway and influence, gathering a dedicated following of parents who believe he\u2019s the only person telling the truth about their children\u2019s vaccine injuries. In 2016, Wakefield and a former CBS producer named Del Bigtree released Vaxxed, a film claiming, again, that the Centers for Disease Control and other major medical bodies are colluding to cover up the fact that the MMR vaccine causes autism, particularly in African-American boys. Vaxxed was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival after a huge outcry, but has screened independently in theaters across the country and in Europe for over a year. It\u2019s built a large and vocal grassroots following: two different Facebook groups supporting the movie each have over 75,000 members.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong the way, Wakefield and Bigtree have made a lot of new friends, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who, in addition to his work as the president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a well-respected environmental organization dedicated to protecting the nation\u2019s waterways, is one of the major proponents besides Wakefield of the belief that vaccines cause autism. In 2005, he wrote a now-infamous story, \u201cDeadly Immunity,\u201d published simultaneously on Salon and in Rolling Stone. The story charged that thimerosal, a preservative used in some vaccines, was linked to autism, and that government agencies had colluded to cover it up. (The story was retracted and subsequently deleted by Salon.) Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a mercury compound that the World Health Organization says is safe and non-toxic in the amounts found in some vaccines.\n\n(Kennedy declined to be interviewed for this piece after we failed to reach an agreement about the form it would take. Kennedy requested that Jezebel post only a transcript of any interview, unedited, which Jezebel refused to do.)\n\nThimerosal was removed from virtually all childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001 out of an abundance of caution (although it\u2019s still used in some multi-dose vials of flu vaccines) and was never put in the MMR vaccine. But that hasn\u2019t stopped vaccine skeptics from believing vaccines still contain it and other ingredients they believe to be harmful. In January, Kennedy made waves by announcing that Trump had asked him to chair a vaccine safety commission. Since then, though, there\u2019s been no progress on that commission, and Kennedy has tweeted frequent, bitter criticisms of Trump\u2019s environmental policies, which seems to suggest the two aren\u2019t on good terms.\n\nThe new friendship between Kennedy and the leadership of the Nation of Islam is not, on its face, an obvious one. The NOI has called for the establishment of a separate country for the descendants of slaves and for prohibitions on both intermarriage and \u201crace mixing.\u201d (The Southern Poverty Law Center designates it as a hate group based on a history of anti-gay and anti-Semitic rhetoric, particularly under its current leader, Louis Farrakhan.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in fact, the Nation of Islam has been anti-vaccine for decades, a skepticism that\u2019s part of a broader distrust of the medical establishment. In the 1960s, according to Farrakhan, the NOI\u2019s most influential leader Elijah Muhammad told his followers not to get the polio vaccine, but said others were acceptable. In 2004, a story in their official newspaper, the Final Call, suggested that vaccines could be linked to health problems from autism to diabetes. By 2013, Farrakhan was claiming children in Zimbabwe were being intentionally poisoned with vaccines from Europe and the U.S., \u201cto limit the population of Black people in those countries and places in the world where America\u2019s needs for their vital minerals and resources were deemed necessary.\u201d (The idea that medicines are part of an effort to poison black people has a lot of traction in the NOI: In his 1965 book A Message to the Blackman in America, Elijah Muhammad said birth control was also a depopulation scheme and a \u201cdeath plan.\u201d)\n\nAnd it\u2019s the absolute truth that if anyone has reason to distrust the medical establishment, it\u2019s black and Latinx Americans, as well as Native people. The Tuskegee experiment, a government-backed, horrific, racist experiment in which black men with syphilis were left untreated for 40 years so scientists could observe the progression of the disease, was just one hideous chapter in a sordid history of medical abuses in this country. The 20th century alone saw federally-funded forced sterilization programs that targeted mostly poor women of color by the thousands. The \u201840s through the \u201870s saw a series of ghoulish human radiation experiments where mentally disabled children and prisoners, among others, were unknowingly dosed with radiation to test its effects. Black people have also been subjected to risky surgeries, assumed by doctors to feel less pain than whites, and, even today, people of color receive a lower quality of medical care going by almost any metric you care to use.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that the NOI was receptive when Kennedy came calling. According to a blogger named Kent Heckenlively, who edits the anti-vaccine site Age of Autism, Kennedy met with the Nation of Islam\u2019s Tony Muhammad, the Western Regional Representative for the NOI, for the first time in the summer of 2015. \u201cMinister Tony got a call from one of his members,\u201d Heckenlively wrote, \u201csaying that Robert Kennedy, Jr. wanted to meet a member of the black community who had the courage to take on the vaccine/autism issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMinister Muhammad told Jezebel that he met Kennedy through a white anti-vaccine activist named Lucy Cole, who was working with the Vaccine Injury Awareness League, a group that frequently collaborates with Kennedy. \u201cShe was just seeking a way to find some black leader who they could sit down with,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cTo connect with what\u2019s happening with vaccines and black boys.\u201d\n\nMuhammad says it was the first time he\u2019d specifically heard the vaccine-autism connection, but he didn\u2019t vaccinate his own children out of general safety concerns. (\u201cWe always felt we were a target.\u201d) Following a meeting with Kennedy and other vaccine skeptics, he drew a comparison between vaccines and the Tuskeegee experiment. Soon after teaming up with Kennedy, Muhammad decided it was time to take the issue to the Nation of Islam leadership: he and a group of the white anti-vaccine activists flew to Chicago to meet with Louis Farrakhan. \u201cAt that time we decided to get involved with warning and educating our community,\u201d Muhammad told Jezebel. \u201cThis has flown over the black community\u2019s head.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NOI formed an organization called Vaccine Justice or Else!, and held a protest in front of the CDC. (Dave Gorski of the blog Science-Based Medicine covered that meeting at the time, and was among the first people to write in detail about the new relationship between anti-vaxxers and the Nation of Islam. So did a science blog called Respectful Insolence that often covers the anti-vaccine movement, and which called the new relationship \u201cdespicable.\u201d)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2015, Muhammad told an anti-vaccine blogger that vaccines were his new focus, and that it was his mission to warn black people in \u201cevery urban city\u201d about the dangers:\n\n\u201cThis movement has taken on a new life in the black community, and it is my job, on behalf of the Hon. Minister Louis Farrakhan and the Nation, to make sure I go to every urban city to warn our people that there could possibly be another Tuskegee going on right under our nose which actually according to the numbers that I have been getting on black boys who have been ill-effected, actually make the Tuskegee Experiment look like a Sunday school picnic.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate over SB 277 in California, Muhammad and the NOI came out strongly against the bill, telling members of the California Legislative Black Caucus they\u2019d be considered traitors if they voted for it and likening it, again, to Tuskeegee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the failure to stop SB 277, Muhammad didn\u2019t shift his focus from vaccines: throughout 2016, he embarked on a cross-country tour to screen Vaxxed in black community spaces, and the NOI held a \u201csummit on vaccine safety\u201d in October 2016. They also held followed by a screening of Vaxxed for NOI members.\n\nThe friendship with Kennedy and the Vaxxed filmmakers gives the NOI a new and powerful propaganda tool: the film itself, which is presented as an authoritative, scientific, impartial look at vaccines. The NOI\u2019s theories on vaccines, in turn, got a big boost from the film, a pseudo-scientific veneer of respectability, and a new, specific conspiracy \u2014the idea that the CDC is concealing the dangers of the MMR vaccine\u2014to graft onto existing and deep-seated distrust of vaccines and the medical establishment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVaxxed, Muhammad says, \u201chelped me to do my own research,\u201d and it helped convince him that pharmaceutical companies are not to be trusted.\n\nThe anti-vaccine movement has traditionally been led by higher-income white people who are more likely to trust their own (usually internet-based) research than professional medical advice. For now, doctors who work with predominantly black pediatric patients aren\u2019t seeing a huge rise in vaccine refusals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing any more refusals from Black families than I used to,\u201d writes Dr. Byron White, a Virginia-based physician who has worked in pediatrics. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in different practices, so my numbers vary by geography, but I would get full refusals from parents less than eight percent of the time. In Black families, less than three percent.\u201d\n\nThe main obstacle keeping the Nation of Islam from effectively spreading an anti-vaccine message is a basic one: in 2007, the group\u2019s core membership was estimated at around 50,000 people and there\u2019s no indication it\u2019s grown much since then. The group\u2019s rhetoric can also be alienating. According to the L.A. Times, a broad coalition of black social justice and political groups were disgusted by the Tuskeegee comparison during the SB 277 debate:\n\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, recent attacks on the measure have been vicious, unfounded and distort the science and history of childhood immunization within our community,\u201d said a statement by the California State Conference of the NAACP, the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, the Charles R. Drew Medical Society, the California Black Health Network and the Network of Ethnic Physician Organizations.\n\n\u201cOur organizations denounce assertions that vaccination of black children would be another Tuskegee experiment,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so clear how many African-Americans are following through on the advice of the NOI because they\u2019re somewhat peripheral,\u201d says Dr. Pierrette Mimi Poinsett, a physician and author and speaker who lives in the Bay Area. But she\u2019s watched the NOI and anti-vaccine forces try to grow their support using means they think will sway black people: \u201cOne of the things they did to broaden their base was to engage rappers in this effort, Like Snoop Dogg, he was the main one.\u201d (Snoop Dogg made a video in April 2016 declaring \u201cFuck that, I\u2019m not taking no flu shot.\u201d The NOI has also said that the rapper T.I. showed up at their 2016 vaccine summit.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPierette also pointed to an incident earlier this year where children in a Somali immigrant community in Minnesota suffered a large measles outbreak. Parents there got the idea that vaccines cause autism from Wakefield himself. There was a sharp drop in immunization rates, according to the Star-Tribune: \u201cFor Somali 2-year-olds, they were as high as 92 percent in 2004, but today stand at just 42 percent.\u201d\n\nThat means that anti-vaccine rhetoric can have a direct measurable impact on community health, even if the overall numbers are small. \u201cThe concern is that it could happen elsewhere, absolutely,\u201d Dr. Pierette says.\n\nIf families who live in urban areas are convinced by Kennedy and Muhammed\u2019s message and decide to significantly delay vaccinating their kids or avoid vaccinating altogether, the public-health risk is clear. They would make themselves and a large community around them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. Not to mention what it does to the infants themselves: even delaying vaccines can put them at increased risk of fever-related seizures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the people pushing this message are getting around. In recent months, Andrew Wakefield himself has largely receded into the background; he appears to be busy holding Vaxxed screenings in Europe, particularly his native England. But Bigtree, with whom he made Vaxxed, has made several joint appearances with Muhammad and Kennedy. At one recent appearance at the D.C. Press Club, they were joined by actor Robert DeNiro, who has a son with autism and has very publicly promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.\n\n\n\nAt the event, Muhammad declared that \u201cthe Tuskeegee experiment could be back, alive, and well. It took a Kennedy to shut down that experiment. Now we have to ask ourselves as a community, could it be that it\u2019s happening to us again?\u201d Muhammad added that he\u2019s visited 30 cities to show Vaxxed to audiences \u201cthat are full of poor people.\u201d\n\nLater this month, Kennedy, Bigtree and Muhammad are set to appear together at a Baptist church in Atlanta for an event titled \u201cState of Emergency.\u201d The flyer for the event asks \u201cTuskeegee Experiment, Again?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there are signs that these ideas about vaccines are edging further into the mainstream. On June 14 of this year, the influential New York radio station Power 105.1 aired an interview on the Breakfast Club, their most popular show, with Freddie Gibbs, a hip-hop artist who recently joined the Nation of Islam. Joining him was Tony Muhammad. One of the Breakfast Club\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked Muhammad, \u201cWhat\u2019s some of the work you\u2019re doing with vaccines?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you know i\u2019m the one that Bobby Kennedy came to,\u201d Muhammad began. \u201cBobby Kennedy was given some startling information. There is a scientist who works right now for the CDC. Forty years ago we had the Tuskegee experiment, and that experiment was done by the United States Health Service. It was so atrocious they changed their name to the CDC. It was Ted Kennedy that shut that down. And 40 years later we found out that the Tuskegee experiment has not stopped.\u201d\n\nFor the next twelve minutes, without any real objection or pushback from the hosts, Muhammad was allowed to deliver an error-filled virtual monologue on the dangers of vaccines, which he linked to an uptick in both autism and ADHD.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never vaccinated any of my children and they\u2019ve never been sick,\u201d he told Gibbs and the hosts at one point. \u201cIt\u2019s the vaccinated children that get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t new, and it\u2019s spiritual,\u201d Muhammad said on air, going on to claim to that black boys are more susceptible to being harmed by aluminum than black girls and encouraging parents to wait to vaccinate their kids. Muhammad also claimed, like Wakefield, that by 2032 \u201cone in two children will have autism. Eighty percent of the boys. They\u2019re absolutely creating zombies and Frankensteins, and we\u2019re the targets.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuhammad told Jezebel he\u2019s hoping to get other celebrities involved in the anti-vaccine effort. \u201cI\u2019m not going to mention their names, but since that interview we\u2019re about to have some big meetings. We\u2019re gonna do our own documentary. We\u2019re going to do our own studies. We\u2019re not going to rely on white scientists who are persuaded by political pressures for the sake of injecting my child.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, he doesn\u2019t hold a grudge against NOI members who decide to vaccinate. \u201cI never tell people what to do. If people want to vaccinate, go ahead, play Russian roulette. That\u2019s your right.\u201d\n\nThe NOI held a meeting on June 22 for black clergy members in Atlanta to try to create a broader black anti-vaccine coalition. And on August 27, they\u2019re promising to march on the CDC yet again. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna march on the CDC and we\u2019re gonna shut it down,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in so deep, God willing. We\u2019re not going to stop until people see there\u2019s a problem in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by Gizmodo Media Group\u2019s Special Projects Desk.

No one wants to mess up their sheets, bedding or mattress, so at the minimum, it is advised that you put a dark towel down to prevent staining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexologist and founder of the Women of Color Sexual Health Network Bianca Laureano suggests using tampons for other sorts of play and removing them for penetrative action.\n\nFor oral sex, she suggests using plastic wrap.\n\n\u201cCut off a big piece and lay the center on top of the vulva and let it sit there, taking in some of the body heat,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly, with one finger or something else, start at the mons where the hair grows under the belly button and gently bring the finger down the center of the vulva to hold the [plastic] wrap in place, then gently allow it to go into the folds and layers of the vulva for fuller and more enjoyable use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaureano says that the great thing about plastic wrap \u201cis you can use it whenever you want, and since it\u2019s not latex, you can put things that are oil-based on it without issue, such as hot fudge, massage oil, etc. This will elevate your safer-sex game.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests using gloves.\n\n\u201cIf you purchase them at tattoo suppliers, they are in various forms of rubber for those who have latex allergies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also come in different colors, and for some of us, nothing is hotter than a black glove being put on and the snap of the latex at the wrist! Give it a try. If all else fails, go to the beauty-supply store or dollar store and get gloves there; even the ones that come in the hair-dye box work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, she cautions about the aesthetics of scent and the heaviness of the menstrual flow.\n\n\u201cBe aware of your flow and your scent and be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you may not be aware of your scent, and you got to be open to your partners sharing if they are into it or not. If they are not, be ready to consider ways to remedy the situation for optimal outcomes, like showering\u2014together or solo; being \u2018cleaned up\u2019 by your lover, etc. Scent is a big thing for many of us who have this sensation, and we got to be ready to discuss this so if it does occur, we don\u2019t feel more hurt than need be. Sex is messy and smelly!\u201d\n\nSome suggest that there are benefits to period sex.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that period sex can actually lessen the pain of cramps, and this was corroborated by sexpert Michelle Hope of the O School. She had the following to say on the topic:\n\nThere are actually some benefits to period sex! For starters, there is some connection between orgasm and cramp relief. When we orgasm, our brain releases endorphins, which have been proven to change your mood and take you to a happy place! It is super cool that period sex can help with those pesky cramps because when we climax, our uterine muscles release chemicals to the brain that brings about natural pain relief. Additionally, during our periods, there is an increase in blood flow to the nether regions. That increased blood flow naturally happens when we are aroused, so being on your period is kinda like being a couple steps closer to orgasm even before you start getting frisky!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there any reasons a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex on her period?\n\nI asked Horvath-Cosper if there was any reason a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex during her period. The short answer was no.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe only reason to refrain from sex during a period is if you don\u2019t feel like having sex during your period. There\u2019s nothing weird, wrong or gross about period sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome people ... notice increased sex drive and better lubrication. All the other things that can make oral, vaginal and anal sex enjoyable\u2014closeness with your partner, pleasurable physical sensations, post-orgasm relaxation\u2014are still there during a period. I think there\u2019s a stigma about sex during menstruation that originates in misogynistic cultural narratives about women\u2019s bodies being \u2018unclean\u2019 or unhygienic during that time, but the fact is that menstrual blood is just blood, and isn\u2019t any different from the blood anywhere else in the body.\u201d\n\nThe experts have weighed in and given great advice on how to have safe and happy sex during your period.\n\n\n\nIf you and your partner are so inclined, I encourage you to go ahead and run that red light.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

Moreover, it\u2019s a lot easier to say that the ex is ruining things between Trump and America than to admit it\u2019s been his own muddy shoes on the couch that has the USA scrolling through NCAA prospects.\n\nAmid the political schadenfreude derived from watching the Trump administration burn, however, there is a worrisome feeling that one can\u2019t quite shake. Namely, how does this scandal actually end? And when it does, will that be any good for anybody? No matter how you slice it, the answer seems to be not anytime soon and no.\n\n\n\nThe Russian timeline with the Trump administration is pretty clear. Last spring the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails. Damaging information from the emails were put out through the world\u2019s pawn shop, WikiLeaks. Information came out at just the right time to damage and distract the Clinton campaign when it had momentum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo where do the almost half dozen members of the Trump campaign who met with Russian agents and ambassadors come in?\n\nCommon sense suggests that the Russians either shared the leaked documents or coordinated the leaked information with what the Trump campaign wanted out there. It doesn\u2019t matter how good Russian intelligence is\u2014only the Republicans would know exactly what was the best, most damaging information to drop on Clinton and when. And with the help of Steve Bannon and the Breitbart website, they\u2019d know exactly which far-right sites would pick up and normalize the information.\n\nThe intelligence community in the United States knows this, and it has been following Trump and his whole campaign for months. It already took out Michael Flynn; now it has vote-suppressor-in-chief Jeff Sessions, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is busted. The scandal will eventually make its way to Trump, which gives us three possible scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScenario 1: Trump Gets Impeached\n\nCongress appoints a special prosecutor, puts together a bipartisan commission on Russian hacking in the 2016 election, and decides that Trump\u2019s behavior and involvement with Russia rise to the level of \u201ctreason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d At this point Trump would be impeached and could be forced to leave the presidency. There are several problems with this scenario, however.\n\nFirst, a little Schoolhouse Rock civics lesson: A president can be impeached only by a majority vote in the House of Representatives. Then the case goes to trial in the Senate; the president can be removed only by a conviction there. Does anyone actually believe that House Speaker Paul Ryan would ever get around to impeaching Trump, let alone Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell holding a trial? Ryan knows that from now to the 2018 midterms is his window to turn America into an Ayn Rand/Heritage Foundation wet dream, and there\u2019s no way that happens if Trump isn\u2019t in office to distract \u201cworking-class whites\u201d with stories of Mexican rapists while Ryan and Congress snatch their health care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Donald Trump who got impeached but stayed in power would be a danger to everyone: He\u2019d be even more unhinged than he is now, and we\u2019d still have the same horrible actors in Congress. The economy would tank because of instability, and foreign powers would be even more aggressive, sensing that the U.S. is in absolute chaos. Not a good look all around.\n\nScenario 2: Congress Does Nothing\n\nWhat we see happening now in Congress is what I refer to as \u201cend of empire.\u201d When a domestic political group is more concerned with its power than with the actual sovereignty of the country, then you know the empire is crumbling from within.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Republican Party cares more about pushing through its policy agenda than about the fact that the nation has been compromised by Russian intelligence, white nationalists and people who literally want to start World War III. But hey, we gotta stop Obamacare, right?\n\nIt is possible that Congress does absolutely nothing and continues to scream \u201cNothing to see here\u201d while every Jason Bourne on the U.S. payroll is handing out Russian receipts like it\u2019s Black Friday. This would erode trust in the U.S. government by all but a few million maniacal right-wing bigots scattered across the nation, and lead to even more aggressive actions by our national security agencies.\n\nHow aggressive? Just bear in mind, the spymasters behind this country are more patriotic than partisan (not including FBI Director James Comey). They are more concerned with the future of American sovereignty and democracy than with who happens to run the country at any particular time, and they have concluded that Donald Trump is a threat to the 250-plus years of American government. No one knows how far this could go, but history tells us that a sitting president of the United States has never gone to war with our national security apparatus and come out the victor. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScenario 3: Trump Leaves Office\n\nDespite what the Alex Joneses of the world believe, there is no silent coup against Donald Trump. Obama is too busy play-fighting with Richard Branson and being adored by One Direction-style crowds with every public appearance to be orchestrating some grand plan against Trump. However, there is a potential coup right underneath Trump\u2019s nose that is much more likely to get him out of office and still cause this nation harm.\n\nCome on, don\u2019t these guys look like they\u2019re up to something?\n\nVice President Mike Pence was not Trump\u2019s first choice. Pence was lied to by former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and likely Trump, and is generally the odd man out. You can just imagine Pence finding out every week that there was a staff party with ice cream cake in the Oval Office and he just happened not to get the email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso consider that Paul Ryan is simply a better-looking version of Frank Underwood and he\u2019s never liked Trump. Is it really so hard to imagine a scenario in which, quietly, Pence and Ryan convince Republicans that Trump is so toxic that he poses a threat to their overall agenda? That they would use Russia leaks, a bad 2018 midterm or some other scandal to push for a Pence-Ryan presidency to emerge from the ashes of a failed Trump administration?\n\nThe problem, of course, is that Pence is just as dangerous and radical as Trump; he\u2019s just a better politician. Second, Trump is too rich and too powerful and has too much media savvy to go quietly into the night. If he\u2019s not in the White House, then he\u2019s going to cause as much havoc in this country as he can, and the disruption he might cause is more than anyone alive has ever experienced.\n\nSo in the end, what does this all mean? It means that the Russian scandal is serious and will likely result in some irreparable damage to the United States. Unfortunately, the result of these scandals might be even worse for the country than what we have now.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["panther", "feel", "film", "theyre", "consciousness", "carter", "felt", "marveldisney", "cultural", "costumes", "ruth", "know", "wannabes", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

Bono told Pence, \u201cTwice on the House floor you defended that. That\u2019s how we know you, and we really appreciate that.\u201d In response, Pence said, \u201cIt was an extraordinary historic accomplishment, and you played a leading role in carrying it forward.\u201d\n\nBono then jokingly referred to Pence as \u201cthe second-busiest man in America.\u201d Somewhere, Stephen Bannon, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner, Reince Preibus and Ivanka Trump\u2019s declining businesses are all saying, \u201cBitch, you tried it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one can question Bono\u2019s commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa. However, if one is dedicated to battling AIDS all over the world, why would anyone salute a man whose stubbornness helped create the worst HIV outbreak in his state\u2019s history as governor? In 2013, then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence slashed public health spending, which led to the closure of Planned Parenthood in Scott County\u2014the only facility that provided HIV testing in that county.\n\nThen, in 2015, HIV was spreading at alarming rates among intravenous drug users in a rural area of the state. Local, state and federal health officials all urged the governor to allow clean needles to be distributed to help thwart the outbreak. Pence initially refused to allow needle exchanges because he believed they helped spread drug use. It would be months before Pence changed his mind, and even then, it was insufficient.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Politico\u2019s Paul Demko reported:\n\nWith new cases mounting, Pence eventually agreed to extend the amnesty in Scott County beyond 30 days and to sign statewide legislation lifting the state ban on exchange programs. That compromise did not give counties a green light to distribute sterile needles to intravenous drug users, however. Instead, it requires officials from counties experiencing increasing HIV or hepatitis C infections to declare a public health emergency and then submit a plan for state approval to set up needle-exchange programs for up to one year. The legislation didn\u2019t include any money to assist counties, many of which are rural and already struggling. And it explicitly prohibited using state funds to purchase syringes. \u201cHe was dragged kicking and screaming into signing the bill that we got passed,\u201d said Rep. Patrick Bauer, a Democrat who serves on the public health committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year after the legislation was passed, only five counties put needle-exchange programs in place, but \u201ctwo dozen took steps to set them up, according to the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention.\u201d Many of these people were assisted thanks to Obamacare\u2019s expanded Medicaid program\u2014the very program Pence is now seeking to dismantle.\n\n\n\nOf course, Pence is the same person who now disputes past support of conversion therapy but nonetheless has a long history of anti-LGBTQ stances. And since Bono has an affinity for the Pence of the previous decade, in 2002, Pence claimed that \u201ccondoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases\u201d while arguing that using condoms as a solution to STDs was \u201ctoo modern.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile speaking with Wolf Blitzer, Pence was asked for his opinion of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s push for STD prevention with wider condom access. Pence said:\n\nWell, I just simply believe the only truly safe sex, Wolf, as the president believes, is no sex. And we ought to, with leaders of the stature of the secretary of state, we ought to be sending a message to kids across the country and the opportunity had across the world that abstinence is the best choice for young people. But, let\u2019s be clear, last year, the National Institute of Health, Wolf, and some 28 separate experts said at least a half dozen to 10 sexually transmitted diseases for which condom use has zero preventative value. The secretary of state is simply wrong. The problem is it was too modern of an answer, Wolf. It was\u2014it truly was a modern, liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over America, and frankly, all over the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeft Eye didn\u2019t wear a condom on her face for such a gross public display of stupidity.\n\n\n\nBono can be pleased with Pence\u2019s support of PEPFAR in years past, but after that introduction, a more informed opinion of his work would show that he is no friend to causes that seek to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\nAny good Pence did on behalf of PEPFAR ought to be negated by what he\u2019s done in Indiana and what he plans to do as vice president in a Republican administration committed to soiling an already fledgling health care industry. Don\u2019t laud that man for minimal displays of basic decency.

You are free to Google the organization\u2019s name and take a look for yourself, but let me provide you with a snippet from its \u201cmission statement\u201d:\n\nWe work to promote a colorblind society, one within which race and skin color are no longer an issue and so accordingly we oppose admission, hiring, and contracting policies that discriminate, sort, or prefer on the basis of race or ethnicity. We oppose racial gerrymandering. We oppose bilingual education, because it segregates students by national origin, encourages identity politics, and fails to teach children English\u2014the single most important skill they can learn and the most important social glue holding our country together. And, whatever one believes to be an acceptable level of immigration, all should agree that those coming to America must become Americans, and this means that assimilation is not a dirty word, but a national necessity.\n\nRead it twice so you get where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nAgain, none of this is being done in secret. The Department of Education, under the monster that is Betsy DeVos, has already said that it plans to scale back on investigations of civil rights violations at the nation\u2019s public schools and universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAccording to an internal memo issued by Candice E. Jackson, the acting head of the department\u2019s office for civil rights, requirements that investigators broaden their inquiries to identify systemic issues and whole classes of victims will be scaled back. Also, regional offices will no longer be required to alert department officials in Washington of all highly sensitive complaints on issues such as the disproportionate disciplining of minority students and the mishandling of sexual assaults on college campuses.\n\nAre you paying attention? Are you seeing what they are doing here?\n\nThey are creating a fast track to the return of Jim Crow. They won\u2019t call it Jim Crow; they consider it making American \u201cgreat\u201d again, but as I said before, it is Jim Crow in a red hat and a bloated white body, wielding its power over marginalized communities no matter how you look at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake away access to education. Remove restrictions that prevent discrimination in hiring and housing. Crack down on small-time drug dealers and people in poor communities in every way you can.\n\nCreate a system in which there is no way for people to break out of the systems of poverty that hold them down.\n\nTake away health care. Cut down on social programs that help the poor.\n\nMake it OK for an already militarized police force to create a police state in which we have no defense against their aggressions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue to open private prisons. Funnel the oppressed and those committing small crimes into that system. Create a new system of chattel slavery that profits off of white supremacy.\n\nCall it justice, because it has all been enabled by the \u201cJustice\u201d Department.\n\nSit back and watch their master, or your master\u2019s, plan at work.\n\nBe afraid.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. Here we speak with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to reduce the harm of white supremacy? How can we, as a society, look beyond drug abuse as an illness and reckon with anti-black oppression, punishment and capitalism as the cruelest addictions in this country?\n\n\n\nIn that context, white supremacy is the pusher, but black people aren\u2019t the ones with the habit.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014is an expert in the field of African-American and public health history and politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts is currently researching a book project on the history of drug-addiction policy and politics from the 1950s to the present, a period that encompasses the various heroin epidemics between the 1950s and the 1980s, therapeutic communities, radical recovery movements, methadone maintenance treatment and harm-reduction approaches.\n\n\n\nRoberts\u2019 focus on harm reduction for people of color encompasses much more than ensuring individual safety; rather, it is about dismantling systems that are unsafe for black people in the United States of America.\n\n\n\nIn our wide-ranging interview, Roberts and I discussed radical recovery; the critical need for \u201charm reduction of color\u201d to end the so-called war on drugs, which has always been a war against the most oppressed and has targeted black and brown communities; and why \u201cwhite flight\u201d is a misnomer that gives entirely too much credit to whiteness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Let\u2019s talk about the critical need for harm reduction of color. Because that specificity and intentionality, that reframing, is not something that is discussed enough.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr.: Yes, HROC, harm reduction of color, is a specific view. Harm-reduction-of-color critique in particular is concerned with structural inequality. So it recognizes the whole social issues of drugs and the political aspects of drugs as being bound up with structures that are in place, with the effect and the function of maintaining inequality for people of color and communities of color.\n\n\n\nFrom this view, we see that there\u2019s a connection between a failing education system, hypervigilant state security systems, the mass carceral state, and deindustrialization and lack of job opportunities. Those are all connected structurally in our harm-reduction-of-color critique. I emphasize harm reduction of color because there are harm-reduction organizations that are just about helping people stay safe as they use drugs, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But that\u2019s very different from what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a protest movement in many ways, or at least an advocacy movement that will ... do that seamless analysis of gender and sexual oppression, economic subjugation and mass incarceration, police brutality\u2014you know, the whole nine. HROC is a political analysis that draws from a decadeslong history of radical movements from the \u201960s and \u201970s and forward, but also drawn more immediately from the energy and analyses offered by the various movements, including the Movement for Black Lives.\n\n\n\nTR: Absolutely, and a large part of that is eradicating the racialized stigma attached to drug use. Not just the stigma, but also poverty, criminalization and addiction ... it\u2019s a lot to dismantle and to reckon with. And in the context of white supremacy, these are radical notions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. An HROC perspective recognizes that stigma actually has a function. That if you\u2019re gonna rationalize locking up 2 million people at any given point in time, as this country has, you have to have an ideology that convinces people that they\u2019re OK with that. So you need to have a series of stigmas about there being violent, predatorial, bad mothers; drains on the welfare state, cheats, you know, unwilling to work, animalistic\u2014all of those things, you know; potential or active terrorists. You need to have all of those in place if you\u2019re gonna get people to sign off on all that, because let\u2019s be clear: Putting together a carceral state is not easy.\n\n\n\nHas anyone been successful convincing the American public to put tens of billions of dollars behind the educational system? No. It\u2019s a lot to convince people to put in that kind of money. So you have to have them scared, and you have to have them thinking that the people against whom the stigmas are being mobilized are really not worthy of any sympathy or any respect, really.\n\nTR: What really stood out to me while reading over your synopsis of your book research was the term \u201cradical recovery.\u201d I\u2019m thinking here about mothers who may lose their job or the father who may have his children taken away. People stand to pay a steep price for speaking out about their addictions, and that can suppress recovery. Can you talk a little bit about the history of radical recovery in movement spaces?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Well, since the ... mid- to late \u201960s, we\u2019ve had a number of instances in which organizations have tied the issue of drugs, drug use, drug policy, to larger socioeconomic and political questions. So the radical part here is, we\u2019re not just talking about plain recovery. A lot of recovery programs are not political, and that\u2019s fine. In fact, some are actually very much, assertively anti-political. In most of your 12-step programs, you don\u2019t come in there talking politics, you know what I mean? Because for them, that detracts or distracts you from your own responsibility and problems.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s other organizations that were supported by the Black Panthers and the Young Lords. There was a group called White Lightning, which was an anti-racist, largely white organization. These organizations and other, smaller ones, made the connection between drug use in what was then called America\u2019s ghettos and later called inner cities, or center cities where jobs are basically fleeing. You know, we talk about white flight from neighborhoods, but it\u2019s not so much white flight that\u2019s a problem; it\u2019s capital flight.\n\n\n\nThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people. It\u2019s that all the money left, right? All the jobs left. At the same time, for a young, employable population, if one of the only games in town is the drug trade, well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Exactly, and that carried right on over into later decades.\n\n\n\nSKR: Right. In the \u201980s and \u201990s, you know, a number of things happened. First we get HIV ... by the early 1980s, heroin has taken such a toll in black communities\u2014not just heroin use itself, but also the police ramifications that many in our mainstream leadership pushed, the politics of respectability.\n\n\n\nThey basically washed their hands of people who used drugs, and they washed their hands of the issues, any issue besides law and order. And then you combine that with [Ronald] Reagan\u2019s war on drugs, which wasn\u2019t just about locking people up for using drugs; it actually ended up remaking governance itself. And what I mean by that is, imagine a period of time where the surest way you\u2019re gonna get grants from the federal government is to do drug interdiction. Not education, public health\u2014remember, Reagan was cutting down all those; not job training, not community development\u2014Reagan was slashing budgets for all that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one thing, if you needed anybody from the federal government to balance your municipal budget, you had to ... basically ask for drug money or drug fighting, drug-war money. So after a few decades of that, then if all you\u2019re carrying is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people.\u201d\n\nTR: Absolutely; the same held true for Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularization of John DiIulio Jr.\u2019s term \u201csuperpredator.\u201d Under Clinton, states began passing their own version of \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, and they were awarded Truth-in-Sentencing grants to build and expand prisons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. Clinton had the same enthusiasm for all those policies.\n\n\n\nTR: So let\u2019s talk about this country\u2019s commitment to punishment, capitalism and anti-blackness and how it has fueled the so-called drug war\u2014because we know it\u2019s really a war on the most targeted black and brown communities in the country. Now we have this \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs for white users, but it remains punishment for black people who sell drugs.\n\n\n\nSKR: So we do have to be careful here. Since 1973, with the Rockefeller drug laws, our impulse to separate drug users from so-called drug dealers is actually a pretty artificial one. Most people who use drugs at some point have sold drugs, even if mostly casually. And most people who sell drugs really are doing it just for side money and to support their own habit. So what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s very difficult to separate drug dealers from drug users.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of people who just use drugs and they never sold it. There are people out there who sell drugs and don\u2019t use. But with the majority, there is this overlap. The number of people that we would describe as \u201cking pins\u201d or major distributors is a pretty small number. So we have to be careful with separating the user from the seller, because all discretion is with the prosecution.\n\n\n\nTR: That\u2019s an excellent point. White drug use is primarily a public health issue, even though these white people also sell small quantities of drugs. Black drug sellers, even in small quantities, are hypercriminalized because our judicial system chooses to not see them as users. And if it does, there is stigma attached.\n\n\n\nSKR: And that\u2019s the danger of it, right? Because so much of it is in the eye of the beholder. At what point is somebody a user and at what point are they a dealer? If we decide as a society that we\u2019re going to take a public health approach to drug using, but continue to take a draconian approach to drug dealing, then we really haven\u2019t [done] as much reform as we\u2019ve thought. We can\u2019t demonize one and empathize with the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you have a white woman who has developed a heroin problem and on the side she\u2019s selling a little bit of heroin to maintain her own habit, somebody might say, \u201cOh, this poor woman; we need to get her a program because she\u2019s not really a dealer.\u201d You can take a black woman in the same case, but it\u2019ll conjure up all these myths of crack moms and black women are terrible mothers, and she gets the book thrown at her.\n\n\n\nHalf a measure of reform is not the full thing. For most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking here about [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw and how he targeted black women, specifically black women with criminal charges or who had battled some form of addiction and were afraid of being incarcerated. He used his power to do that. We could also look at women who are addicted to drugs and how some of them are not involved in sex work because it\u2019s something that they want to do, necessarily, but something that they need to do to survive.\n\nYou look at what [former Gov.] Mike Pence did in Indiana, stopping the needle-exchange programs and limiting women\u2019s access to reproductive choices, and how that affected women of color and exploded the HIV rate. There is a dangerous intersection of criminalization and misogyny, particularly as it pertains to black women. Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this is not only a public health issue for black women, or a criminal issue, but a feminist issue.\n\n\n\nSKR: Absolutely. There\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s.\n\n\n\nBlack women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Absolutely. Poverty is also a systemic illness that affects personal wellness in black and brown working-class communities and those living in deep poverty. And while there has been some movement on policy around the country, do you think there has been progress eradicating the intentional stigmas that fuel this oppression?\n\nSKR: Yes, one of the many inspiring things about the Movement for Black Lives is the high proportion of black women, queer and/or trans, in the leadership of these organizations. Because with them comes a very complex and sophisticated analysis of various problems and an ability to connect all those.\n\n\n\nSo if you want to talk to someone, if you want to get some of the most sophisticated analysis of sexual violence and sexual politics, drug policy, war on the poor and war on black people, you talk to a trans activist of color who works with homeless youth. Because they\u2019ve seen all of those things, and it can show how they all seamlessly work in this really hideous system that\u2019s essentially designed to brutalize entire populations. These are individuals that were not in the forefront of black political mobilization even 15 years ago, let alone 50 years ago, at the height of the civil rights movement. We are in a really creative movement in terms of black politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\u201d\n\nTR: There are a lot of tentacles deeply rooted in the history of black people in the United States that have been shaped by the so-called war on drugs. What does winning this war look like to you?\n\n\n\nSKR: Massive investment in education, obviously, right? But we also need to think about how we plan an economy where there are industries waiting for people who have that education. And that\u2019s gonna take a lot of political will as well. And we need to think about our health infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you started off our conversation, where you were saying poverty as a disease ... being poor is probably the most dangerous threat to your health. ... And so we ... need to really work on that infrastructure. Most of the issues that we attribute to drug use will be vastly mitigated if we paid more attention to these other things. When you give people more tools with which they can be in control of their lives, they tend to not be as harmful to themselves or to others. And, in this moment, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there.\n\n\n\nThe so-called war on drugs has been exposed for the capitalist money grab and the white supremacist assault that it is. And this I know to be true: It is our duty to win. We will not allow stigma to infest our communities, and we will continue to fight back when we see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will have greater empathy for those who make the decision to self-medicate the pain of struggling to survive in an anti-black society. And we will focus on radical recovery because the shame is not ours, and it never has been.\n\nWe will look at poverty as an illness and not a moral failing, and we will insist, to others and to ourselves, that our humanity in the face of intentional institutional violence and oppression is always worth fighting for.", "keywords": ["jr", "white", "radical", "war", "roberts", "flight", "scholar", "need", "policy", "drug", "women", "history", "recovery", "k", "drugs", "really", "samuel", "black"], "polarity": 0.045231531208974815, "subjectivity": 0.4546037713330948},

I\u2019ve heard it called \u201crunning the red light,\u201d \u201criding the red river,\u201d \u201cfighting a bloody battle\u201d and \u201cearning your red badge of courage,\u201d but no matter what you call it, period sex is and has always been a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople engage in both oral sex and penetration with their female partners who are menstruating.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone. I don\u2019t engage in it, because I am a moody bitch who does not want to be bothered, much less touched, during my period. The crazy part is that I am also the horniest during my period, and I can\u2019t be the only one this happens to, so that could explain why this is a thing.\n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider when engaging in period sex. There are safety, comfort and cleanliness issues to take into consideration, but as long as you go into it armed with useful information, you can create a pleasurable experience for both partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSafety is key.\n\nThe No. 1 thing to consider when having period sex is the safety and health of you and your partner. Dr. Ruth Ann Crystal and Dr. Diane J. Horvath-Cosper, both gynecologists, caution that menstrual blood can carry infections like HIV and hepatitis B.\n\n\u201cThe cervix is slightly more open during your period, so it may make it easier to get an STI [sexually transmitted infection],\u201d Crystal said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf a person is trying to reduce their risk of sexually transmitted infection, it\u2019s important to use barrier methods [condoms, dental dams] ALL the time, including during menstruation. It\u2019s also important to note that menstruation isn\u2019t a contraceptive method. While it\u2019s unlikely that someone could become pregnant during a period, it\u2019s not impossible. and care should be taken if pregnancy isn\u2019t desired,\u201d Horvath-Cosper said.\n\nOnce you have taken all the necessary safety precautions, getting down to the actual act can also take some preparation.\n\nThe logistics of period sex.\n\nObviously, we all know that period sex can be very messy. No one wants to mess up their sheets, bedding or mattress, so at the minimum, it is advised that you put a dark towel down to prevent staining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexologist and founder of the Women of Color Sexual Health Network Bianca Laureano suggests using tampons for other sorts of play and removing them for penetrative action.\n\nFor oral sex, she suggests using plastic wrap.\n\n\u201cCut off a big piece and lay the center on top of the vulva and let it sit there, taking in some of the body heat,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly, with one finger or something else, start at the mons where the hair grows under the belly button and gently bring the finger down the center of the vulva to hold the [plastic] wrap in place, then gently allow it to go into the folds and layers of the vulva for fuller and more enjoyable use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaureano says that the great thing about plastic wrap \u201cis you can use it whenever you want, and since it\u2019s not latex, you can put things that are oil-based on it without issue, such as hot fudge, massage oil, etc. This will elevate your safer-sex game.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests using gloves.\n\n\u201cIf you purchase them at tattoo suppliers, they are in various forms of rubber for those who have latex allergies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also come in different colors, and for some of us, nothing is hotter than a black glove being put on and the snap of the latex at the wrist! Give it a try. If all else fails, go to the beauty-supply store or dollar store and get gloves there; even the ones that come in the hair-dye box work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, she cautions about the aesthetics of scent and the heaviness of the menstrual flow.\n\n\u201cBe aware of your flow and your scent and be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you may not be aware of your scent, and you got to be open to your partners sharing if they are into it or not. If they are not, be ready to consider ways to remedy the situation for optimal outcomes, like showering\u2014together or solo; being \u2018cleaned up\u2019 by your lover, etc. Scent is a big thing for many of us who have this sensation, and we got to be ready to discuss this so if it does occur, we don\u2019t feel more hurt than need be. Sex is messy and smelly!\u201d\n\nSome suggest that there are benefits to period sex.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that period sex can actually lessen the pain of cramps, and this was corroborated by sexpert Michelle Hope of the O School. She had the following to say on the topic:\n\nThere are actually some benefits to period sex! For starters, there is some connection between orgasm and cramp relief. When we orgasm, our brain releases endorphins, which have been proven to change your mood and take you to a happy place! It is super cool that period sex can help with those pesky cramps because when we climax, our uterine muscles release chemicals to the brain that brings about natural pain relief. Additionally, during our periods, there is an increase in blood flow to the nether regions. That increased blood flow naturally happens when we are aroused, so being on your period is kinda like being a couple steps closer to orgasm even before you start getting frisky!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there any reasons a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex on her period?\n\nI asked Horvath-Cosper if there was any reason a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex during her period. The short answer was no.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe only reason to refrain from sex during a period is if you don\u2019t feel like having sex during your period. There\u2019s nothing weird, wrong or gross about period sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome people ... notice increased sex drive and better lubrication. All the other things that can make oral, vaginal and anal sex enjoyable\u2014closeness with your partner, pleasurable physical sensations, post-orgasm relaxation\u2014are still there during a period. I think there\u2019s a stigma about sex during menstruation that originates in misogynistic cultural narratives about women\u2019s bodies being \u2018unclean\u2019 or unhygienic during that time, but the fact is that menstrual blood is just blood, and isn\u2019t any different from the blood anywhere else in the body.\u201d\n\nThe experts have weighed in and given great advice on how to have safe and happy sex during your period.\n\n\n\nIf you and your partner are so inclined, I encourage you to go ahead and run that red light.

She conquered.\n\n\n\nActress Viola Davis, who has been thrilling audiences with her passionate, deeply felt words since at least 2017 (or that year she made us all cry at the Oscars), gave no less at the Women\u2019s March 2018 in Los Angeles this past Saturday.\n\nDecked out in a leather jacket; big, beautiful hair; and the fierceness of a life lived (and don\u2019t @ me for talking about how she looked\u2014at 52, she looks too damn good!), Davis gave thousands of pink-pussy-hat wearers something to talk\u2014and think\u2014about.\n\nDavis opened by saying, \u201cIn the words of my fellow American Malcolm X, I\u2019m gonna make it plain.\u201d\n\nOK, Viola. We are listening. Because opening with Malcolm means it\u2019s about to go down.\n\nShe followed up by calling the United States the greatest nation on earth, but reminding us: \u201cIn 1877, America put laws in place called the Jim Crow laws,\u201d and those laws \u201crestricted the rights of quadroons, octoroons, blacks, Hispanics, Malays ... they restricted medical, relationships, education, in all, \u201cthey restricted life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also quoted Martin Luther King Jr., and then she got animated, telling the crowd that the price of freedom is certainly not free.\n\n\u201cWe only move forward when it doesn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.\u201d\n\nShe noted that women of color, if they are raped or sexually assaulted before the age of 18, are 66 percent more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of girls who are sexually trafficked are girls of color,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey are coming out of the foster care system, they are coming out of poverty. It is a billion-dollar business.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe, like Oprah, called the names of activist and organizer Fannie Lou Hamer; of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men; of Rosa Parks; of activist Tarana Burke\u2014saying their work, their sacrifice, cost them something.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing and no one can be great without a cost,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis closed by getting personal and saying that her testimony was that of one of those young girls of color who grew up in poverty and who was sexually violated:\n\nI am always introduced as an award-winning actor. But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth. That\u2019s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence. That\u2019s what allows me to even be a citizen on this planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, hammering the point home, she said ain\u2019t nobody free till we all free.\n\n\u201cAs we live on earth, we\u2019ve got to bring everyone with us,\u201d said Davis.\n\nBrava, Ms. Davis.

It\u2019s only been a day, after all, since new Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb removed the wrongfully placed stain from his record, a stain put there because of a violent armed robbery Cooper did not commit, but for which he spent nearly a decade in prison.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the Chicago Tribune reports, Cooper finally spoke out about his wrongful conviction, trying to put into words what his pardon means to him.\n\n\u201cI got my name back,\u201d the 49-year-old told reporters at a news conference. \u201cI walked to the store and never came back. It was hard. It was a hard journey for us all and being that I missed out on my kids growing up.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s daughter, wife, former wife, mother, and several other relatives and supporters stood beside him as he made his statements.\n\nCooper (and Holcomb) made news Thursday after the governor wiped Cooper\u2019s record clean of a 1996 armed robbery conviction. Holcomb accomplished in less than a month what now-Vice President Mike Pence left hanging in limbo for three years and ultimately left his gubernatorial office without acting upon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper thanked Holcomb for his decisive action on Friday, while expressing how Pence\u2019s lack of action made him feel.\n\n\u201cHe should have apologized and gave me the pardon,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful that [Holcomb] had the heart to do what Pence couldn\u2019t do. He left me. He abandoned me. But thanks to Gov. Holcomb, I\u2019m free again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd make no mistake, Pence did abandon Cooper. DNA evidence had long ago pointed to another man as the shooter, and the victims and the former prosecutor who helped put Cooper behind bars have long had a change of heart and declared Cooper innocent, making pleas on his behalf. In March 2014, the Indiana Parole Board unanimously recommended that Pence grant the pardon.\n\nAnd yet, in September 2016, Pence\u2019s general counsel told Cooper that he must first go through all possible judicial options before the then-governor would act on the pardon request.\n\nThankfully, Holcomb is much more efficient than Pence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.\n\n", "keywords": ["man", "told", "wrongfully", "left", "pence", "ind", "cooper", "holcomb", "pardon", "tribune", "convicted", "abandoned", "stain", "wife", "robbery"], "polarity": 0.037943722943722946, "subjectivity": 0.3775108225108225},

I\u2019ve heard it called \u201crunning the red light,\u201d \u201criding the red river,\u201d \u201cfighting a bloody battle\u201d and \u201cearning your red badge of courage,\u201d but no matter what you call it, period sex is and has always been a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople engage in both oral sex and penetration with their female partners who are menstruating.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone. I don\u2019t engage in it, because I am a moody bitch who does not want to be bothered, much less touched, during my period. The crazy part is that I am also the horniest during my period, and I can\u2019t be the only one this happens to, so that could explain why this is a thing.\n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider when engaging in period sex. There are safety, comfort and cleanliness issues to take into consideration, but as long as you go into it armed with useful information, you can create a pleasurable experience for both partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSafety is key.\n\nThe No. 1 thing to consider when having period sex is the safety and health of you and your partner. Dr. Ruth Ann Crystal and Dr. Diane J. Horvath-Cosper, both gynecologists, caution that menstrual blood can carry infections like HIV and hepatitis B.\n\n\u201cThe cervix is slightly more open during your period, so it may make it easier to get an STI [sexually transmitted infection],\u201d Crystal said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf a person is trying to reduce their risk of sexually transmitted infection, it\u2019s important to use barrier methods [condoms, dental dams] ALL the time, including during menstruation. It\u2019s also important to note that menstruation isn\u2019t a contraceptive method. While it\u2019s unlikely that someone could become pregnant during a period, it\u2019s not impossible. and care should be taken if pregnancy isn\u2019t desired,\u201d Horvath-Cosper said.\n\nOnce you have taken all the necessary safety precautions, getting down to the actual act can also take some preparation.\n\nThe logistics of period sex.\n\nObviously, we all know that period sex can be very messy. No one wants to mess up their sheets, bedding or mattress, so at the minimum, it is advised that you put a dark towel down to prevent staining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexologist and founder of the Women of Color Sexual Health Network Bianca Laureano suggests using tampons for other sorts of play and removing them for penetrative action.\n\nFor oral sex, she suggests using plastic wrap.\n\n\u201cCut off a big piece and lay the center on top of the vulva and let it sit there, taking in some of the body heat,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly, with one finger or something else, start at the mons where the hair grows under the belly button and gently bring the finger down the center of the vulva to hold the [plastic] wrap in place, then gently allow it to go into the folds and layers of the vulva for fuller and more enjoyable use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaureano says that the great thing about plastic wrap \u201cis you can use it whenever you want, and since it\u2019s not latex, you can put things that are oil-based on it without issue, such as hot fudge, massage oil, etc. This will elevate your safer-sex game.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests using gloves.\n\n\u201cIf you purchase them at tattoo suppliers, they are in various forms of rubber for those who have latex allergies,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also come in different colors, and for some of us, nothing is hotter than a black glove being put on and the snap of the latex at the wrist! Give it a try. If all else fails, go to the beauty-supply store or dollar store and get gloves there; even the ones that come in the hair-dye box work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, she cautions about the aesthetics of scent and the heaviness of the menstrual flow.\n\n\u201cBe aware of your flow and your scent and be honest,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you may not be aware of your scent, and you got to be open to your partners sharing if they are into it or not. If they are not, be ready to consider ways to remedy the situation for optimal outcomes, like showering\u2014together or solo; being \u2018cleaned up\u2019 by your lover, etc. Scent is a big thing for many of us who have this sensation, and we got to be ready to discuss this so if it does occur, we don\u2019t feel more hurt than need be. Sex is messy and smelly!\u201d\n\nSome suggest that there are benefits to period sex.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that period sex can actually lessen the pain of cramps, and this was corroborated by sexpert Michelle Hope of the O School. She had the following to say on the topic:\n\nThere are actually some benefits to period sex! For starters, there is some connection between orgasm and cramp relief. When we orgasm, our brain releases endorphins, which have been proven to change your mood and take you to a happy place! It is super cool that period sex can help with those pesky cramps because when we climax, our uterine muscles release chemicals to the brain that brings about natural pain relief. Additionally, during our periods, there is an increase in blood flow to the nether regions. That increased blood flow naturally happens when we are aroused, so being on your period is kinda like being a couple steps closer to orgasm even before you start getting frisky!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there any reasons a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex on her period?\n\nI asked Horvath-Cosper if there was any reason a woman shouldn\u2019t have sex during her period. The short answer was no.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe only reason to refrain from sex during a period is if you don\u2019t feel like having sex during your period. There\u2019s nothing weird, wrong or gross about period sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome people ... notice increased sex drive and better lubrication. All the other things that can make oral, vaginal and anal sex enjoyable\u2014closeness with your partner, pleasurable physical sensations, post-orgasm relaxation\u2014are still there during a period. I think there\u2019s a stigma about sex during menstruation that originates in misogynistic cultural narratives about women\u2019s bodies being \u2018unclean\u2019 or unhygienic during that time, but the fact is that menstrual blood is just blood, and isn\u2019t any different from the blood anywhere else in the body.\u201d\n\nThe experts have weighed in and given great advice on how to have safe and happy sex during your period.\n\n\n\nIf you and your partner are so inclined, I encourage you to go ahead and run that red light.

Mike Pence to use his executive power to issue a pardon and remove the mark from his record, to no avail. On Thursday, Pence\u2019s replacement, Republican Eric Holcomb, got the job done.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Cooper, 49, was convicted of armed robbery in 1997, and Holcomb said Thursday that he was pardoning Cooper for a crime of which he was innocent.\n\n\u201cI am very much at peace pardoning him,\u201d Holcomb said at a news conference. \u201cI believe he is innocent of that crime.\u201d\n\nHolcomb pardoned Cooper for the armed robbery conviction, but not a battery conviction for which he also asked for a pardon, according to the IndyStar. Of the battery charge, to which he pleaded guilty, Cooper said that he was defending himself against another inmate while in jail for the robbery charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter careful and thoughtful consideration and review\u2014something I\u2019ve thought about every day over the last month\u2014just earlier today I issued a pardon to Mr. Keith Cooper for his past and, I believe, wrongful armed robbery felony,\u201d Holcomb said. \u201cI did so because since that conviction in 1997, many pieces of information that were out and about that had been brought forward since have changed, including a victim, an informant, even the deputy prosecutor who convicted Mr. Cooper on that first crime; all have stated support or no objection to a pardon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolcomb said that a deputy prosecutor wrote a letter in support of Cooper, and eyewitnesses who helped to convict Cooper have since come forward to say that they were wrong.\n\nThe Indiana Parole Board unanimously recommended a pardon several years ago, Holcomb said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s for all of these reasons and personally believing that Mr. Cooper has waited long enough and needs not endure any further uncertainty that I issue this pardon this morning for the robbery conviction only, not the battery conviction,\u201d the governor told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Post, Cooper was arrested in January 1997 for attempted murder and armed robbery in a crime that happened at an apartment complex in Elkhart, Ind. Cooper and another man, Christopher Parish, were accused of committing the crime by police, but Cooper maintained that he had never met Parish.\n\nCooper, who reportedly fit the description of one of the suspects, was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison; Parish was convicted and sentenced to 30 years.\n\nYears later, new evidence surfaced that proved Cooper\u2019s innocence, including DNA from a hat left by one of the armed robbers. That DNA was later traced to another man who matched Cooper\u2019s physical description and who committed a murder in Michigan years after the Elkhart crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, victims and eyewitnesses recanted their original statements and accused the Elkhart police detective investigating the crime of manipulating them into identifying Cooper.\n\nAfter spending nearly a decade in prison, Cooper was released in 2006, but the felony remained on his record.\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nLast year, Cooper\u2019s attorney filed a petition for post-conviction relief, arguing that \u201can avalanche of new evidence\u201d entitled Cooper to a new trial. That includes DNA evidence, recantations from victims and witnesses and most recently, a crucial letter from the attorney who prosecuted Cooper in 1997. Michael Christofeno, a former Elkhart County deputy prosecutor, had written the letter to Pence, saying: \u201cJustice demands that Mr. Cooper be pardoned. We cannot undo the wrongful imprisonment of Mr. Cooper, but we can undo his wrongful conviction with a pardon,\u201d according to the IndyStar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPence denied the request, and his general counsel wrote a letter saying that Cooper\u2019s request was \u201cextraordinary,\u201d so the judicial process would have to run its course before the governor could step in.\n\nUm, what?\n\nYou have a mountain of evidence proving that this man is innocent of the crime he was charged with. You have witnesses and a prosecutor saying that he should have his name cleared, but the judicial process needed to run its course?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, right.\n\nHolcomb, who was sworn in Jan. 9, issued the pardon within four weeks of being in office.\n\nElliot Slosar, Cooper\u2019s attorney, said in an email to the Post: \u201cWe are elated that in four short weeks Governor Holcomb was able to provide justice for Keith Cooper and the other victims.

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["white", "music", "im", "reasons", "raised", "household", "shit", "glad", "grew", "ive", "know", "dont", "think", "black"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

Passing Strange (2008)\n\nMore known for his fictional films, Lee is also an accomplished documentarian. This is a recording of \u201cthe best play to never win a Tony,\u201d written by Stew.\n\n\n\n20. Jim Brown: All-American (2002)\n\nJim Brown is a fascinatingly complicated black man, and Lee\u2019s documentary lays that all bare.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth (2013)\n\nThis film surprised me. Mike Tyson is a tragically flawed yet magnetically charismatic man\u2014Lee films him empathetically.\n\n18. Summer of Sam (1999)\n\nThis tells the story of the 1977 serial murders that took place in New York City. It builds suspense competently, but I have no idea what Lee was trying to say with the film. His visuals are jarring, yet what good are the chills if the story leaves so much to be desired?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Get on the Bus (1996)\n\nThis story about black men on a bus to the Million Man March flirts dangerously with emotional manipulation, but the performances of Ossie Davis, Charles S. Dutton, Bernie Mac, Andre Braugher and others save the film from sentimentality.\n\n\n\n16. Clockers (1995)\n\nAn examination of the interconnectedness of those who investigate crimes and those who commit them, Lee\u2019s Clockers is a precursor to The Wire in form and style.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. If God Is Willing and de Creek Don\u2019t Rise (2010)\n\nThis sequel to Lee\u2019s brilliant When the Levees Broke is haunting. It showed us just how much work remained to be done after Hurricane Katrina while examining the impact of the BP oil spill of 2010. His ability to construct a vibrant narrative using the documentary format is on full display in this HBO film.\n\nThe remaining films are what made Spike Lee Spike Lee. The following are all legitimately great films worthy of deep examination and deconstruction. My ranking of his top 14 films changes almost yearly, but I am willing to go to blows with anyone who denies their brilliance\u2014even while I am willing to admit that they are not all flawless in their execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. 25th Hour (2002)\n\nA rarity for Lee in that almost exclusively white actors populate it, this film grapples brilliantly with the moral nihilism that we all felt in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\n\n13. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nThis felt like Lee just wanted to say something about interracial relationships\u2014essentially that they would not work. But yo, this movie is riveting. The directorial flair, the acting, the music and the fact that \u201cjungle fever\u201d is now a part of the public lexicon places this firmly in the upper echelon of his filmography.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Inside Man (2006)\n\nDenzel Washington, Lee\u2019s frequent collaborator, is electric and makes the film work, but at this point in his career, this is a movie that I did not think Lee would make. A fun potboiler that shows us what is possible when Lee cuts back on his self-indulgent tendencies and focuses on a narrative.\n\n\n\n11. Bamboozled (2000)\n\nThis satire examines the vicious legacy of blackface in light of contemporary depictions of black Americans in popular media. It took me years to fully appreciate what Lee was up to, but now, looking back as a philosopher of race, I see that Lee\u2019s film is both prophetic about our contemporary moment and eternally relevant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)\n\nThis film turned D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and the late Bernie Mac into household names. Lee\u2019s swooping camera and clinical approach to the art of comedy centers the work that goes into the seeming effortlessness of the black expression of the art form.\n\n9. Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990)\n\nMy favorite of Lee\u2019s films uses the medium of jazz as a lens to meditate on the plight of black artists. Patriarchy and emotional abuse that are never fully critiqued keep Mo\u2019 Better Blues from being higher on the list, but the score and the performances of Joie Lee, Spike\u2019s sister, and Denzel elevate this otherwise small film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She\u2019s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nLee\u2019s first feature-length film is a French new-wave examination of the sexual double standards faced by black women filtered through Italian neorealism. His willingness to experiment with form, a major reason that his later films are not as successful, is how he made his name as a filmmaker. This film is now streaming on Netflix, and I am interested to see how the streaming service will update and expand upon the foundation Lee laid in its upcoming series.\n\n\n\n7. He Got Game (1998)\n\nLee knows basketball. A lifelong Knicks fan, he is known for his courtside antics cheering for a team that has not won a championship since Richard Nixon was in the White House. This film, both a love letter to the game and a searing indictment of the corruption that surrounds it, boasts a great Washington performance and a surprisingly competent one from Ray Allen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. 4 Little Girls (1996)\n\nHeartbreaking and raw, Lee\u2019s documentary about how the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., still haunts the family members of the four girls who died that day should have won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year. It let us know that Lee was not just a maker of fictional films and that he was a force to be reckoned with as a documentarian.\n\n\n\n5. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006)\n\nThis is Lee\u2019s magnum opus as a documentarian. It tells the story of Hurricane Katrina and shows how the U.S. government failed the people of the 9th Ward in every respect. It is required viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. School Daze (1988)\n\nBlack Greek organizations, magical realism, an HBCU football team that loses in embarrassing fashion during homecoming, Afrocentrism in tension with respectability politics, a song about colorism in the black community\u2014School Daze is everything.\n\n\n\n3. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nLee\u2019s most emotionally resonant film is an autobiographical story about a black family in the 1970s. For many it is their favorite, but the only reason it is not higher on my list is that the next two are so much more ambitious\u2014but depending on the day, this could easily find itself in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nMany consider this Lee\u2019s greatest film. It is a brilliant examination of black rage in the wake of the absurdity imposed by white supremacist police violence, a theme that still has resonance today. In fact, many were concerned that black folks would riot because of the climactic scenes. And yet this is a strikingly beautiful film. His frequent cinematographer Ernest Dickerson seizes every opportunity to use the lens to create striking images. This could be No. 1 if not for the sheer audacity of the film Lee made 25 years ago last week ...\n\n\n\n1. Malcolm X (1992)\n\nWhat can I add that has not already been written about this film? Washington should have won the Oscar. Lee should have won the Oscar. Angela Bassett should have won the Oscar. Whoever was the conk-hair consultant should have won an Oscar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee\u2019s depiction of the legendary historical figure was flawed because he used The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a foundation for the narrative, but that does not take away from the power of the film. He needed the help of Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent black folks to finish the film, and I\u2019m glad they came through financially. This is Lee\u2019s best film. The one he was born to make.\n\n\n\nHe is not a perfect filmmaker\u2014I\u2019m still lost for what I should think about Red Hook Summer\u2014but when he is on his game, he is among the best filmmakers in America.", "keywords": ["won", "film", "spike", "25", "malcolm", "lees", "work", "best", "movies", "films", "x", "ranked", "lee", "black"], "polarity": 0.1633188557005125, "subjectivity": 0.4983504414717432},

These instances are typically about female students (because let\u2019s face it, dress codes are pretty much only about women\u2019s fashion and beauty), and more often than not about students of color.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, we learned of black teen twins in Massachusetts who were banned from prom and extracurricular clubs for wearing braided hair extensions. A popular protective style for naturals, the braids were said to be against the school\u2019s rules against hair extensions, distracting hairstyles and hair higher than 2 inches.\n\n\n\nKnowing what we know about black hair growth\u2014that tightly coiled or kinky hair grows up and out instead of down, and that the use of extensions like box braids allows for healthy hair growth\u2014this rule sounded extremely targeted toward students of color, specifically black students. The school has since suspended all punishments and promised to rework the policies, but the larger concern is cultural education and addressing the biases that breed school policies targeting black students.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthor Obiagele Lake discusses the connection between black codes from the Reconstruction era and the mandated appearance codes that we see in the present day in her 2003 book, Blue Veins and Kinky Hair: Naming and Color Consciousness in African America. After the Civil War, Southern states passed black codes as a means of limiting newly freed African Americans and pushing free blacks to continue to work in labor-intensive industries.\n\n\n\nThe book touches on the internalized negative images carried through black generations created from involuntary lives in a white supremacist culture. Some of these codes were so specific that they targeted the types of patterns and clothes that black people were able to wear, citing them as an effort to help newly freed blacks \u201cfit in\u201d with their new environment. All the while, the codes continued to limit the freedom of identity and cultural expression that had been stifled through enslavement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe hear similar reasoning behind school dress code policies, that they are an effort to decrease obvious income disparities or differences that might distract others in a learning environment\u2014giving students a visual level playing field and contributing to school unity. But a 2014 study conducted by the National Women\u2019s Law Center (pdf) and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reported that black girls are fives times more likely to be suspended from school than their white female counterparts (only 17 percent of the school population, black girls make up 43 percent of those receiving disciplinary action). When we look at the targets of dress codes and bias toward mandating the appearance of girls, these numbers aren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\n\n\nSystematic discrimination is a major problem. But what about the long-term effects on our children? I spoke with Adrianne Pettiford, a published research psychologist who studies discrimination in schools as well as racial-identity development, particularly among black youths. When asked about the effects of being discriminated against or \u201cpicked on\u201d based on racial characteristics like hair or skin color, Pettiford explained that bullying of any nature may have many effects (e.g., anxiety, physical aggression, academic disengagement, low self-esteem, etc.). Yet \u201c[w]hen bullying is racially motivated, there are additional potential consequences\u2014the child may internalize the messages of their bullies and come to feel that being black is a negative characteristic,\u201d she said.\n\nPettiford noted that while she does not specifically study the connection between dress code violations and racial identity, she is definitely aware of the disparity in punishment of black children compared with their white counterparts. She commented that \u201cthis disparity fuels the academic disengagement of black female students and contributes to their contact with the juvenile justice system and subsequent adult offending. The school-to-prison pipeline often is discussed when speaking of black male youths, but it is also a reality for our girls.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Pettiford what advice she would give to parents wanting to advocate and address their children\u2019s feelings, since we have some understanding of how our children may be affected by punishment connected to their appearance. She suggested that \u201cparents be intentional about ensuring social media and popular media are not the only sources of racial messages their child receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith regard to racial socialization [the practice of teaching children about the meaning and personal implications of race], a combination of conveying both the positive aspects of being black and how to handle instances in which they encounter racial bias seems to work best,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, a parent might discuss with their teenager how to respond when told their natural hair is problematic before such an issue ever occurs, and help plan appropriate responses.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn popular culture, black natural hair is \u201con trend.\u201d Mainstream media has picked up on the perceived coolness of some types of black hair, and we see an increase in representation. However, for many black women, our hair has been anything but cool for the majority of our lives. Regardless of the celebration we may see now, there is a lifetime of hate and pain wrapped around our natural hair texture and the way we have been treated because of it.\n\n\n\nTo be told that your natural self (a \u201cself\u201d that many of us have spent the majority of our lives learning to love and accept) is a fad, is extreme or is exaggerated can be dehumanizing. Where is the code banning blond hair? We would be up in arms at someone\u2019s personal preference of acceptable beauty being made into a hard-and-fast rule for all women to follow.\n\nThis is what is being asked of black girls and women\u2014to take a cultural standard as rule and change ourselves to fit in. The Transportation Security Administration still pats down my hair every single time I travel\u2014all while I am watching white women with buns and updos walk through untouched. We are tired of being prohibited, especially while being told that it is to help us fit in or to avoid distracting others.

If you are reading this \u2014 or, if you're not reading this and just happen to be alive somewhere breathing air or eating Baja Fresh \u2014 Taye Diggs believes that you're a nincompoop. A fool. A fucking dunce. Because only an idiot would see a Black man and his lighter-skinned Black son, and then see the son's White mother, and have no fucking idea what was going on. Like you just saw a squirrel doing Crossfit. On the back of a Black unicorn.\n\nBut, apparently, this is one of his rationales for wanting his son to be considered biracial instead of Black.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my son to be in a situation where he calls himself Black and everyone thinks he has a Black mom and a Black dad, and then they see a white mother, they wonder, \u2018oh, what\u2019s going on?'\u201d\n\nAgain, if you are reading this, Taye Diggs believes you are the dumbest motherfucker who ever lived.\n\n2. Taye Diggs has two children's books. One, Mixed Me!, is based on his son. The other, Chocolate Me!, is based on his own experience. I actually own Chocolate Me!. It was one of the gifts The Wife Person and I received at our baby shower last month; an addition to our yet-to-be-born daughter's library. I haven't opened it yet, but I'm sure it's nice and empowering and shit.\n\nAnyway, that he would be compelled to write a book like this is not a surprise. He has made no secret of how he was teased as a kid for his looks and his complexion, and how much that hurt him. These claims may seem insincere \u2014 or, at the very least, melodramatic \u2014 because they're coming from someone roundly considered to be one of the handsomest men in Hollywood today, but it's not too difficult to imagine a short, dark, theater nerd named Scott getting teased for being a short, dark, theater nerd named Scott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis background provides a bit of a context for his history of making racially awkward statements. And, to be frank, I wouldn't be surprised if he says these racially awkward things because he still feels awkward racially about himself. While I have no doubt he's very much aware that he is Black, I wonder if he considers his Blackness \u2014 and Blackness in general \u2014 to be a positive thing.\n\nOf course, he would not be the only Black person to own this idea. It's one of the many unfortunate byproducts of America's historically antagonistic relationship with its Black citizens. It is beyond sad, and I do harbor a level of sympathy for people who feel this way. But whatever sympathy I possess is canceled out and surpassed by my want to keep that idea \u2014 that \"Blackness\" inherently equals \"badness\" \u2014 from spreading even more. My joy in finding it, and squashing it like a stinkbug on a windowsill, is palpable.\n\nBecause, when it manifests as a Black man (or woman) teaching his (or her) Black son (or daughter) that they are not Black, that they will not be seen as and treated like a Black person, they are now actively jeopardizing that child's life. The difference between a Black child being aware of and embracing of his Blackness \u2014 and everything that means \u2014 and being taught that he or she is not Black could literally be the difference between that child dying at 16 or dying at 86.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, I'm sorry Taye, but you gotta catch it for that bullshit today.", "keywords": ["doesnt", "diggs", "person", "reading", "taye", "idea", "believes", "racially", "son", "blackness", "dont", "black"], "polarity": -0.04639026988636361, "subjectivity": 0.545770991161616},

I didn't \u2014 and still don't \u2014 believe Spike had to end this epic and panoramic classic with a saccharine 90-second afterschool special. But it is also (arguably) its most effective. Because of the obvious emotional resonance of having a group of Black boys and girls say those words aloud on film. And also because it makes sense on both a macro (Malcolm X's legacy lives on) and a micro sense. Malcolm X wasn't just an everyman. He was literally every man. A poor kid, a pimp, a thief, a transplant, a porter, a prisoner, a bartender, a numbers runner, a preacher, a prophet; it was like he packed 12 different lives into 39 years of life.

I'm certain some of these people do in fact realize that what they believe and what Dr. King believed are at two separate ends of the spectrum. Connecting themselves to him is just a transparently counterfeit way to pander politically and give themselves an \"I'm not racist\" alibi.

Wigdor and Jeanne Christensen of the Wigdor law firm, who are representing the two women, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit named Slater, Fox News and parent company 21st Century Fox as defendants. It also alleged that Slater\u2019s superiors did little to address the alleged behavior, which created a hostile work environment with \u201csevere and pervasive discrimination and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe women have also allegedly faced retaliation, with Wright, who had spoken out against Slater\u2019s action, being transferred out of the payroll department on Monday. According to the Times, the lawsuit slammed the move as a demotion, while the company said it was a lateral move.\n\nBrown, the lawsuit claims, was fired Monday; however, the company insisted on Tuesday night that she was still employed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit acknowledged that both women declined a settlement offer from Fox, and it named four other black employees who either left the company or were forced out, citing similar allegations.\n\nFor its part, Fox says that it took action immediately after learning about the allegations against Slater, which culminated in her being fired on Feb. 28.\n\n\u201cWe take complaints of this nature very seriously and took prompt and effective remedial action before Ms. Brown and Ms. Wright sued in court and even before Ms. Wright complained through her lawyer,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThere is no place for inappropriate verbal remarks like this at Fox News.

Well, he looks like a Benetton model, which helps. But more importantly, he's been very outspoken, passionate, and articulate in his support of the uprising in Ferguson. And, as we all know, a man with model good looks + social consciousness is to a Bougie Black Girl what cocaine + the shit you use to turn cocaine into crack is to a crackhead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, Williams seems set to hold the crown for 2014. But what about last year? And 10 years ago? Who were the crownholders then? Curious, I dispatched a one person research team (Me) to get to the bottom of this, giving myself complete leeway to make completely arbitrary decisions about this, going back to 1994. (Why 1994? Because 1994 was a great year, and no one reading this gives a shit about what happened before then.)\n\nBefore we begin, let's establish a couple rules.\n\n1. The celebrity crushes have to be specific to Bougie Black Girls. For instance, you won't find people like Idris Elba, Denzel Washington, or Justin Slayer on the list because they seem to appeal to all women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.

Sadly, he also convinced an entire generation of young Black boys that hot Bougie Black Girls loved guys who loved math. Which explains why the male/female ratio at every NSBE convention is 2634 to 1.\n\n1997-1998; Larenz Tate\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Love Jones is an iconic movie, I think it's better if we all collectively forget Darius Lovehall was an unemployed stalker who'd totally catch a street harassment charge today.\n\n1999-2000: Taye Diggs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith his turn in The Best Man, Diggs seemed poised to hold the celebrity crush crown for years to come. Unfortunately for Diggs, a requirement of holding the Bougie Black Girl celebrity crush crown is that you actually need to like Black women.\n\n2001-2004: Mos Def\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brooklyn born rapper, who narrowly beat out strong contenders Common and Andre 3000 for the crown in each of these years, became such a ubiquitous figure in Bougie Black culture that local Mos Def doppelgangers \u2014 the usually dreadlocked deep brothers at every poetry slam who used words like \"aura\" and \"essence\" in regular conversation \u2014 also experienced a popularity boon.

We don\u2019t know how long he would have lived had he not been assassinated 50 years ago on Feb. 21, 1965, on the stage of the Audubon Ballroom at Broadway and West 165th Street in New York City. We just know that he was taken from us far too soon. Still, his intense, bespectacled gaze, forefinger resting against his face, remains the prevailing emblem of black rage and resistance. That his legacy has reverberated for decades without the stamp of approval from the U.S. government, without being taught in schools or quoted in Christian churches on Sunday mornings, speaks to the sheer magnitude of the man and the undeniable truth in his message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalcolm didn\u2019t tiptoe around diagnosing the illness of white supremacy or pointing out its symptoms in the form of religious terrorism and police brutality. He boldly declared that systemic racism is not baseless conjecture; rather, it is a deeply embedded statement of fact that provides the framework for the United States of America.\n\nMalcolm X loved black people and hated structural whiteness. Today, as dead black bodies continue to fall in U.S. streets from Ohio to New York, a booming prison-industrial complex continues to scour street corners for prey and a corrupt political system continues to placate black citizens with a blurry carbon copy of equality, his words in a 1964 letter to the Egyptian Gazette still ring true:\n\nWe can never get civil rights in America until our human rights are first restored. We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as humans. \u2026 The American \u201csystem\u201d (political, economic and social) was produced from the enslavement of the black man, and this present \u201csystem\u201d is capable only of perpetuating that enslavement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is often said that revolution is for the young; this was true of Malcolm. Though he looms larger than life, he was 27 years old when he began preaching at Muhammad\u2019s Temple No. 7 in Harlem and only 39 years old when at least seven bullets left him gasping for his final breaths mere moments after greeting a crowd with \u201cAs-Salaam-Alaikum.\u201d\n\nPeace be unto you.\n\nAnd when he said peace, he also meant freedom because he taught us that there is no way to be at peace without it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his riveting and iconic eulogy, activist and actor Ossie Davis declared Malcolm to be our \u201cshining black prince.\u201d What is less often quoted is that Davis also said that Harlem\u2019s black community\u2014\u201cbeleaguered, unfortunate, but nonetheless proud\u201d\u2014had never had a \u201cbraver, more gallant, young champion\u201d than Malcolm X. And it is that same bravery that propels a movement from city to city today.\n\nMany of us know the myth and the legend of Malcolm X. Here, The Root takes a look at the young man in action, putting on for his city and for his people, in these rarely seen clips.\n\n1. Malcolm X \u201cCity Desk\u201d interview, March 17, 1963:\n\nHere\u2019s Malcolm X on slavery stealing black identity as well as the enrollment of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi: \u201cIt\u2019s a farce; it\u2019s hypocrisy. Because if it\u2019s right for one Negro to be forced into that university then every Negro in the state of Mississippi who is qualified has the same right to go to that university. And if the government is not ready and willing to enforce the right of every Negro in the state of Mississippi, then it\u2019s only hypocrisy to pretend they are for justice by pushing one Negro in and blowing it up all over the world to make it look like they\u2019re solving the problem when millions of black people in that state are going to segregated schools and getting an inferior education.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Malcolm X during an undated ABC interview on the importance of being black:\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018Negro\u2019 is a term that was made up by the white man himself during slavery. No right-thinking black man in America will accept it as a term to apply to himself. If the white man, no matter how dark he gets, still regards himself as a white man, then our people, no matter how light we get, still regard ourselves as black people. If it\u2019s good enough for them to be white, then it\u2019s better for us to be black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Malcolm X speaks in Los Angeles on May 5, 1962, at the memorial service for Ronald Stokes, an NOI member killed by the Los Angeles Police Department:\n\n\u201c[Black people] should shock the white man by working together in unity. Despite religious, political, economic, or educational or social differences. Let us remember that we\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Baptist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Methodist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Muslims. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Catholic. We\u2019re brutalized because we\u2019re black people in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis speech is also when Malcolm asked the powerful, rhetorical question: \u201cWho taught you to hate yourself?\u201d\n\n4. Malcolm X debates civil rights leader and March on Washington architect Bayard Rustin on the need for self-determination for black America:\n\n\u201cToday the black man, according to the government economist, has spending power of $20 billion per year. We feel that with the black man spending $20 billion per year, not creating any businesses, not creating any industry, not creating any job opportunities for his own kind, he\u2019s not in a moral position to point the finger at the white man and say that he\u2019s discriminating against him for not giving him a job in factories that he himself set up. If the black man has $20 billion and these so-called Negroes are such geniuses that they can integrate white restaurants and white factories and force themselves into that which the white man has set up, they should use that same ingenuity to show the black people how to pool our wealth and set up something of our own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to Rustin\u2019s criticism of the NOI for organizing in the streets of Harlem, Malcolm responded, \u201cYou can reach more people in the street who want to change than you can in the bourgeoisie society, the bourgeoisie church and the bourgeoisie circles.\u201d\n\n5. Malcolm X on voting:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest that they vote for any party or either party. I would suggest that the so-called Negroes become politically mature, realize the power that they hold in the field of politics. Once the person realizes that the Negro is awakened to the power that he holds, then that person will approach that Negro on a more intelligent plane.

But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I asked four friends, who usually love going to the movies, to go to the Justice League screening and the collective answers were \u201cI\u2019ve got Bible study,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m mentoring\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d until finally someone said, \u201cI guess, since the theater\u2019s near my house.\u201d\n\nWhen we got there, a young black woman who worked for the promotions company was taking the tickets when I heard someone loudly playing Vince Staples\u2019 \u201cBagBak,\u201d the song from the second Black Panther trailer. The woman was literally watching the Black Panther trailer on her phone while collecting tickets to see Justice League. If that\u2019s not some passive-aggressive \u201cThis movie is trash and I\u2019m just here till February so I don\u2019t get fined\u201d Black Girl Magic, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nTurns out the signs were right: Justice League is terrible, the action sequences are bad, the cast has no chemistry and it\u2019s a CGI nightmare in most parts. I know you\u2019re going to see it anyway, but here\u2019s what you\u2019re setting yourself up for.\n\n\n\nThe plot of Justice League is perfectly serviceable: Batman (Ben Affleck) forms a team of heroes he\u2019s been hinting at for three movies to stop an alien invasion. The problem is with everything else. We\u2019re now five movies into the DC Comics universe (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Wonder Woman), and none of these films have a firm handle on who these characters really are. When you bring them all together, it\u2019s like awkward speed dating more than team building.\n\nIs Cyborg (he and his dad are apparently the only speaking black people in the DC Universe) a brooding internet Frankenstein or is he the \u201cbooyah\u201d-loving kid from Teen Titans Go? Is Ezra Miller\u2019s Flash the anxious kid haunted by his dad\u2019s imprisonment or is he the quirky Ross-from-Friends, Jesse Eisenberg-in-every-movie trope, forcing \u201ccomedy relief\u201d down our throats? And Bat-fleck? The guy who is supposedly obsessed with bringing the team together but has given every indication that he wants out of the franchise? I\u2019m not saying he phoned in his performance, but his effort was about as consistent as T-Mobile on the subway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs little as the characters are actually together in movie time (maybe two days tops), it\u2019s hard to see any camaraderie. Mind you, this is a superhero movie, not Moonlight\u2014as long as the action is good and it\u2019s visually appealing, it should be salvageable, right? Unfortunately, the action scenes and character designs are lousy, too, and suffer from a serious case of doing too much.\n\nThe problem starts with Flash (who is never actually called that name in the movie) and permeates the entire film. Between Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past and Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Hollywood has produced some really fascinating effects for showing superspeedsters. Justice League muddles everything about the Flash by only showing his powers in slow motion and constantly circling him in electricity, and he seldom interacts with anything that\u2019s not CGI.\n\nIn Justice League\u2019s first battle as a \u201cteam,\u201d there is a tepid attempt to re-create parts of the incredible shootout scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past (right up to running along the walls). However, in Justice League, someone decided that it\u2019s more fun to blur the entire background, slow everything down and make it almost impossible to contrast Flash\u2019s speed with the world around him. You should never be watching an action sequence with the Flash and think to yourself, \u201cWill he just hurry up?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of giving Cyborg (Ray Fisher) a RoboCop physique that is a mixture of flesh and machine, Justice League designs him like a first-generation Cylon from Battlestar Galactica, complete with a lack of genitals or flesh (which adds some interesting racial subtext to the furtive glances between Cyborg and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). (Have to make sure the tin black man with the genius IQ and the athletic background will never have sex!)\n\nDespite being crucial to the plot, Cyborg is the only Justice Leaguer who can\u2019t consistently control his powers, and when he does, it looks clunky. Two of the three big fight scenes in Justice League occur in dark places or with a rusted red-and-orange background, which gives the film\u2019s big set pieces a lack of depth and a drab feeling. You\u2019ll see the contrast in these poor cinematic choices at work in Batman\u2019s dark and confusing opening fight with a CGI Parademon, compared with Wonder Woman\u2019s amazing takedown of some actual real-life bank robbers. (Wonder Woman\u2019s opening is the second-best action sequence in any DC movie behind Man of Steel\u2019s superhuman fight in Smallville.)\n\nFinally, maybe somebody at Warner Bros. has stock in black pixel footage, or maybe somebody in production has a weird obsession with hentai, but this is the third DC movie (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad and now Justice League) in which some large black tentacle thing has to be defeated in order to save the world. It\u2019s getting kind of weird.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas there anything to like about Justice League? A little. There is a semibig surprise near the middle of the movie with a really fun action scene and fight that hasn\u2019t been spoiled by trailers. The whole setup could\u2019ve been a game changer had it lasted longer and the chemistry between characters been better. Aquaman doing his best Khal Drogo/Wolverine impression by running around shirtless seemed to impress a few people in the audience.\n\nThere were a few witty lines of dialogue, but you\u2019ve seen most of the punchlines in the trailers, so they weren\u2019t as funny in the movie. The movie sets up the Flash and Aquaman for their own films (but not Cyborg), so if the movie is a huge success, those spinoff films will be coming for fans. There are a few references to other DC superheroes that may appear down the line if the movie is successful enough. Honestly, though, the way Justice League ends, there isn\u2019t any real indication as to why this group would need to team up again except for another cash grab, no matter what the two post-credit scenes try to hint at.\n\nIf you have to see something before Thanksgiving weekend, I suspect you could drag yourself to see this movie, but I would recommend Justice League for \u201cRedbox and chill.\u201d That way you won\u2019t be mad about the $2 you spent.", "keywords": ["movie", "action", "wonder", "desperate", "dc", "trash", "money", "flash", "youre", "cyborg", "league", "going", "justice", "grab", "team", "black"], "polarity": 0.04552579365079365, "subjectivity": 0.4982953042328042},

Probably because most of Angela Robinson\u2019s career has largely been in the shadows of television, directing and producing such hit series as The L Word, True Blood, Hung and How to Get Away With Murder, even though she did write and direct the 2004 feature film D.E.B.S., co-starring Meagan Good.\n\n\n\nComing on the heels of the multimillion-dollar global box-office phenomenon Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins this summer, Professor Marston and the Wonder Women has the potential to lift Robinson out of those shadows. At the very least, it uncovers one of the most interesting backstories in superhero history.\n\nAs it is for many women, Robinson\u2019s interest in Wonder Woman began as a little girl, but she didn\u2019t become aware of creator William Moulton Marston until many years later when one of the actors in her first feature film gave her a book on Wonder Woman and she found the chapter on the Marstons.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe the story,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just an incredible story.\u201d\n\nThe story prompted Robinson to spend eight years on the film, writing it for four and then trying to get it made for another four. In fact, when she shot the film last fall, Robinson had no idea if it would even get a theatrical release. But she never lost faith in the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarston\u2014an early innovator of the lie-detector test, which inspired Wonder Woman\u2019s truth-seeking lasso\u2014developed and taught his \u201cDISC theory,\u201d focusing on dominance, inducement, submission and compliance. It was his belief that women were the superior sex and should and would rule the world.\n\nBy some accounts, he predicted 2037 as the year of reckoning. His high esteem for women was manifested through his wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, who was one of just three women to graduate from Boston University School of Law in 1918.\n\nLater, when the Marstons entered into a relationship with Olive Byrne, a former student who became a research assistant to him and his wife, William Marston reportedly felt that the combination of Elizabeth and Olive created the perfect woman and they, along with his DISC theory, became the main spark behind Wonder Woman, a comic he penned under the name Charles Moulton, which appeared in 1941.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were out of this early psychology, which really thought that you could change the world with your ideas,\u201d Robinson explains. \u201cSo Wonder Woman is the only superhero that was created with the premise of stopping war. That was her purpose.\u201d\n\nThe polyamorous relationship depicted in the film among William; his wife, Elizabeth; and Byrne\u2014who is, coincidentally, the niece of birth control champion Margaret Sanger\u2014is probably one of the aspects of the film that casual Wonder Woman fans may find the most shocking, especially given the times. For that reason, it\u2019s the aspect Robinson treated with the most care.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want it to be exploitative or gratuitous,\u201d she says of depicting the sexual and emotional relationship among the three. \u201cSince the subject matter could be so potentially controversial, I kind of made a decision early on to direct it just so I could try to tell an organic love story, not to make a huge deal about what they were doing [sexually].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Last week, during a panel at New York Comic Con, Robinson defended her depiction of the characters\u2019 sexuality after a few attendees raised questions about whether Elizabeth and Byrne were actually sexually involved, and that William Marston\u2019s relationship with the two women was actually polygamous. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of facts that are indisputable about the Marstons, and I feel like there\u2019s a lot of room for interpretation,\u201d Robinson said during the panel.)\n\nRobinson made the relationship among the three very simple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a love story between three people instead of a love story between two people, so I just directed it the way I would approach any kind of romance or any biopic,\u201d she says. \u201cI think a lot of times people portray polyamory or BDSM [bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism] in a way that\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re so crazy, they\u2019re so kinky,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t want to do it like that. I just kind of wanted to be really respectful and treat it like I would treat anything else.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, Robinson says, such relationships aren\u2019t exactly new ones. Instead, we are deluded into thinking they are. \u201cPeople tend to look back on history and think nobody ever had sex and nobody ever did anything,\u201d she notes.\n\n\u201cI think people were a lot more liberated,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s always been these kinds of unconventional relationships. It\u2019s just that they\u2019ve been erased from history.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what shines through most in Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is their idealism and courage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were trying to save the world with their ideas through pop culture,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHe was just like, \u2018That\u2019s going to reach way more people than my academic books. So I\u2019m going to make a superhero, but I\u2019m going to put my ideas into this superhero.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd, decades later, Robinson, like many other young girls familiar with the comic book and/or the 1970s TV series starring Lynda Carter, is proof positive of Marston\u2019s theory.\n\n\u201cSeeing Wonder Woman when I was a kid definitely helped me,\u201d says Robinson, who also adores the first-ever, big-screen version of Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot. \u201cShe was the only girl around, and that made me feel empowered. She still makes me feel empowered.

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based on its being not only the sole place on Earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, it is centuries ahead of anywhere else on the planet. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear that he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this with Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on Earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther\u201d). Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by way of New York City.

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

Gallach cited \"flesh and blood ambassadors\" Gra\u00e7a Machel of Mozambique, Alaa Murabit of Libya, Le\u00ffcmah Gbowee of Liberia and Queen Mathilde of Belgium for their commitment to fighting gender inequality, as well as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson and Messenger of Peace Charlize Theron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo comment on Theron or Watson. But Machel, a radical African freedom fighter, former first lady of two African nations and a woman who just announced the Pan African Women in Media Network, a group of African female journalists, would be excellent as a U.N. role model.\n\nAnother almost-forgotten current black female world leader is Michele Montas, the former radio broadcast fighter for Haiti\u2019s freedom with her husband, the martyred hero Jean Dominique. Montas was once a top U.N. secretary-general spokeswoman, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\n(Note: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama has shown some interest in the topic of girls\u2019 education. We\u2019ll see what she does as she moves along.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFantasy and reality collide a little uneasily here. Wonder Woman\u2014who, ironically, in the comics has been a U.N. ambassador representing Themyscira (the former Paradise Island)\u2014is really not the issue; although, as an impossibly proportioned stand-in for the beauty and power of European women, she clearly could be.\n\nBut look, I\u2019m the last one to lead an anti-superhero bag. Anyone who knows me well, or at least has read my blog\u2014which might be the same thing in today\u2019s culture\u2014knows that I have been absolutely wild for Marvel and DC superheroes my entire life. (Back in the \u201970s, even that newfangled film called Star Wars couldn\u2019t dent the childhood love I had for my mag characters.)\n\nI\u2019ve owned thousands of superhero comics, scores of action figures and hundreds of hours of superhero, animated product. I\u2019m first in line for the Thursday-night screening of any Marvel film. A few years ago, I used to joke that I was the only Pan-Africanist I knew who owned a life-size Captain America shield. (At one point, I actually owned two\u2014one for the office, one for home.) So I get the temptation of the United Nations to make a publicity-soaked, social-content splash using the fantasy versions of ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut superheroes, ultimately, are 20th-century, American mass media creations that emerged from the internal constructs of the collective unconscious. As folktale characters, the stories they star in force us to find our own powers from within. But as much as we may love their exciting, symbolic stories, they are not literal representations of our power. And we can\u2019t block out the idea that superheroes are also white-created commercial products of white conglomerates.\n\nFor almost 80 years, these characters have been extremely seductive advertisements for magazines, toys, trade paperbacks, animation, television programs and movies. They are among the most acceptable and accessible symbols of American capitalism, loved by those 8 to 80. So I actually found myself against the idea of a Captain America statue being unveiled in Brooklyn, N.Y., to celebrate his 75th anniversary earlier this year.\n\nBut black women and women of color, whose heroes emerge from history and blood, don\u2019t need to list fantasy characters. Young girls of any kind can look up to Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousufzai. Or activist Bree Newsome. Or radical legends Angela Davis, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\u2019s Diane Nash, our ancestor Fannie Lou Hamer and a score of black female leaders of the Black Panther Party, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding in Oakland, Calif., this past weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo strong shade thrown here on the Amazon princess; Wonder Woman has always been fun to see and read. Hell, Lynda Carter, TV\u2019s Wonder Woman of the 1970s, made her series debut as president of the United States Monday night on the CW\u2019s Supergirl! But she\u2019s not needed in the real world of the 2016 United Nations, which is trying to showcase a very real, protracted battle around the world for girls\u2019 education. And she definitely doesn\u2019t need honors, honorary or not, that could go to any of the thousands of women of color fighting around the world for women and girls.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

A Madea Halloween grossed more than $28 million opening weekend, I stumbled upon an unfortunate lil\u2019 meme that compared that gross with the one earned by Nate Parker\u2019s The Birth of a Nation. There, Tyler Perry was referred to as \u201cTyler Fairy,\u201d and regarding why the Madea movie made more money, well, \u201cBecause we will support emasculation over our quest for liberation.\u201d\n\nOf course, that was typed in all caps because if there\u2019s one thing a homophobic fool loves more than being wrong, it\u2019s being wrong with a caps lock. As poorly made and thought out as the meme was, it was a visual representation of many thoughts flooding social media and, depending on the media outlet, headlines. Some of us just love us a good conspiracy even if makes absolutely no sense.\n\nComedies tend to perform better than historical dramas. Tyler Perry isn\u2019t some unknown entity; he has created an empire spanning varying facets of the entertainment industry thanks to a very sizable, loyal fan base. Most of that fan base consists of black women\u2014the same demo that majorly supported Nate Parker\u2019s movie.\n\nWith respect to the notion about supporting a film directed by a black man but released by a major Hollywood studio, uh, black people\u2019s liberation will not come by way of consumerism, let alone a movie. Imagery matters, but one would have to be an empty-headed sucker to believe that a film could dismantle systemic racism and white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kind of fool who makes homophobic, meaningless memes, I suppose.\n\nAs for the \u201cemasculation of the black man\u201d trope, that does remind one of previous statements made by Parker himself. That\u2019s why I take great pleasure in Moonlight, which explores manhood and gay black identity, as the critical darling many anticipated The Birth of a Nation to be. Both the Madea movie and Moonlight are enjoying success in their respective circuits.\n\nStill, for all of Perry\u2019s success over time, he recently revealed, \"I still have issues getting screens in white neighborhoods, believe it or not.\u201d He went on to add about his opening figures: \"I think the numbers could have been bigger had people who are in the white suburbs had the option to go to their own theaters to see it. It's something I've been dealing with for many, many years.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were also tweets like this one sent out by the Washington Post: \u201cMoonlight is about a poor, black, gay teen. But here\u2019s why it relates to everyone.\u201d\n\nMovies with predominantly white casts never, ever have their stories presented this way.\n\nBlack people, no matter their gender, sexuality or amount of duct tape used to play a woman in a comedy, still have to contend with prejudice on varying levels. Each of us continues to be limited in some way by other people\u2019s biased perceptions of who we are and what we\u2019re capable of. We all have our values judged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor months now, there\u2019s been this ongoing question about why we as black people need to support one movie over all others. It\u2019s always been a crock; only the inherent biases are grating to the nerve. In sum, your counterfeit-Confucius, dimwitted cousins that refuse to let go of The Birth of a Nation\u2019s perceived failure need to find the nearest tar pit and hop headfirst into it.\n\nThere will be other films where people run this same logic, but, ultimately, one thing will remain constant: If you don\u2019t celebrate all of us, and if you opt to pit us against one another, you\u2019re a divisive fool. That and you never really loved us no way.

Not in the sense that you\u2019ve seen anything like it before (trust me, you haven\u2019t), but rather that seeing it feels like coming home.\n\n\n\nFor all of its technological wonders and visual delights, Black Panther is, in its deepest heart of hearts, the type of family drama that nearly everyone can relate to in one way or another. Before diving into the present-day status quo established in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther opens with a promise and a betrayal\u2014fraternal twins of fate whose very existences immediately give the movie\u2019s plot a Shakespearean sense of grandeur and intimacy.\n\nThe promise is of Wakanda itself\u2014symbolized in a brief, but powerful flashback to a younger T\u2019Chaka (played in his prime by Atandwa Kani, whose father, John Kani, portrays the older T\u2019Chaka both here and in Civil War) checking in on a covert intelligence mission in the United States. The betrayal is what T\u2019Chaka finds, a revelation that both changes the course of Wakanda\u2019s future and gets at the heart of one of the more difficult ideas Black Panther repeatedly asks: If Wakanda is the mighty beacon of excellence it claims to be, why hasn\u2019t it done more to help the world?\n\nThe question rises to the surface of the Royal Family\u2019s minds once again after an encounter with Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) inadvertently draws CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) into the Wakandans\u2019 midst. The country\u2019s culture of secrecy and isolationism is an important and fascinating part of its larger mythos, but it\u2019s one that Black Panther purposefully inspects and challenges through the various drives and goals of its characters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs its newly crowned King, T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is deeply vested in hewing to tradition, as his mother and father taught him. But a certain degree of uncertainty about how to embody a king\u2019s identity gives him the opportunity for some flexibility in his approach to shaping Wakanda\u2019s relationship to the world. Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a spy who frequently travels beyond Wakanda\u2019s borders and has seen the strife and poverty in the wider world, is adamant that Wakanda could become a larger force for global good. Describing Okoye (Danai Gurira) as simply the general of the Dora Milaje isn\u2019t entirely accurate; she is in almost every sense of the title, Hand to the King, second only to his mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett). Together, they represent a strong bloc in favor of Wakandan traditionalism\u2014a bloc that would be completely unified were it not for Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), T\u2019Challa\u2019s genius, teenaged sister who\u2019s more interested in her scientific research at the Wakandan Design Group than family politics.\n\nThough the Royal Family and those closest to them are not always in agreement with one another, there\u2019s a balance to their nuclear unit which strengthens the Wakandan throne. The stability of the Royal Family ensures the trust and allegiance of the other Wakandan tribes\u2014like the Jabari, a group of anti-technological people who live in the mountainous northern region of the country, where they\u2019re led by M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke). Each of the Wakandan tribes is a distinct cultural presence led by different figureheads who all have their own political agendas.\n\nWakanda\u2019s inner workings are intricate and at times strained, but the status quo of remaining isolated works specifically because the Wakandans put their own survival first. Given the specter of colonialism on the African continent, that\u2019s understandable. However, the promise of Wakanda introduced during the film\u2019s opening is, in a striking and beautiful way, the audience\u2019s entryway into seeing how someone from the outside might grow to resent the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Black Panther is actually one of the more grounded and human Marvel films, Erik Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) villainous motivation is immediately understandable and completely relatable. If you knew what he knew, you\u2019d want to fight T\u2019Challa, too. Even in the moments where Killmonger\u2019s ambition to take the Wakandan throne boil over into overt bloodthirstiness, there\u2019s a voice in the back of your head reminding you what brought him to that point, and why maybe he has a point.\n\nIn a very literal way, Killmonger is the embodiment of the pain and anguish that comes along with being a black American who is unable to trace their familial roots back more than a few generations. Those gaps in ancestral knowledge are the direct result of families being murdered and wiped from the historical record, never to be fully known or remembered by their descendants. Killmonger\u2019s trauma is something that T\u2019Challa can\u2019t fully grasp, given the nature of his own upbringing. The two become diametrically opposed to one another, despite the fact that they are both fundamentally fighting for the betterment of their shared people.\n\nOf all the players in T\u2019Challa\u2019s orbit, Killmonger is the most extreme in his beliefs that Wakanda should be both open and expansionist. His vision is the all-too-understandable conclusion that dawns on every single black person once we consider everything an open Wakanda could be and mean, not just for the world, but specifically for the African diaspora. Black Panther asks the kinds of questions about Wakanda that aren\u2019t fun to think about, but are important all the same. How might the course of history been changed had the country not been closed off? What might global blackness look and feel like in a world like that? The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a world in which those questions can be asked in earnest and the Wakandan people have to grapple with the possible answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn\u2019t contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda\u2019s magnificence. Though Wakanda is an Afrofuturist wonderland, it\u2019s still meant to be an actual place on Earth and it feels like it. Director Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison craft breathtaking, on-the-ground shots that give Wakanda\u2019s streets a texture and vibrancy that blends old-world hustle and bustle with gleaming accents of the future.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also pleasantly surprising how funny Black Panther is. While the movie\u2019s tone never dips too, too deep into abject misery, there are enough moments of solemnity that when a joke about T\u2019Challa\u2019s dad sandals pops up, you\u2019re not really prepared to laugh quite that hard. Though the movie\u2019s comedic moments land squarely, they\u2019re also subtle, often bubbling up suddenly\u2014almost as if willed into existence by the chemistry between the cast. There\u2019s a palpable love between T\u2019Challa, Ramonda, Shuri, and Okoye that propels them forward as a unit; at the same time, there\u2019s a complicated understanding between them all and Killmonger that keeps the plot compelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s action builds effortless, upward momentum that immediately reminds you that you\u2019re still in a humongous Marvel movie. Thankfully, there\u2019s no big, glowing, CGI deus ex machina waiting as Black Panther\u2019s ultimate big bad, but the film\u2019s penultimate major battle is chock full of just enough explosions to scratch your itch if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to say about Black Panther because, like Wakanda, it\u2019s an embarrassment of riches that you can\u2019t really hope to fully unpack in one sitting. It\u2019s the kind of Marvel movie that definitely benefits from more than a single viewing, and it\u2019s one that\u2019ll draw you in\u2014and blow your mind every single time.", "keywords": ["panther", "theres", "family", "marvels", "epic", "world", "shakespearean", "wakandas", "wakandan", "tchalla", "marvel", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.12236610288935874, "subjectivity": 0.46050496660961776},

Much of the hype had nothing to do with the storyline or the fact that the Marvel Universe had finally been integrated. There was one aspect of the film that intrigued us more than anything else:\n\nWe wanted to see Wakanda.\n\nThe idea of an African utopia is not new. We had created versions of it before. We are sometimes fooled into believing in a romanticized version of Kemet where pharaohs were not slave-owning monarchs. We imagine a welcoming Motherland waiting for us with unlimited resources and open arms. We wonder what a present-day mother continent would look like if it hadn\u2019t been sullied by colonizers and empire builders. With Black Panther, we would get to see it in 3-D with surround sound.\n\nBefore I even saw Black Panther, I had already decided to engage in a weeklong experiment of becoming a black conservative as part of The Root\u2019s I Tried It series. For the last four days and counting, I have limited my news consumption to Fox News, Breitbart and other right-wing media outlets that I normally laugh at for their predictably unfair and mentally unbalanced news slant.\n\nThose polar opposites were separate and unconnected in my mind until last night. While watching the Fox News evening lineup and listening to the rationalization for the rise in gun violence, praise for the Trump administration, the vilification of immigrants and non-Christians, and\u2014most important\u2014the overwhelming belief in a past and future idyllic \u201cgreat\u201d nation, I realized something:\n\nAmerica is Wakanda for white people.\n\nSince Donald Trump descended down that slow-moving escalator with a stern, lipless scowl, surrounded by his orange-skinned family members of various shades, we have been inundated with the phrase \u201cMake America great again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe overwhelmingly accepted idea of American exceptionalism is an unquenchable fantasy that lives in the Caucasian consciousness in the same way that the African paradise occupies the hearts and minds of the descendants of this country\u2019s stolen human chattel.\n\nIt is not real.\n\nBlack people already know this. We understand that America\u2019s status as an international economic superpower was earned with the blood and sweat that irrigated the cotton fields of the concentration camps we euphemize as \u201cplantations.\u201d On the eve of the Civil War (not the one fought by Captain America\u2014the other one), cotton was 60 percent of America\u2019s exports, and 80 percent of cotton was produced in slave-owning states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the reason that the U.S., like the fictional Wakanda, had unimaginable wealth. We had an unlimited supply of the valuable resource of free labor. Steven Deyle explained the value of slavery this way in his book Carry Me Back: The Domestic Slave Trade in American Life:\n\nIt was also equal to about seven times the total value of all currency in circulation in the country, three times the value of the entire livestock population, twelve times the value of the entire U.S. cotton crop and forty-eight times the total expenditure of the federal government that year.\n\nYet the Confederate-flag-waving traditionalists who revere their Southern heritage while touting the legacy of freedom and liberty that \u201cmake America great\u201d willingly overlook this inescapable fact. They forget that there is only one reason America was ever considered great in the first place:\n\nSlavery was America\u2019s vibranium.\n\nThe idealized memory of a bygone era of Christian values and moral righteousness also conveniently deletes the evil immorality of the 4,743 lynchings from 1882 to 1968. Their America is an Atlantis-like land that didn\u2019t slaughter the indigenous, steal their land, herd them like cattle and commit a genocide that wiped out entire nations of Native Americans. In their delusion, their forefathers were geniuses who didn\u2019t bomb churches with little girls inside, spit on children trying to attend integrated schools, bust skulls on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, or bash the brains of peaceful men and women who wanted to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven now, they are trying to re-create their own Wakanda.\n\nThey believe that their country can only be saved with a border wall and a travel ban, even though net immigration is less than zero, and immigrants are more hardworking and peaceful than American citizens.\n\nThey paint the descendants of the same people who built their Wakanda for free as lazy, violent and seeking handouts. They believe that the reason for their economic demise is outsiders who discovered their secret location and are crossing the border to steal jobs in the vibranium mines and heart-shaped flower fields.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd worst of all, they voted for Killmonger.\n\nThey were not satisfied with the previous king, so they voted for the one who threw his challengers off a cliff. Even when they found out that he mistreated their women, they didn\u2019t care. They\u2019re cool with his hate and equivocation of \u201cboth sides.\u201d No one understands why they support the war hawk with the weird haircut, but they do.\n\nIs this your king?\n\nBlack America understands that Wakanda is not real. We can appreciate the fairy tale, but if we believed for a second that the illusion was real, we would all be collectively packing our bags and booking one-way flights to T\u2019Chaka International Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut half of America is on a mission to re-create a fantasyland that never was. They dream of an all-white world devoid of Muslims, melanin and anyone who dares to kneel while their national lullaby plays softly in their ears. Their version of vibranium is the unlimited wealth that white privilege affords, black lives are their national enemy, and their Dora Milaje is made of gun-toting social studies teachers and cops who shoot black people in the face. They are desperately trying to make it a reality because their American dream has always been a mirage.\n\nIt\u2019s Wakanda for white people.", "keywords": ["white", "value", "america", "cotton", "great", "unlimited", "times", "american", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.016409068362193368, "subjectivity": 0.4266759860509859},

Of course, seeing Wakanda brought up a lot of questions: What\u2019s the deal with those sand-like 3D display systems they have? How do they make such good holographic images come out of stylish bracelets? How fast do those mag-lev trains go? And, perhaps most importantly, what are Wakandan cars like?\n\n\n\nOh, I guess I should mention there will likely be some kind of spoilers here, so, you know, I\u2019m warning you now. Here be spoilers. Run.\n\nNow, while we saw a number of very impressive Wakandan transportation machines: aircraft (possibly spacecraft as well?), mag-lev trains, what looked like a nice light-rail system, we never actually saw any Wakandan rolling, car-like automobiles. Perhaps their cities are designed to not require them, or perhaps they prefer mass-transit and air travel culturally; I\u2019m not really sure. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing some speculation about what a Wakandan car could be.\n\nI\u2019m actually thinking of a very specific kind of Wakandan car: a Wakandan export-market car. I\u2019m taking as a jumping-off point the events at the end of the movie, where Wakanda is finally abandoning their centuries-long self-imposed isolation from the world and will now become part of the global community, an act which will include the desemination of advanced Wakandan technology to the world, at least to some degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandan technology is based on the (again, sadly) fictional element known as Vibranium, of which Wakanda has an incredibly supply of, thanks to a massive meteorite of the stuff buried beneath the country. We see vibranium powering things like Black Panther\u2019s suit, for example, and it\u2019s clearly capable of some incredible things, which is why it\u2019s so incredibly valuable.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Wakandans will try to immediately upgrade the entire planet to the level of technology they enjoy; that would be a colossal undertaking, and not only am I not sure that makes sense for Wakanda, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even possible. What I do think will happen is that Wakanda will produce products for global consumption that, while largely similar to existing global technology, and as such are understandable and will work with current global infrastructure, will incorporate some amount of advanced Wakandan vibranum-based tech to make them better in some dramatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the Wakandan car will be like: it\u2019ll be essentially recognizable as a car, in that it will have wheels that can use tires you can buy from any local tire store and you\u2019ll drive it and use it in essentially the same way we use cars now, but it will have a huge vibranium-related advantage. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m imagining this first Wakandan export market car, the Wakanda Motors Ingwe (that\u2019s Xhosa for \u2018panther\u2019 or \u2018puma\u2019) , will be:\n\nIt\u2019ll be a hybrid, fundamentally. But with a very crucial difference. Where the hybrids the rest of the world builds rely on heavy, inefficient chemical storage batteries, the Wakandan car will use the remarkable energy-absorbing and releasing power of vibranium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this power in action in Black Panther\u2019s suit, which has vibranium fibers woven into it. Black Panther gets shot with a bullet, for example, but instead of peeing himself and dying like most of us would, the suit not only stops the bullet, but absorbs the considerable kinetic energy from the bullet, stores it, and later releases it when Black Panther wants to do something like punch a truck through a building.\n\nThe WM Ingwe would use this kinetic energy-storage and release property of vibranium to replace the heavy batteries of a hybrid. By building the cars with an alloy of aluminum and vibranium for the main parts of the frame, and perhaps some of the main body panels, the Wakandan car would have a structure that\u2019s not just light and incredibly strong, but capable of storing vast amounts of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause vibranium has so far only been shown as something that can store and release energy, not generate it, we\u2019d still need to provide some initial source energy into the system. It may be possible to set up some sort of \u2018charging stations\u2019 which input energy into the vibranium frame of the car, allowing for a purely electric vehicle, but I was thinking it might be more useful for these cars to use a small internal combustion engine to act as an initial source of energy; It could be a fairly small motor, one liter or less, maybe something equivalent to one of the small three-cylinder motors being built by Ford, GM, Mitsubishi, BMW, whoever.\n\nMaybe this part will be sourced outside of Wakanda, or maybe some Wakandan researchers will have fun developing a tiny, powerful ICE engine of their own. It doesn\u2019t really matter. My guess is it would be a better PR move if they partnered with local companies to produce this part of the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, probably the best move to keep from overly disrupting the global economy would be for them to just license the fundamental technology and provide the needed vibranium to companies all over the world. In that sense, think of the WM Ingwe as a sort of low-volume reference vehicle, with versions of the basic tech produced by established carmakers, under license.)\n\nThe ICE motor would get things started, turning gasoline or diesel into kinetic energy that would start \u2018charging\u2019 the vibranium frame, which would then provide power output to the main electric motor driving the rear axles. Let\u2019s say this is a Wakandan-designed motor, a scaled-down version of what they\u2019re already making for their trains or mining equipment or hover-ship windshield wipers. Based on their technological prowess with this stuff, I imagine this could be a pretty potent motor, certainly comparable to what Teslas use. Let\u2019s say it can produce a peak horsepower of 500, because why not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce in motion, the vibranium frame and body panels are collecting every bit of kinetic energy they encounter\u2014the molecules of air that hit the body of the car will transfer their kinetic energy to the system, the vibrations of the road, the motions of the passengers inside, along with more traditional energy reclamation systems like regenerative braking.\n\nHell, if the car was sitting for a while, and you forgot to put fuel in the ICE motor, you could probably get a good 10 or 20 miles of range by just pounding on the hood with your fists for a few minutes.\n\nVibranium has been shown to be incredibly effective at harvesting ambient kinetic energy; a few minutes of ICE-assisted driving would likely be enough to charge the vibranium up to the point where you could travel for 200 to 300 miles before needing to restart the gas engine\u2014perhaps more if it was windy, or if you, say, got caught in a rainstorm, with each raindrop adding a nice burst of energy to the car as it impacted the vibranium-alloy roof and hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you\u2019d have, essentially, is a hybrid car without the biggest disadvantage of a hybrid: the heavy, inefficient battery. The vibranium frame and body panels would be both an incredibly strong and safe structure for the car as well as all the energy storage the car needs. You could shave hundreds and hundreds of pounds from cars, eliminate the difficult and environmentally troubling mining of resources like lithium, and never worry about finding a charging station or if your battery pack is going to degrade to uselessness after 10 years.\n\nWith a car like this, the Wakandans could make every Prius (and likely Tesla) on the road obsolete overnight. Wakandan vibranium technology has the potential to make incredibly efficient automobiles without sacrificing range or performance. I can\u2019t wait until we start seeing these things on the market\u2014you\u2019d have to be an idiot to buy anything that didn\u2019t use Wakandan vibranium-based tech.\n\nOh, shit, right. This is fictional.

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible. And so it was really world-building in its truest form.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.", "keywords": ["creating", "vibranium", "complicated", "panther", "coogler", "exhilarating", "beachler", "process", "world", "wanted", "lot", "cole", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.1521029814067789, "subjectivity": 0.44748481476329593},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["production", "walks", "panther", "told", "different", "hannah", "beachler", "studiosdisney", "important", "world", "designer", "marvel", "africa", "know", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of. She\u2014and others like her\u2014deserve more options.\n\n", "keywords": ["nerd", "character", "black", "wasnt", "thats", "cosplay", "youre", "nice", "characters", "options", "convention", "28daysofblackcosplay"], "polarity": 0.12145721608408172, "subjectivity": 0.48781837565419656},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include.

Before he went on to make Blade, Wesley Snipes campaigned long and hard to get the ball rolling on a live-action Black Panther adaptation in which he would have starred. Though the project never quite came to fruition, Snipes\u2019 description of that \u201890s Black Panther film is a fascinating taste of what might have been.\n\n\n\nSnipes spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how his own Black Panther project actually got much farther along in the production process than most people realize (if they knew about it at all). Multiple scripts were written, Snipes himself (who was a hot commodity throughout the early-to-mid \u201890s) was attached to star, and both Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton were in the running to direct.\n\nBut for all the potential Snipes\u2019 Panther might have had, comic books and movies based on them didn\u2019t have the same kind of cultural cache and relevance that they do today and not everyone was on board with the idea of sticking close to the source material. Though Snipes felt it was important to emphasize Wakanda\u2019s technological prowess\u2014something we\u2019ll definitely be seeing in Marvel\u2019s film\u2014others, like Singleton, thought it would be smarter to go in a different direction:\n\n\u201cJohn was like, \u2018Nah! Hah! Hah! See, he\u2019s got the spirit of the Black Panther, but he is trying to get his son to join the [civil rights activist] organization. And he and his son have a problem, and they have some strife because he is trying to be politically correct and his son wants to be a knucklehead.\u2019 \u201c I am loosely paraphrasing our conversation. But ultimately, John wanted to take the character and put him in the civil rights movement. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude! Where\u2019s the toys?! They are highly technically advanced, and it will be fantastic to see Africa in this light opposed to how Africa is typically portrayed.\u2019 I wanted to see the glory and the beautiful Africa. The jewel Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnipes also described a number of other angles for the film that would have focused on a version of T\u2019Challa who didn\u2019t grow up in Wakanda in the years before he became king. As odd as that may sound, bear in mind that the \u201890s were a very, very different time for Marvel and Black Panther. At the time, Marvel had recently sold off the film rights to a number of its characters in an attempt to stave off its impending bankruptcy.\n\nEven though Columbia Pictures was interested in potentially producing Snipes\u2019 Black Panther, technological and budgetary constraints proved to be insurmountable issues. CGI wasn\u2019t anything close to what it\u2019s like today and capturing the sheer grandeur of Wakanda would have called for a gargantuan budget. It\u2019s nice to think that there was almost an OG Black Panther film that we could have been looking back on with fondness (or derision, who knows) for years, but to hear the way Snipes describes his vision for T\u2019Challa\u2019s vibranium suit, perhaps it\u2019s best the movie never got made:\n\n\u201cActually, I figured it would be a leotard. A leotard with maybe some little cat ears on it. I would have to be in shape and just be straight bodied up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["civil", "panther", "movement", "film", "reveals", "project", "snipes", "wesley", "90s", "wanted", "featured", "son", "rights", "africa", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.1213378442545109, "subjectivity": 0.4921153846153847},

The existing shows will remain on Netflix, but any new projects will be restricted to the new platforms.\n\nAll that being said, it is still an amazing idea, and Disney should really take the pro tip, which would make sense given Black Panther\u2019s wild success in cinemas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you think?

(Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["movie", "panther", "went", "film", "love", "world", "women", "live", "forever", "watching", "thing", "opening", "wakanda", "night", "black"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

Jordan. The exploits of the movie\u2019s title hero (Chadwick Boseman) and various members of his team are also throughly, lovingly captured by director and co-writer Ryan Coogler. But something does happen whenever the movie cuts over to Jordan\u2019s Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d Stevens: The scenes snap Coogler, and by extension his audience, out of the usual Marvel Cinematic Universe reverie of affection and amusement, bringing them to sharper attention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be unique to an MCU project, but it\u2019s not that unusual for Coogler\u2019s films, in part because he\u2019s a terrific filmmaker, and maybe also because all three of them\u2014Black Panther, Creed, and Fruitvale Station\u2014feature Jordan. It\u2019s not just a case of the camera loving Jordan, though he does have some of that innate star quality. Coogler seems especially fascinated by the actor\u2019s confidence\u2014his lack of obvious attempts to ingratiate himself\u2014and how that can transform the material he\u2019s given.\n\nAnd Jordan does help transform his material. None of his movies with Coogler are exactly unpredictable in terms of pure plot. This is even true of the groundbreaking Black Panther. On paper, Jordan\u2019s Erik follows an arc familiar to the MCU: He shares a semi-secret history with the film\u2019s costumed protagonist, spends his early scenes isolated from the other main characters as he gathers his resources and prepares to surprise the hero, and is pitted against that hero in a battle in which he functions as a mirror image, even donning his own panther-like supersuit.\n\nYet by handing this Marvel boilerplate over to Jordan, Coogler turns a well-worn structure into an affecting strategy. Erik\u2019s backstory, revealed well into the film, depends on his being left behind by the futuristic but closed-off country of Wakanda, abandoned in Coogler\u2019s hometown of Oakland following the death of his revolutionary father. He\u2019s one of the weightiest MCU villains, but Jordan doesn\u2019t charge straight into operatic intensity or even normal scenery-chewing. While most of the Wakanda characters speak in African-accented English that sounds regal and precise, Erik has a more colloquial American style, in which Jordan finds a wry musicality. His understated greeting of \u201cHey, auntie,\u201d directed at Wakandan royalty Ramonda (Angela Bassett), has a cultural specificity lacking from the MCU\u2019s easier laugh lines, and a human dimension sorely lacking from, say, the Red Skull. Jordan\u2019s performance depends on these small gestures, like when Erik addresses his Wakandan associates from the throne and taps his finger to betray a nervous energy behind his authority. Most supervillain performances play, with an understandable theatricality, to the audience. Jordan\u2019s speech patterns and little gestures are more self-possessed.\n\nPhoto: Black Panther (Marvel Studios/Disney)\n\nCoogler uses his gift for imagery to support Jordan\u2019s actorly choices, like the scene in which Erik approaches the Wakanda border with a crucial dead body in tow. This brief moment has a texture often lacking in comics movies, a kind of magic-hour idyll that nonetheless depicts an angry revolutionary carting around a corpse. Coogler also employs one of his favorite cinematic devices, the following shot, in which the camera pursues its subject. Killmonger isn\u2019t the only one who gets this treatment; Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa has one of his own as he approaches his crowning ceremony. But the most striking version in the movie stays on Killmonger\u2019s back, not Black Panther\u2019s. As Erik assumes the Wakandan throne, the camera begins upside down and makes a full, deliberate 180-degree turn, both a stylish image and a crystallization of the moment when Killmonger transitions from angry outsider to the man in charge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan\u2019s willingness to be still, and explode with emotion when needed, seem to embolden Coogler\u2019s nervier instincts. This was the case before Black Panther, when Coogler made another franchise movie that gave him even more stylistic flexibility. Creed, in which Jordan plays the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent-turned-buddy Apollo Creed, isn\u2019t building an expansion on an expensive, elaborate, ongoing piece of Marvel architecture, but working off of a series bible written mostly (and haphazardly) by Rocky star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. This allows Coogler and Jordan to reshape the material and make the best Rocky movie since the first one.\n\nCreed doesn\u2019t give Jordan a lot of dialogue upfront. Adonis Creed\u2019s first lines in the movie are spoken by an actor playing him as a kid, and he\u2019s first seen as an adult getting himself psyched up for a fight before the camera follows him up some stairs, mostly in shadow, and into the boxing ring. Other early scenes, all providing the character with degrees of standoffishness, rely on his seething intensity\u2014and accompanying sense of isolation. Even his first conversation with his love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), gets abruptly curtailed as she slams a door in his face.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat, subtle trick Coogler plays to maintain Creed\u2019s underdog status despite what appears to be a more privileged background than Balboa. The fact that Jordan\u2019s ultra-persistent Creed doesn\u2019t replicate the aw-shucks humility of Rocky counts as a bold gambit in a big-studio environment that demands selfless gestures, cardboard villains, children in peril\u2026 anything to score some more precious likability. Creed works so well because Jordan spends so little time asking for approval, which gives his late-movie mid-fight admission to Balboa, that he\u2019s fighting to prove that he\u2019s not a \u201cmistake,\u201d the force of a major body blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Creed\u2019s boxing legacy, the movie succeeds in keeping its characters at ground level, which Coogler emphasizes with more following shots. Some of them have a traditional boxer-into-the-ring iconic grandeur, while others, like Creed\u2019s entrance into Bianca\u2019s apartment, are more intimate, bringing the audience along with the character rather than staring in awe at his majesty. There\u2019s a similar sense of intimacy in the sequence when Coogler follows Jordan and Stallone together from a Philadelphia street, up some stairs, and around the floor of a boxing gym, simply because after a lot of scenes that isolate Jordan, the two stars share the frame for nearly the entire length of the unbroken shot.\n\nAlthough both Creed and Panther have a broader visual vocabulary, it\u2019s their following shots that forge the strongest visual connections between the earliest, least flashy Coogler/Jordan collaboration. Fruitvale Station, a dramatization of the 24 hours leading up to the real-life police shooting of Oscar Grant III, an unarmed Bay Area resident, packs a clear emotional punch, and its relevance sadly hasn\u2019t faded at all since its 2013 release. In the context of Coogler\u2019s career, though, it feels like an extremely promising tryout. Plenty of filmmakers\u2014hopefully most\u2014improve after their first film, but it\u2019s rare to find a director who can follow a Sundance indie with two straight franchise movies and have the franchise movies feel more personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Fruitvale, Coogler and Jordan haven\u2019t come to experiment or dazzle. Stylewise, the movie stays within contemporary American indie aesthetics, with lots of handheld camera and plainspoken realism (sort of Gus Van Sant lite). Jordan talks more, with a slightly Casey Affleck-ish rasp, and spells out more of his character\u2019s feelings. Most of the movie\u2019s stylistic flourishes are accordingly less sustained, part of its slice-of-life approach: Coogler\u2019s camera follows Oscar into his bedroom as he hastily cleans up and grabs some marijuana that he intends to sell; down the greeting card aisle of a store; and with handheld jitteriness as he approaches the canine victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nBut there are also distinctive if still unshowy stretches: one following shot of Oscar as he walks through his daughter\u2019s school, leading seamlessly into a brief scene with his daughter on the school\u2019s backyard playground, and another that travels with him and his friends up the escalator out of the BART system and onto the streets of San Francisco. The camera isn\u2019t constantly at Jordan\u2019s back but it scarcely lets him out of its sight\u2014a queasily effective strategy given Oscar\u2019s tragic end.\n\nThat coiled quality of waiting for a vicious inevitability lies more with the story of Fruitvale than Jordan\u2019s performance; the real-life events take over and can\u2019t provide the emotional release of an extremely fictional crowd-pleaser like Black Panther or Creed. But Jordan does get to show tremendous range of the everyday-life variety: warmth with his daughter, frustration with his limited job options, guilt over lying to his mom about using a cellphone earpiece while he drives, sly charm in a scene where he talks a shop owner into letting a couple of women in to use the bathroom. That this character\u2019s reality extends to a terrifying and violent police stop makes the movie chilling, and Jordan keeps it from feeling too much like a pure exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is in almost every single scene of Fruitvale, most of the scenes in Creed, and comparatively fewer in Black Panther. This progression would make it seem like Coogler is weaning himself off of his muse, if not for the fact that Jordan\u2019s potency only increases as their collaboration goes on. He commands the screen in Fruitvale, emerges as a real movie star in Creed, and by Black Panther does so much with his half hour or so of screen time that his presence looms over the whole movie despite barely appearing in it for the first hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the single most affecting scene of Black Panther, Coogler holds back his star, trusting him to deliver in small doses. During a dream sequence, Erik speaks to his departed father (Sterling K. Brown), and in a single cut, Coogler brings Erik back to the pre-teen age he was when his dad was killed. Their interaction continues without missing a beat, and when he cuts back to the adult Erik, still in the dream, a tear streaming down Jordan\u2019s cheek, the scared, angry kid of seconds earlier is still there in Jordan\u2019s eyes. Inserting a kid actor into the scene could come off like a filmmaking shortcut, a way to wring emotion out of the scene faster. But it works beautifully because Coogler trusts Jordan to create continuity with those shots of his character\u2019s younger self. The scene has a recognizably real-world sense of tragedy with few, if any, equals in the MCU.\n\nThis carries over into the film\u2019s action climax. As they fight for Wakanda\u2019s fate, Erik and T\u2019Challa are forcefully separated by a vibranium-powered subway that temporarily de-powers their supersuits (Star Wars diehards may recall a similar physical setup in a Phantom Menace duel). Coogler uses the strategic halt in action as an opportunity for Erik to expose his pain, his sense that the world has taken everything from him, an outburst not unlike Creed\u2019s moment of ringside catharsis. Excitingly staged fisticuffs pause for sustained heartbreak. Black Panther has some Marvel limitations, but Coogler seems excited to readjust pop touchstones while pushing Jordan to the fore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan and Coogler are both extremely talented, and will doubtlessly do great work apart. (A fourth collaboration between the two, the test-cheating drama Wrong Answer, has already been announced). Their work together so far, though, feels emboldened like the best star/filmmaker collaborations. In this case, Jordan and Coogler have been able to address aspects of being black in America in all of their movies in pretty disparate genres. Other filmmakers have treated Jordan like a more traditional star. In his movies without Coogler, including two other superhero pictures from now-disgraced director Josh Trank (the found-footage Chronicle and the most recent attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four), he\u2019s still charismatic. But his material leans heavily on that charisma, rather than pushing it beyond movie-star likability. Chronicle seems to at least understand his magnetism, but Fantastic Four strands him and the rest of the cast, while his single foray into comedy, That Awkward Moment, burdens him with the movie\u2019s most serious subplot (though he\u2019s not any worse off than the cast members who have to labor under the impression that their antics are amusing).\n\nAs Jordan becomes more famous, presumably other filmmakers will figure out how to use him more effectively and consistently. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine another director matching the thrill of Coogler and Jordan getting on each other\u2019s wavelength, modulating big stylistic leaps with subtler performance notes (and, when necessary, vice versa), digging beyond the surface pleasures of their talents. Their collective gravity brings even the biggest movies down to earth.", "keywords": ["movie", "panther", "coogler", "b", "scene", "michael", "creed", "jordan", "goes", "erik", "movies", "partnership", "ryan", "jordans", "gameraising", "black"], "polarity": 0.09555645743145742, "subjectivity": 0.4853012265512266},

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career. But when director Ryan Coogler came to her and asked if she wanted to star in his adaptation of Black Panther, she was so eager to join the project, she didn\u2019t even pause to read the script first.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvel called and said that Ryan was interested in me for a role in Panther, and I talked to him about it, and obviously everything was hush-hush, but he walked me through his initial ideas, and I thought, \u2018Wait a minute? This is a Marvel movie?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Nyong\u2019o shared that she agreed to play warrior Nakia without having read the script, first opening its pages after shooting began. She said it was because she was thrilled about the story Coogler was telling, about an African country that had \u201cmanaged to keep its autonomy and be self-determining\u201d because it was shielded from colonization. Nyong\u2019o, whose father is a prominent opposition leader in Kenyan politics, said the film\u2019s implicit political themes also drew her to the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe were creating an aspirational world where an African people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy. To just have African people, black people, at the center of that narrative is so exciting.\u201d\n\nOf course, just because she didn\u2019t read the script first doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t committed. Coogler commented about her dedication to the project, saying she did \u201ca lot of homework\u201d on Black Panther in order to understand her role and the country of Wakanda. She spent months doing rigorous physical training for the complex stunt work, focusing on jujitsu and capoeira, and even injured herself during shooting. Nyong\u2019o also said she had to learn to speak with the accent actor Chadwick Boseman took on for the role, which meant utilizing clicking sounds. \u201cThere\u2019s three different clicks, like three different letters,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther comes out February 16 and we can\u2019t wait to see Nyong\u2019o in action.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["didnt", "african", "script", "panther", "different", "read", "coogler", "wait", "nyongo", "lupita", "sign", "pumped", "role", "black"], "polarity": 0.1191919191919192, "subjectivity": 0.3822330447330447},

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man.

We all have a friend who has pressed pause on their bootleg DVD of Hidden Colors long enough to explain why they aren\u2019t interested in seeing the movie Black Panther because they know how Hollywood poisons the minds of our people, and what we need to do is stop dreaming about vibranium and invest our resources in uplifting our community.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of explaining how you just wanted to see some fictional cool shit with black people on the screen the same way white people get to see Harry Potter, Star Wars and The Passion of the Christ (yes, a Caucasian Jesus is more fantastical than a broom-riding white witch-boy or an evil Jedi with asthma).\n\nYou could engage in an extended argument with your friend, explaining that if black people weren\u2019t capable of separating fiction from reality, we\u2019d be waiting for Blade to kill Donald Trump, believe that the Civil War was about the North\u2019s unwillingness to serve iced tea, and think that Martin Luther King Jr. was a timid little Southern preacher who helped change the minds of the tiny percentage of white Americans who simply wanted to sit in the front seats on public transportation.\n\nLuckily, instead of listening to all that noise, you can just present your faux-tep friend with this short quiz to determine whether or not they are too woke for Black Panther.\n\n1.

The Black Panther is:\n\na) Cool as fuck.\n\nb) T\u2019Challa\u2019s alter ego.\n\nc) A flawed character caught between doing what\u2019s right for his people and owning up to the responsibility of his powerful gift.\n\nd) An attempt by the white supremacist gay agenda to feminize black boys by making them wear tight clothes and ostentatious jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Which of these schools is fictional?\n\na) The Wakanda Girls School for Science and Technology.\n\nb) The Dora Milaje Institute for Self-Defense.\n\nc) The Frederick Douglass/Killmonger Academy for Black Boys.\n\nd) Morehouse.\n\n5. Erik Killmonger:\n\na) Is a well-rounded antagonist who inspires sympathy while still playing the villain.\n\nb) Needs to put some shea butter on those chicken pox bumps.\n\nc) Wouldn\u2019t have been so angry if he had been invited to the family reunion and met his cousins a long time ago.\n\nd) Is a revolutionary Pan-Africanist who wants to free his people by any means necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6.

But actually seeing the commercial for what Hasbro is offering made me pause and feel something deeply emotional.\n\nIf you ask many comic book fans of color which characters they grew up loving, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll name a white character like Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Batman. To be fair, these characters are great, but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re exponentially more widely marketed across a variety of media than other characters and so people come to know and identify with them more readily.\n\nA big part of how we come to love characters has to do with how much we\u2019re exposed to them and how often we\u2019re able to see ourselves in them in a meaningful way. Reading as the Black Panther and his genius sister Shuri save the world in the pages of comics is one thing, but seeing young black children actually embody those characters while having fun is something much more powerful. That\u2019s what makes Hasbro\u2019s line of Black Panther toys and the way the company\u2019s marketing them so incredibly fantastic.\n\n\n\nIn the first ad the company released, a black boy dons T\u2019Challa\u2019s Black Panther mask and claws, while a black girl along with a non-black friend wield Shuri\u2019s panther gauntlets as the trio are transported from their backyard directly to Wakanda. Obviously, the mask and claws are plastic with a bit of circuitry in them and the gauntlets are a new kind of Nerf gun but to be clear\u2014you almost never see toy ads aimed at and starring black children, and starring as the leads no less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause characters of color have historically been relatively marginalized in movies, comics, and television, toys and commercials like this simply haven\u2019t existed before which is a shame in and of itself but has deeper consequences. Oftentimes, the first step towards becoming a fan of something or part of a larger fandom is finding a character that you can relate to when you\u2019re young and then seeing your relationship with them validated by the world around you.\n\n\n\nThat feedback loop of identification, and then affirmation, is what creates the ideas that \u201cI can be a hero too\u201d and \u201cthis fandom can be a place for me, as well.\u201d Toys and commercials like these, perhaps even more than the movies they\u2019re promoting, can have a way of creating lasting impressions and memories on kids for whom they\u2019re a gateway into a larger world of fantasy and scifi. Suddenly, they\u2014along with T\u2019Challa and co.\u2014are the ones defeating villains and protecting the planet. That kind of direct representation can have a profound impact on one\u2019s self-esteem in the long term.\n\nYes, these are just toys, but at the same time, they\u2019re so much more. They\u2019re an invitation\u2014an affirmation\u2014and something I wish I\u2019d had when I was growing up.", "keywords": ["way", "commercial", "panther", "theyre", "seeing", "understand", "starring", "world", "characters", "young", "toy", "important", "toys", "black"], "polarity": 0.17847673160173153, "subjectivity": 0.4506551484230054},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["veronica", "film", "black", "wear", "style", "look", "love", "images", "getty", "marvel", "wanna", "styles", "wakanda", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["panther", "welcome", "york", "bnyfw", "guests", "stage", "venue", "till", "designer", "week", "wakanda", "black"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see.

Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks.

Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us.

No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder.

If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined.

No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged.

As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues.

While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding, Killmonger chooses death later on instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut, and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future. How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that [he] had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees, Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him, and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wakanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully, she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving as two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film, and she thinks that that is enough for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the Kingsguard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrupt, so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cFuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference: Killmonger reminds me of Cersei; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cersei has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cersei literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule; he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid. What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin. Of course, this would mean that both Black Panther, life and blackness at large is layered and ultimately complex. And what is blackness if not complex?", "keywords": ["okoye", "panther", "wakanda", "film", "double", "nakia", "duality", "erik", "mbaku", "throne", "tchalla", "killmonger", "consciousness", "black"], "polarity": 0.08616535174227478, "subjectivity": 0.4667148022917254},
{"url": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/black-women-are-black-panthers-mightiest-heroes-1823205912", "title": "/black-women-are-black-panthers-mightiest-heroes-", "text": "Photo: Marvel\n\nAs more and more of the public flocks to theaters to catch a Black Panther screening, much of the conversation\u2019s been dedicated to comparing and contrasting T\u2019Challa and Killmonger\u2019s opposing views on the role Wakanda should be playing\u2014and should have played\u2014outside of its borders. But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["movie", "finally", "lowe", "fans", "talk", "internets", "panther", "white", "work", "going", "friends", "colston", "favorite", "look", "wakanda", "video", "black"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549}
